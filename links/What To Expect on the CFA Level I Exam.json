{"What To Expect on the CFA Level I Exam": {"text": "The Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designation is one of the most sought-after credentials for investment professionals. However, becoming a CFA charter holder is not for the fainthearted nor the uninterested. The journey to becoming a CFA charter holder is long, and it tests not only knowledge of the subject but also endurance, diligence, and will.\nAccording to the CFA Institute, the current program is best described as a self-study, distance-learning program that takes a generalist approach to investment analysis, valuation, and portfolio management, and emphasizes the highest ethical and professional standards.\nThe CFA program consists of three exams: the CFA Level I, Level II, and Level III. CFA candidates are required to pass each of these exams and must meet certain work requirements as set out by the CFA Institute. The CFA exams are also difficult to pass; in May 2022, the passing rate for the Level I exam was just 38%, compared with an average Level I pass rate of 41% for the 1963-to-May 2022 period.\nThe curriculum for each of these three levels is designed to test a broad array of skills considered to be most relevant for\u00a0investment professions. In this article, we will focus on the CFA Level I exam.\nThe exam is a computer-based exam split between two 135-minute sessions. The exam consists of 180 multiple-choice questions: 90 questions in the first session and 90 questions in the second session. Candidates should allow approximately 90 seconds per question, depending on their knowledge of the topics.\nAll of the multiple-choice questions are free-standing (i.e., they are not dependent on each other). For each question, three possible choices are provided. The questions are crafted intelligently, such that the incorrect choices reflect common mistakes in calculation or logic. Candidates should aim to answer all questions, as there is no penalty for incorrect answers.\nAdditionally, it is essential to become comfortable with calculator functions, as these features will be needed to complete some of the questions.\nThe exam focuses on basic knowledge and comprehension of tools and concepts of investment valuation and portfolio management.\u00a0The curriculum consists of 10 topic areas that cover key subjects including ethical and professional standards, investment tools, asset classes, and portfolio management and wealth planning.\nThe following table provides the\u00a0approximate weights of these topic areas for the 2022 Level I exam.\nSource: CFA Institute.\nThis section covers the code of ethics, professional standards, and the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS). There are approximately 27 to 36 questions on the subject, and the Institute itself takes this section very seriously. If scores are low or close to the minimum passing score on all other topics, then the score on this section could determine whether a candidate passes or fails. One advantage of studying ethics well is that it also helps with Level II and Level III exam preparation.\nWhile ethics is more scenario-oriented and easy to follow, the quantitative methods section could be intimidating for some students. A Ph.D. in mathematics is not necessary to do well in quantitative methods, but having a background in statistics will certainly be helpful. An 8%-to-12% weight means that candidates should expect anywhere from 15 to 22 questions on quantitative methods. The topics covered are geared toward providing knowledge of analytical tools and techniques that are essential for financial analysis and investment decision-making.\nThe key topics covered are the time value of money and discounted cash flow analysis, which form the basis for security and asset valuation; descriptive statistics that convey important data attributes, and characteristics of return distributions; and probability theory and its application to quantifying risk in investment decision making.\nThe economics section tests knowledge of basic micro and macroeconomic concepts. These include supply and demand analysis; various market structures such as oligopoly and monopoly; aggregate output, prices, and economic growth; and business cycles and their effect on economic activity. Economics comprises between 8% to 12% of the Level I exam.\nThis is the second-largest section on the Level I exam, with a 13%-to-17% weight. Financial reporting and analysis have only a slightly lower weight for the Level II course, so it's important to spend enough time studying this area to build a solid foundation for subsequent exams.\nCandidates will be asked to analyze and interpret primary financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement), know the ratios, and many other advanced concepts such as revenue recognition, inventory analysis, long-term assets, and taxes.\nSince the exam is a global exam, it does not cover local accounting practices. The focus is more on widely accepted standards, such as U.S. GAAP and IFRS.\nAfter financial reporting and analysis is the section on corporate finance, which has an 8%-to-12% weight in the Level I exam. It provides an introduction to corporate governance, as well as investing and financing decisions. This subject area also highlights the growing impact of environmental and social considerations in investing. Key topics include capital budgeting, cost of capital, leverage, and working capital management.\nThe Level I exam only introduces the basics of portfolio management. The important concepts are the Modern Portfolio Theory and the Capital Asset Pricing Model. There are between 9 and 15 questions in this section, which acts as preparation for Levels II and III, where the focus is more on the application of knowledge on portfolio management.\nThe section on equities covers equity markets and instruments, as well as tools and techniques for valuing companies. Candidates should pay close attention to this section because it lays the foundation for further study in Levels II and III. Approximately 10% to 12% of the questions on the Level I exam are on equities, and the majority of the questions are focused on valuing and analyzing companies.\nAfter equities, the exam next deals with fixed-income markets and their instruments. Candidates are required to understand the characteristics of various fixed-income securities and how to price them. Some important concepts are the yield measures and duration and convexity. This section also discusses structured products, such as mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, among others. Questions on fixed income comprise 10% to 12% of the exam.\nSimilar to portfolio management, derivatives are only introduced in Level I. Candidates will be tested on the basics of futures, forwards, swaps, options, and hedging techniques using these derivatives. Similar to portfolio management, this section only has a 5%-to-8% weight in the Level I exam, which equates to between 9 and 15 questions.\nThis section focuses on alternative investments including real estate, private equity, hedge funds, infrastructure, and commodities. The Level I curriculum for alternative investments is of an introductory nature, with a 5%-to-8% exam weight, so expect between 9 and 15 questions. Given the growing importance of this asset class in recent periods, and the fact that it has a slightly higher weight in Levels II and III, candidates should treat this section seriously.\nAll CFA exams are now administered through computer-based testing at proctored exam centers in over 400 locations globally. The exam centers have tight security measures in place, and each center closely monitors candidates to detect any form of cheating. The CFA Institute offers the following test-taking tips for CFA Level I Exam Day:\nThere is an optional break of 30 minutes between Session 1 and Session 2.\nAccording to CFA Institute, the average successful candidate reported spending 303 hours studying for the Level I exam offered in June 2019.\nBeginning in 2021, every candidate who does not pass their exam will have to wait for a minimum of six months to retake it.\nOverall, the CFA Level I exam is well balanced, with a wide spectrum of topics. Some topics may require proportionally more time to study than others; however, what's important is to create a study plan and stay with it.\nCFA Institute. \"CFA Program.\"\nCFA Institute. \"Exam

investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\nInvestopedia / Paige McLaughlin\nA forward contract is a customized contract between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a specified price on a future date. A forward contract can be used for hedging or speculation, although its non-standardized nature makes it particularly apt for hedging.\nUnlike standard futures contracts, a forward contract can be customized to a commodity, amount, and delivery date. Commodities traded can be grains, precious metals, natural gas, oil, or even poultry. A forward contract settlement can occur on a cash or delivery basis.\nForward contracts do not trade on a centralized exchange and are therefore regarded as over-the-counter (OTC) instruments. While their OTC nature makes it easier to customize terms, the lack of a centralized clearinghouse also gives rise to a higher degree of default risk.\nBecause of their potential for default risk and lack of a centralized clearinghouse, forward contracts are not as easily available to retail investors as futures contracts.\nBoth forward and futures contracts involve the agreement to buy or sell a commodity at a set price in the future. But there are slight differences between the two. While a forward contract does not trade on an exchange, a futures contract does.\nSettlement for the forward contract takes place at the end of the contract, while the futures contract settles on a daily basis. Most importantly, futures contracts exist as standardized contracts that are not customized between counterparties.\nConsider the following example of a forward contract. Assume that an agricultural producer has two million bushels of corn to sell six months from now and is concerned about a potential decline in the price of corn. It thus enters into a forward contract with its financial institution to sell two million bushels of corn at a price of $4.30 per bushel in six months, with settlement on a cash basis.\nIn six months, the spot price of corn has three possibilities:\nThe market for forward contracts is huge since many of the world\u2019s biggest corporations use it to hedge currency and interest rate risks. However, since the details of forward contracts are restricted to the buyer and seller\u2014and are not known to the general public\u2014the size of this market is difficult to estimate.\nThe large size and unregulated nature of the forward contracts market mean that it may be susceptible to a cascading series of defaults in the worst-case scenario. While banks and financial corporations mitigate this risk by being very careful in their choice of counterparty, the possibility of large-scale default does exist.\nAnother risk that arises from the non-standard nature of forward contracts is that they are only settled on the settlement date and are not marked-to-market like futures. What if the forward rate specified in the contract diverges widely from the spot rate at the time of settlement?\nIn this case, the financial institution that originated the forward contract is exposed to a greater degree of risk in the event of default or non-settlement by the client than if the contract were marked-to-market regularly.\nCME Group. \"Futures Contracts Compared to

Analyst (LIFA)": {"text": "Adam Hayes, Ph.D., CFA, is a financial writer with 15+ years Wall Street experience as a derivatives trader. Besides his extensive derivative trading expertise, Adam is an expert in economics and behavioral finance. Adam received his master's in economics from The New School for Social Research and his Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in sociology. He is a CFA charterholder as well as holding FINRA Series 7, 55 & 63 licenses. He currently researches and teaches economic sociology and the social studies of finance at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.\nThe Licensed International Financial Analyst (LIFA) is a global professional credential for investment professionals offered by The International Research Association. The LIFA designation helps candidates attain higher levels of professionalism and ethics in the profession of investment management and analysis. Exams require in-depth knowledge of investment principles, along with an understanding of global capital markets. The program involves passing three exams before a candidate can receive their designation.\nThe International Research Association is an organization that is committed to providing investment professionals with a way to work and compete in the financial marketplace. The IRA does this by offering the Licensed International Financial Analyst designation. The IRA began developing the program in 1999 and is \"recognized by the highest professional and ethical standards.\"\nLike the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA), the LIFA designation requires candidates to pass three proctored examinations. Subject areas covered by the tests include asset valuation, corporate finance, derivatives, economics, financial statement analysis, ethics, portfolio management, international markets, and quantitative analysis.\nBilled as the toughest exam in finance, the LIFA program was created to be a direct competitor to the CFA charter. There is no cost to register for the program or to take the three exams. In fact, candidates only pay if they pass.\nThe IRA attempts to keep the pass rate at an acceptable (or lower) level, believing that the validity of the designation is based on pass rates, and thus the quality of the designees: lower pass rates equal a more valuable designation. The pass rates on the LIFA are also lower than the notoriously difficult set of CFA examinations, with LIFA claiming average historical pass rates on:\nThe cost per LIFA exam is $750.\nUnlike other programs like the CFA, which allows for those who fail to retake a test an unlimited number of times, the LIFA has a strict limit of only four attempts per exam level. Once the LIFA designation has been earned, members must pay annual dues of $275 to maintain their membership and credentials. That is the same cost for an annual membership with the CFA Institute.\nThe completion of all three exams in this program allows a professional to achieve the recognition that they have attained the highest levels of professionalism and ethical standards in the investment industry. The main focus of the LIFA exam is to measure professional excellence in a broad curriculum of investment-related subjects. The main topic areas include:\nFor an in-depth breakdown of the above topics described, refer to the PDF curriculum guide provided by the International Research Association. More details of the exam(s) include:\nThe LIFA program doesn't charge any rescheduling fees, which means there's no charge if you need to change the date of your exam.\nAs noted above, the LIFA is a financial designation that aims at helping financial professionals excel in their chosen fields in the same way the Chartered Financial Analyst designation does. But there are some key differences between the two. The table below highlights some of the key distinctions between these two professional credentials.\nThe November 2022 pass rates for the CFA exams, the most recently-available data, are 36% for Level I, 44% for Level II, and 48% for Level III. They are higher than those for each LIFA exam.\nInternational Research Association - Licensed International Financial Analyst. \"LIFA Exam Program Level I Curriculum & Guide.\"\nInternational Research

Russell 1000 for value, growth, and momentum, respectively\nAzenta Inc., Coterra Energy Inc., and First Solar Inc. are the top performers in the Russell 1000 Index for value, growth, and momentum, respectively. The index tracks the 1,000 largest companies by market capitalization in the U.S.\nLife sciences company Azenta's shares fell almost 17% in early February after it said revenue for the most recent quarter missed analyst estimates and offered disappointing guidance. Analysts are looking for growth to pick up and cost-cutting measures to take effect in the second half of the year.\nCoterra, the product of the 2021 merger of two energy exploration and production companies, posted rising revenue and profits last year thanks to that merger and rising energy prices.\nFirst Solar's stock received a boost from the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which includes tax credits for residential and commercial solar installation.\nThese stocks are leading their categories at a time when the Russell 1000 Index has lost about a tenth of its value. Many companies in the index are grappling with a slowing economy, inflation, supply chain disruptions, and a series of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.\nBelow, we list the top five stocks in each category: value, growth, and momentum. These rankings are based on an Investopedia analysis of YCharts data. All company data are as of Feb. 21, while index data are as of Feb. 28.\nValue investing\u00a0is a\u00a0factor-based investing\u00a0strategy that involves picking stocks that you believe are trading for less than what they are intrinsically worth, usually measured by the ratio of the stock\u2019s price to one or more\u00a0fundamental business metrics. A widely accepted value metric is the\u00a0price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Value investors say that if a business is cheap compared with its intrinsic value (as measured by its P/E ratio, in this case), then the stock price may rise faster than others' as the price comes back in line with the worth of the company. These are among the stocks with the lowest 12-month trailing P/E ratio.\nSource:\u00a0YCharts\nThese are the top stocks as ranked by a\u00a0growth\u00a0model that scores companies based on a 50/50 weighting of their most recent quarterly year-on-year (YOY) percentage revenue growth and their most recent quarterly YOY earnings per share (EPS) growth.\nBoth sales and earnings are critical factors in the success of a company. Therefore, ranking companies by only one growth metric makes a ranking susceptible to the accounting anomalies of that quarter (such as changes in tax law or restructuring costs) that may make one or the other figure unrepresentative of the business in general. Companies with quarterly EPS or revenue growth of more than 2,500% were excluded as outliers.\nSource:\u00a0YCharts\nMomentum investing is a factor-based investing strategy that involves buying a stock whose price has risen faster than the market as a whole. Momentum investors believe that stocks that have outperformed the market will often continue to do so because the factors that caused them to outperform will not suddenly disappear.\nIn addition, other investors seeking to benefit from the stock\u2019s outperformance will often purchase it, further bidding its price higher. These are the stocks that had the highest total return over the past 12 months.\nSource:\u00a0YCharts\nTo become a top stock, a company most likely produces positive trends in its earnings, revenue, and share price. Momentum in these areas indicates a well-run business that has the potential to keep generating a profit and to create shareholder value.\nInvestors can use free stock screening sites like Finviz to find top stocks, filtering by both fundamental and technical momentum. For example, a trader could find a top stock by scanning for companies that are trading at a new 52-week high or that have grown their earnings consistently over the past five years.\nTop stocks typically receive extensive media coverage and are followed by leading Wall Street analysts. This usually means more liquidity in the order book, leading to better prices and faster trade executions. Moreover, top stocks with ample liquidity are more difficult for larger players to manipulate, helping to keep a fair and orderly market.\nInvesting only in top large-cap stocks means that investors may miss profitable opportunities in other areas of the stock market. Some of the most significant gains come from small-cap stocks under the radar. For example, an unknown small biotechnology company may announce a breakthrough discovery that propels its share price higher. Even if investors favor trading top stocks, allocating a portion of capital to other stock groups helps avoid missing compelling opportunities.\nThe trend is your friend\u2014until it's not. Even large-cap top stocks with a track record of earnings growth and creating shareholder value encounter unforeseen challenges. For example, cruise line companies, such as Carnival Corp. (CCL) and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NCLH), reported increased revenue in the years leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic but watched their top line sink to unprecedented lows for several years due to no-sail orders and a collapse in passenger demand.\nWhen investing in top stocks, investors should always use a stop-loss order to protect against sudden trend reversals.\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed herein are for informational purposes only and should not be considered individual investment advice or recommendations to invest in any security or adopt any investment strategy.
