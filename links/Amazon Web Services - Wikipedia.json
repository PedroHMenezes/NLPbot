{"Amazon Web Services - Wikipedia": {"text": "Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS) is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered, pay-as-you-go basis. Often times, clients will use this in combination with autoscaling (a process that allows a client to use more compute in times of high application usage, and then scale down to reduce costs when there is less traffic). These cloud computing web services provide various services related to networking, compute, storage, middleware, IOT and other processing capacity, as well as software tools via AWS server farms.  This frees clients from managing, scaling, and patching hardware and operating systems. \nOne of the foundational services is Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), which allows users to have at their disposal a virtual cluster of computers, with extremely high availability, which can be interacted with over the internet via REST APIs, a CLI or the AWS console.  AWS's virtual computers emulate most of the attributes of a real computer, including hardware central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) for processing; local/RAM memory; hard-disk/SSD storage; a choice of operating systems; networking; and pre-loaded application software such as web servers, databases, and customer relationship management (CRM).\nAWS services are delivered to customers via a network of AWS server farms located throughout the world. Fees are based on a combination of usage (known as a \"Pay-as-you-go\" model), hardware, operating system, software, or networking features chosen by the subscriber required availability, redundancy, security, and service options. Subscribers can pay for a single virtual AWS computer, a dedicated physical computer, or clusters of either.[8] Amazon provides select portions of security for subscribers (e.g. physical security of the data centers) while other aspects of security are the responsibility of the subscriber (e.g. account management, vulnerability scanning, patching). AWS operates from many global geographical regions including seven in North America.[9]\nAmazon markets AWS to subscribers as a way of obtaining large-scale computing capacity more quickly and cheaply than building an actual physical server farm.[10] All services are billed based on usage, but each service measures usage in varying ways. As of 2021 Q4, AWS has 33% market share for cloud infrastructure while the next two competitors Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud have 21%, and 10% respectively, according to Synergy Group.[11][12]\nAs of 2021, AWS comprises over 200[13] products and services including computing, storage, networking, database, analytics, application services, deployment, management, machine learning,[14] mobile, developer tools, RobOps and tools for the Internet of Things. The most popular include Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon Connect, and AWS Lambda (a serverless function that can perform arbitrary code written in any language that can be configured to be triggered by hundreds of events, including http calls).[15]\nServices expose functionality through APIs for clients to use in their applications.  These APIs are accessed over HTTP, using the REST architectural style and SOAP protocol for older APIs and exclusively JSON for newer ones. Clients can interact with these APIs in various ways, including from the AWS console (a website), by using SDKs written in various languages (such as Python, Java, and JavaScript), or by making direct REST calls.\nThe genesis of AWS came in the early 2000s. After building Merchant.com, Amazon's e-commerce-as-a-service platform that offers third-party retailers a way to build their own web-stores, Amazon pursued service-oriented architecture as a means to scale its engineering operations,[16][17][18][19][20][21][22] led by then CTO Allan Vermeulen.[23]\nAround the same time frame, Amazon was frustrated with the speed of its software engineering, and sought to implement various recommendations put forth by Matt Round, an engineering leader at the time, including maximization of autonomy for engineering teams, adoption of REST, standardization of infrastructure, removal of gate-keeping decision-makers (bureaucracy), and continuous deployment. He also called for increasing the percentage of the time engineers spent building the software rather than doing other tasks.[24] Amazon created \"a shared IT platform\" so its engineering organizations, which were spending 70% of their time on \"undifferentiated heavy-lifting\" such as IT and infrastructure problems, could focus on customer-facing innovation instead.[25] Besides, in dealing with unusual peak traffic patterns, especially during the holiday season, by migrating services to commodity Linux hardware and relying on open source software, Amazon's Infrastructure team, led by Tom Killalea,[26] Amazon's first CISO,[27] had already run its data centers and associated services in a \"fast, reliable, cheap\" way.[26]\nIn July 2002, Amazon.com Web Services, managed by Colin Bryar,[28] launched its first web services, opening up the Amazon.com platform to all developers.[29] Over one hundred applications were built on top of it by 2004.[30]  This unexpected developer interest took Amazon by surprise and convinced them that developers were \"hungry for more.\"[25]\nBy the Summer of 2003, Andy Jassy had taken over Bryar's portfolio[31] at Rick Dalzell's behest, after Vermeulen, who was Bezos' first pick, declined the offer.[23] Jassy subsequently mapped out the vision for an \"Internet OS\"[16][18][20][32] made up of foundational infrastructure primitives that alleviated key impediments to shipping software applications faster.[16][17][18][20][22] By fall 2003,[16][18] databases, storage, and compute were identified as the first set of infrastructure pieces that Amazon should launch.[16][18][25]\nJeff Barr, an early AWS employee, credits Vermeulen, Jassy, Bezos, himself, and a few others for coming up with the idea that would evolve into EC2, S3, and RDS; [33] Jassy recalls the idea was the result of brainstorming for about a week with \"ten of the best technology minds and ten of the best product management minds\" on about ten different Internet applications and the most primitive building blocks required to build them.[20] Werner Vogels cites Amazon's desire to make the process of \"invent, launch, reinvent, relaunch, start over, rinse, repeat\" as fast as it could be leading them to break down organizational structures with \"two-pizza teams\"[c] and application structures with distributed systems;[d] and that these changes ultimately paved way for the formation of AWS[22] and its mission \"to expose all of the atomic-level pieces of the Amazon.com platform\".[36] According to Brewster Kahle, co-founder of Alexa Internet, which was acquired by Amazon in 1999, his start-up's compute infrastructure helped Amazon solve its big data problems and later informed the innovations that underpinned AWS.[37]\nJassy assembled a founding team of 57 employees from a mix of engineering and business backgrounds to kick-start these initiatives,[20][19] with a majority of the hires coming from outside the company;[20] Jeff Lawson, Twilio CEO,[38] Adam Selipsky, Tableau CEO,[39][40] Mikhail Seregine,[41] co-founder at Outschool[citation needed] among them.\nIn late 2003, the concept for compute,[e] which would later launch as EC2, was reformulated when Chris Pinkham and Benjamin Black presented a paper internally describing a vision for Amazon's retail computing infrastructure that was completely standardized, completely automated, and would rely extensively on web services for services such as storage and would draw on internal work already underway. Near the end of their paper, they mentioned the possibility of selling access to virtual servers as a service, proposing the company could generate revenue from the new infrastructure investment.[43][unreliable source?] Thereafter Pinkham, Willem van Biljon and lead developer Christopher Brown developed the Amazon EC2 service, with a team in Cape Town, South Africa.[44]\nIn November 2004, AWS launched its first infrastructure service for public usage: Simple Queue Service (SQS).[45]\nOn March 14, 2006, AWS launched Amazon S3 cloud storage[46] followed by EC2 in August 2006.[47] Andy Jassy, AWS founder and vice president in 2006, said at the time that Amazon S3 \"helps free developers from worrying about where they are going to store data, whether it will be safe and secure, if it will be available when they need it, the costs associated with server maintenance, or whether they have enough storage available. Amazon S3 enables developers to focus on innovating with data, rather than figuring out how to store it.\"[6] Pi Corporation, a startup Paul Maritz co-founded, was the first beta-user of EC2 outside of Amazon,[20] whilst Microsoft was among EC2's first enterprise customers.[48] Later that year, SmugMug, one of the early AWS adopters, attributed savings of around US$400,000 in storage costs to S3.[49] According to Vogels, S3 was built with 8 microservices when it launched in 2006, but had over 300 microservices by 2022.[50]\nIn September 2007, AWS announced its annual Start-up Challenge, a contest with prizes worth $100,000 for entrepreneurs and software developers based in the US using AWS services such as S3 and EC2 to build their businesses.[51] The first edition saw participation from Justin.tv,[52] which Amazon would later acquire in 2014.[53] Ooyala, an online media company,[54] was the eventual winner.[52]\nAdditional AWS services from this period include SimpleDB, Mechanical Turk, Elastic Block Store, Elastic Beanstalk, Relational Database Service, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, Simple Workflow, CloudFront, and Availability Zones.\nIn November 2010, it was reported that all of Amazon.com's retail sites had migrated to AWS.[55] Prior to 2012, AWS was considered a part of Amazon.com and so its revenue was not delineated in Amazon financial statements. In that year industry watchers for the first time estimated AWS revenue to be over $1.5 billion.[56]\nOn November 27, 2012, AWS hosted its first major annual conference, re:Invent with a focus on AWS' partners and ecosystem,[57] with over 150 sessions.[58] The three-day event was held in Las Vegas because of its relatively cheaper connectivity with locations across the United States and the rest of the world.[59] Andy Jassy and Werner Vogels presented keynotes, with Jeff Bezos joining Vogels for a fireside chat.[60] AWS opened early registrations at  US$1099 per head for their customers[58] from over 190 countries.[61] On stage with Andy Jassy at the event which saw around 6000 attendees, Reed Hastings, CEO at Netflix, announced plans to migrate 100% of Netflix's infrastructure to AWS.[60]\nTo support industry-wide training and skills standardization, AWS began offering a certification program for computer engineers, on April 30, 2013, to highlight expertise in cloud computing.[62] Later that year, in October, AWS launched Activate, a program for start-ups worldwide to leverage AWS credits, third-party integrations, and free access to AWS experts to help build their business.[63]\nIn 2014, AWS launched its partner network, AWS Partner Network (APN), which is focused on helping AWS-based companies grow and scale the success of their business with close collaboration and best practices.[64][65]\nIn January 2015, Amazon Web Services acquired Annapurna Labs, an Israel-based microelectronics company for a reported US$350\u2013370M.[66][67]\nIn April 2015, Amazon.com reported AWS was profitable, with sales of $1.57 billion in the first quarter of the year and $265 million of operating income. Founder Jeff Bezos described it as a fast-growing $5 billion business; analysts described it as \"surprisingly more profitable than forecast\".[68] In October, Amazon.com said in its Q3 earnings report that AWS's operating income was $521 million, with operating margins at 25 percent. AWS's 2015 Q3 revenue was $2.1 billion, a 78% increase from 2014's Q3 revenue of $1.17 billion.[69] 2015 Q4 revenue for the AWS segment increased 69.5% y/y to $2.4 billion with a 28.5% operating margin, giving AWS a $9.6 billion run rate. In 2015, Gartner estimated that AWS customers are deploying 10x more infrastructure on AWS than the combined adoption of the next 14 providers.[70]\nJames Hamilton, who leads AWS' compute, data center, and network design,[71] wrote a retrospective article in 2016 to highlight the ten-year history of the online service from 2006 to 2016. As an early fan and outspoken proponent of the technology, he joined the AWS engineering team in 2008.[72]\nIn 2016 Q1, revenue was $2.57 billion with net income of $604 million, a 64% increase over 2015 Q1 that resulted in AWS being more profitable than Amazon's North American retail business for the first time.[73] Jassy was thereafter promoted to CEO of the division.[74] Around the same time, Amazon experienced a 42% rise in stock value as a result of increased earnings, of which AWS contributed 56% to corporate profits.[75]\nAWS had $17.46 billion in annual revenue in 2017.[76] By end of 2020, the number had grown to $46 billion.[3] Reflecting the success of AWS, Jassy's annual compensation in 2017 hit nearly $36 million.[77]\nIn January 2018, Amazon launched an autoscaling service on AWS.[78][79]\nIn November 2018, AWS announced customized ARM cores for use in its servers.[80] Also in November 2018, AWS is developing ground stations to communicate with customer's satellites.[81]\nIn 2019, AWS reported 37% yearly growth and accounted for 12% of Amazon's revenue (up from 11% in 2018).[82]\nIn April 2021, AWS reported 32% yearly growth and accounted for 32% of $41.8 billion cloud market in Q1 2021.[83]\nIn January 2022, AWS joined the MACH Alliance as an Enabler member.[84]\nIn June 2022, it was reported that in 2019 Capital One had not secured their AWS resources properly, and was subject to a data breach by a former AWS employee, Paige Thompson (It is important to note this was not an issue with AWS security, but rather how Capital One had used AWS). The employee was convicted of hacking into the company\u2019s cloud servers to steal customer data and use computer power to mine cryptocurrency. The ex-employee was able to download the personal information of more than 100 million Capital One customers.[85]\nIn June 2022, AWS announced they had launched the AWS snow cone a small, rugged, secure  edge computing device to the International Space Station on the Axiom Mission 1. The device had to be run through rigorous testing including vacuum, vibration, acoustic,  and thermal. The device did not need radiation hardening because it was being used in the shielded ISS environment.[86]\nIn June 2022, Amazon announced and displayed a preview of their latest AI tools for programmers called CodeWhisperer. While currently only available to people who received an invitation though the AWS IDE Toolkit, CodeWhisperer is an IDE plugin that will examine the users code and comments and present users with syntactically correct suggestions. The Suggestions will be based on coding style and variable names and are not just snippets. Set to be free for the review period, the company will be charging for the product on a subscription bases upon full release.[87]\nNotable customers include NASA,[93] the Obama presidential campaign of 2012,[94] and Netflix.[95]\nIn 2019, it was reported that more than 80% of Germany's listed DAX companies use AWS.[96]\nIn August 2019, the U.S. Navy said it moved 72,000 users from six commands to an AWS cloud system as a first step toward pushing all of its data and analytics onto the cloud.[97]\nIn 2021, DISH Network announced they will develop and launch its 5G network on AWS.[98]\nIn October 2021, it was reported that spy agencies and government departments in the UK such as GCHQ, MI5, MI6, and the Ministry of Defence, have contracted AWS to host their classified materials.[99]\nMultiple financial services firms have shifted to AWS in some form in recent years.[100] [101] [102][103][104]\nAs of January\u00a02023[update], AWS has distinct operations in 31 geographical \"regions\":[9] 7 in North America, 1 in South America, 8 in Europe, 2 in the Middle East, 1 in Africa and 12 in Asia Pacific.\nEach region is wholly contained within a single country and all of its data and services stay within the designated region.[8] Each region has multiple \"Availability Zones\",[115] which consist of one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking, and connectivity, housed in separate facilities. Availability Zones do not automatically provide additional scalability or redundancy within a region, since they are intentionally isolated from each other to prevent outages from spreading between Zones. Several services can operate across Availability Zones (e.g., S3, DynamoDB) while others can be configured to replicate across Zones to spread demand and avoid downtime from failures.\nAs of December 2014, Amazon Web Services operated an estimated 1.4 million servers across 11 regions and 28 availability zones.[116] The global network of AWS Edge locations consists of over 300 points of presence worldwide, including locations in North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa, and South America.[117]\nAs of January\u00a02023[update], AWS has announced the planned launch of four additional regions in Canada (Calgary), Israel, New Zealand, and Thailand.[9] In mid March 2023, Amazon Web Services signed a cooperation agreement with the New Zealand Government to build large data centers in New Zealand.[118]\nIn 2014, AWS claimed its aim was to achieve 100% renewable energy usage in the future.[119]  In the United States, AWS's partnerships with renewable energy providers include Community Energy of Virginia, to support the US East region;[120] Pattern Development, in January 2015, to construct and operate Amazon Wind Farm Fowler Ridge;[121] Iberdrola Renewables, LLC, in July 2015, to construct and operate Amazon Wind Farm US East; EDP Renewables North America, in November 2015, to construct and operate Amazon Wind Farm US Central;[122] and  Tesla Motors, to apply battery storage technology to address power needs in the US West (Northern California) region.[120]\nAWS also has \"pop-up lofts\" in different locations around the world.[123] These market AWS to entrepreneurs and startups in different tech industries in a physical location. Visitors can work or relax inside the loft, or learn more about what they can do with AWS. In June 2014, AWS opened their first temporary pop-up loft in San Francisco.[124] In May 2015 they expanded to New York City,[125][126] and in September 2015 expanded to Berlin.[127] AWS opened its fourth location, in Tel Aviv from March 1, 2016, to March 22, 2016.[128] A pop-up loft was open in London from September 10 to October 29, 2015.[129] The pop-up lofts in New York[130] and San Francisco[131] are indefinitely closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic while Tokyo has remained open in a limited capacity.[132]\nIn 2017, AWS launched AWS re/Start in the United Kingdom to help young adults and military veterans retrain in technology-related skills.  In partnership with the Prince's Trust and the Ministry of Defence (MoD), AWS will help to provide re-training opportunities for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds and former military personnel.  AWS is working alongside a number of partner companies including Cloudreach, Sage Group, EDF Energy, and Tesco Bank.[133]\nIn April 2022, AWS announced the organization has committed more than $30 million over three years to early-stage start-ups led by Black, Latino, LGBTQIA+, and Women founders as part of its AWS impact Accelerator. The Initiative offers qualifying start-ups up to $225,000 in cash, credits, extensive training, mentoring, technical guidance and includes up to $100,000 in AWS service credits.[134]\nIn 2016, Greenpeace assessed major tech companies\u2014including cloud services providers like AWS, Microsoft, Oracle, Google, IBM, Salesforce.com and Rackspace\u2014based on their level of \"clean energy\" usage. Greenpeace evaluated companies on their mix of renewable-energy sources; transparency; renewable-energy commitment and policies; energy efficiency and greenhouse-gas mitigation; renewable-energy procurement; and advocacy. The group gave AWS an overall \"C\" grade. Greenpeace credited AWS for its advances toward greener computing in recent years, its plans to launch multiple wind and solar farms across the United States. The organization stated that Amazon is opaque about its carbon footprint.[135]\nIn January 2021, AWS joined an industry pledge to achieve climate neutrality of data centers by 2030, the Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact.[136]\nUS Department of Homeland Security has employed the software ATLAS, which runs on Amazon Cloud. It scanned more than 16.5 million of records of naturalized Americans and flagged approximately 124,000 of them for manual analysis and review by USCIS officers regarding denaturalization.[137][138] Some of the scanned data came from Terrorist Screening Database and National Crime Information Center. The algorithm and the criteria for the algorithm were secret. Amazon faced protests from its own employees and activists for the anti-migrant collaboration with authorities.[139]", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_web_services#cite_note-net1-65",

Wikipedia": {"text": "A distributed system is a system whose components are located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages to one another.[1][2] Distributed computing is a field of computer science that studies distributed systems.\nThe components of a distributed system interact with one another in order to achieve a common goal. Three significant challenges of distributed systems are: maintaining concurrency of components, overcoming the lack of a global clock, and managing the independent failure of components.[1] When a component of one system fails, the entire system does not fail.[3] Examples of distributed systems vary from SOA-based systems to massively multiplayer online games to peer-to-peer applications.\nA computer program that runs within a distributed system is called  a distributed program,[4] and distributed programming is the process of writing such programs.[5] There are many different types of implementations for the message passing mechanism, including pure HTTP, RPC-like connectors and message queues.[6]\nDistributed computing also refers to the use of distributed systems to solve computational problems. In distributed computing, a problem is divided into many tasks, each of which is solved by one or more computers,[7] which communicate with each other via message passing.[8]\nThe word distributed in terms such as \"distributed system\", \"distributed programming\", and \"distributed algorithm\" originally referred to computer networks where individual computers were physically distributed within some geographical area.[9] The terms are nowadays used in a much wider sense, even referring to autonomous processes that run on the same physical computer and interact with each other by message passing.[8]\nWhile there is no single definition of a distributed system,[10] the following defining properties are commonly used as:\nA distributed system may have a common goal, such as solving a large computational problem;[13] the user then perceives the collection of autonomous processors as a unit. Alternatively, each computer may have its own user with individual needs, and the purpose of the distributed system is to coordinate the use of shared resources or provide communication services to the users.[14]\nOther typical properties of distributed systems include the following:\nDistributed systems are groups of networked computers which share a common goal for their work.\nThe terms \"concurrent computing\", \"parallel computing\", and \"distributed computing\" have much overlap, and no clear distinction exists between them.[18] The same system may be characterized both as \"parallel\" and \"distributed\"; the processors in a typical distributed system run concurrently in parallel.[19] Parallel computing may be seen as a particular tightly coupled form of distributed computing,[20] and distributed computing may be seen as a loosely coupled form of parallel computing.[10] Nevertheless, it is possible to roughly classify concurrent systems as \"parallel\" or \"distributed\" using the following criteria:\nThe figure on the right illustrates the difference between distributed and parallel systems. Figure (a) is a schematic view of a typical distributed system; the system is represented as a network topology in which each node is a computer and each line connecting the nodes is a communication link. Figure (b) shows the same distributed system in more detail: each computer has its own local memory, and information can be exchanged only by passing messages from one node to another by using the available communication links. Figure (c) shows a parallel system in which each processor has a direct access to a shared memory.\nThe situation is further complicated by the traditional uses of the terms parallel and distributed algorithm that do not quite match the above definitions of parallel and distributed systems (see below for more detailed discussion). Nevertheless, as a rule of thumb, high-performance parallel computation in a shared-memory multiprocessor uses parallel algorithms while the coordination of a large-scale distributed system uses distributed algorithms.[23]\nThe use of concurrent processes which communicate through message-passing has its roots in operating system architectures studied in the 1960s.[24] The first widespread distributed systems were local-area networks such as Ethernet, which was invented in the 1970s.[25]\nARPANET, one of the predecessors of the Internet, was introduced in the late 1960s, and ARPANET e-mail was invented in the early 1970s. E-mail became the most successful application of ARPANET,[26] and it is probably the earliest example of a large-scale distributed application. In addition to ARPANET (and its successor, the global Internet), other early worldwide computer networks included Usenet and FidoNet from the 1980s, both of which were used to support distributed discussion systems.[27]\nThe study of distributed computing became its own branch of computer science in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The first conference in the field, Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing (PODC), dates back to 1982, and its counterpart International Symposium on Distributed Computing (DISC) was first held in Ottawa in 1985 as the International Workshop on Distributed Algorithms on Graphs.[28]\nVarious hardware and software architectures are used for distributed computing. At a lower level, it is necessary to interconnect multiple CPUs with some sort of network, regardless of whether that network is printed onto a circuit board or made up of loosely coupled devices and cables. At a higher level, it is necessary to interconnect processes running on those CPUs with some sort of communication system.[29]\nDistributed programming typically falls into one of several basic architectures: client\u2013server, three-tier, n-tier, or peer-to-peer; or categories: loose coupling, or tight coupling.[30]\nAnother basic aspect of distributed computing architecture is the method of communicating and coordinating work among concurrent processes. Through various message passing protocols, processes may communicate directly with one another, typically in a master/slave relationship. Alternatively, a \"database-centric\" architecture can enable distributed computing to be done without any form of direct inter-process communication, by utilizing a shared database.[33] Database-centric architecture in particular provides relational processing analytics in a schematic architecture allowing for live environment relay. This enables distributed computing functions both within and beyond the parameters of a networked database.[34]\nReasons for using distributed systems and distributed computing may include:\nExamples of distributed systems and applications of distributed computing include the following:[36]\nMany tasks that we would like to automate by using a computer are of question\u2013answer type: we would like to ask a question and the computer should produce an answer. In theoretical computer science, such tasks are called computational problems. Formally, a computational problem consists of instances together with a solution for each instance. Instances are questions that we can ask, and solutions are desired answers to these questions.\nTheoretical computer science seeks to understand which computational problems can be solved by using a computer (computability theory) and how efficiently (computational complexity theory). Traditionally, it is said that a problem can be solved by using a computer if we can design an algorithm that produces a correct solution for any given instance. Such an algorithm can be implemented as a computer program that runs on a general-purpose computer: the program reads a problem instance from input, performs some computation, and produces the solution as output. Formalisms such as random-access machines or universal Turing machines can be used as abstract models of a sequential general-purpose computer executing such an algorithm.[38][39]\nThe field of concurrent and distributed computing studies similar questions in the case of either multiple computers, or a computer that executes a network of interacting processes: which computational problems can be solved in such a network and how efficiently? However, it is not at all obvious what is meant by \"solving a problem\" in the case of a concurrent or distributed system: for example, what is the task of the algorithm designer, and what is the concurrent or distributed equivalent of a sequential general-purpose computer?[citation needed]\nThe discussion below focuses on the case of multiple computers, although many of the issues are the same for concurrent processes running on a single computer.\nThree viewpoints are commonly used:\nIn the case of distributed algorithms, computational problems are typically related to graphs. Often the graph that describes the structure of the computer network is the problem instance. This is illustrated in the following example.[citation needed]\nConsider the computational problem of finding a coloring of a given graph G. Different fields might take the following approaches:\nWhile the field of parallel algorithms has a different focus than the field of distributed algorithms, there is much interaction between the two fields. For example, the Cole\u2013Vishkin algorithm for graph coloring[44] was originally presented as a parallel algorithm, but the same technique can also be used directly as a distributed algorithm.\nMoreover, a parallel algorithm can be implemented either in a parallel system (using shared memory) or in a distributed system (using message passing).[45] The traditional boundary between parallel and distributed algorithms (choose a suitable network vs. run in any given network) does not lie in the same place as the boundary between parallel and distributed systems (shared memory vs. message passing).\nIn parallel algorithms, yet another resource in addition to time and space is the number of computers. Indeed, often there is a trade-off between the running time and the number of computers: the problem can be solved faster if there are more computers running in parallel (see speedup). If a decision problem can be solved in polylogarithmic time by using a polynomial number of processors, then the problem is said to be in the class NC.[46] The class NC can be defined equally well by using the PRAM formalism or Boolean circuits\u2014PRAM machines can simulate Boolean circuits efficiently and vice versa.[47]\nIn the analysis of distributed algorithms, more attention is usually paid on communication operations than computational steps. Perhaps the simplest model of distributed computing is a synchronous system where all nodes operate in a lockstep fashion. This model is commonly known as the LOCAL model. During each communication round, all nodes in parallel (1)\u00a0receive the latest messages from their neighbours, (2)\u00a0perform arbitrary local computation, and (3)\u00a0send new messages to their neighbors. In such systems, a central complexity measure is the number of synchronous communication rounds required to complete the task.[48]\nThis complexity measure is closely related to the diameter of the network. Let D be the diameter of the network. On the one hand, any computable problem can be solved trivially in a synchronous distributed system in approximately 2D communication rounds: simply gather all information in one location (D rounds), solve the problem, and inform each node about the solution (D rounds).\nOn the other hand, if the running time of the algorithm is much smaller than D communication rounds, then the nodes in the network must produce their output without having the possibility to obtain information about distant parts of the network. In other words, the nodes must make globally consistent decisions based on information that is available in their local D-neighbourhood. Many distributed algorithms are known with the running time much smaller than D rounds, and understanding which problems can be solved by such algorithms is one of the central research questions of the field.[49] Typically an algorithm which solves a problem in polylogarithmic time in the network size is considered efficient in this model.\nAnother commonly used measure is the total number of bits transmitted in the network (cf. communication complexity).[50] The features of this concept are typically captured with the CONGEST(B) model, which is similarly defined as the LOCAL model, but where single messages can only contain B bits.\nTraditional computational problems take the perspective that the user asks a question, a computer (or a distributed system) processes the question, then produces an answer and stops. However, there are also problems where the system is required not to stop, including the dining philosophers problem and other similar mutual exclusion problems. In these problems, the distributed system is supposed to continuously coordinate the use of shared resources so that no conflicts or deadlocks occur.\nThere are also fundamental challenges that are unique to distributed computing, for example those related to fault-tolerance. Examples of related problems include consensus problems,[51] Byzantine fault tolerance,[52] and self-stabilisation.[53]\nMuch research is also focused on understanding the asynchronous nature of distributed systems:\nCoordinator election (or leader election) is the process of designating a single process as the organizer of some task distributed among several computers (nodes). Before the task is begun, all network nodes are either unaware which node will serve as the \"coordinator\" (or leader) of the task, or unable to communicate with the current coordinator. After a coordinator election algorithm has been run, however, each node throughout the network recognizes a particular, unique node as the task coordinator.[57]\nThe network nodes communicate among themselves in order to decide which of them will get into the \"coordinator\" state. For that, they need some method in order to break the symmetry among them. For example, if each node has unique and comparable identities, then the nodes can compare their identities, and decide that the node with the highest identity is the coordinator.[57]\nThe definition of this problem is often attributed to LeLann, who formalized it as a method to create a new token in a token ring network in which the token has been lost.[58]\nCoordinator election algorithms are designed to be economical in terms of total bytes transmitted, and time. The algorithm suggested by Gallager, Humblet, and Spira [59] for general undirected graphs has had a strong impact on the design of distributed algorithms in general, and won the Dijkstra Prize for an influential paper in distributed computing.\nMany other algorithms were suggested for different kinds of network graphs, such as undirected rings, unidirectional rings, complete graphs, grids, directed Euler graphs, and others. A general method that decouples the issue of the graph family from the design of the coordinator election algorithm was suggested by Korach, Kutten, and Moran.[60]\nIn order to perform coordination, distributed systems employ the concept of coordinators. The coordinator election problem is to choose a process from among a group of processes on different processors in a distributed system to act as the central coordinator. Several central coordinator election algorithms exist.[61]\nSo far the focus has been on designing a distributed system that solves a given problem. A complementary research problem is studying the properties of a given distributed system.[62][63]\nThe halting problem is an analogous example from the field of centralised computation: we are given a computer program and the task is to decide whether it halts or runs forever. The halting problem is undecidable in the general case, and naturally understanding the behaviour of a computer network is at least as hard as understanding the behaviour of one computer.[64]\nHowever, there are many interesting special cases that are decidable. In particular, it is possible to reason about the behaviour of a network of finite-state machines. One example is telling whether a given network of interacting (asynchronous and non-deterministic) finite-state machines can reach a deadlock. This problem is PSPACE-complete,[65] i.e., it is decidable, but not likely that there is an efficient (centralised, parallel or distributed) algorithm that solves the problem in the case of large networks.", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing", " https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amazon_web_services#bodyContent", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page",

{"text": "Big data primarily refers to data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software. Data with many entries (rows) offer greater statistical power, while data with higher complexity (more attributes or columns) may lead to a higher false discovery rate.[2] Though used sometimes loosely partly because of a lack of formal definition, the interpretation that seems to best describe big data is the one associated with large body of information that we could not comprehend when used only in smaller amounts.[3]\nBig data analysis challenges include capturing data, data storage, data analysis, search, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying, updating, information privacy, and data source. Big data was originally associated with three key concepts: volume, variety, and velocity.[4] The analysis of big data presents challenges in sampling, and thus previously allowing for only observations and sampling. Thus a fourth concept, veracity, refers to the quality or insightfulness of the data. Without sufficient investment in expertise for big data veracity, then the volume and variety of data can produce costs and risks that exceed an organization's capacity to create and capture value from big data.[5]\nCurrent usage of the term big data tends to refer to the use of predictive analytics, user behavior analytics, or certain other advanced data analytics methods that extract value from big data, and seldom to a particular size of data set. \"There is little doubt that the quantities of data now available are indeed large, but that's not the most relevant characteristic of this new data ecosystem.\"[6]\nAnalysis of data sets can find new correlations to \"spot business trends, prevent diseases, combat crime and so on\".[7] Scientists, business executives, medical practitioners, advertising and governments alike regularly meet difficulties with large data-sets in areas including Internet searches, fintech, healthcare analytics, geographic information systems, urban informatics, and business informatics. Scientists encounter limitations in e-Science work, including meteorology, genomics,[8] connectomics, complex physics simulations, biology, and environmental research.[9]\nThe size and number of available data sets have grown rapidly as data is collected by devices such as mobile devices, cheap and numerous information-sensing Internet of things devices, aerial (remote sensing), software logs, cameras, microphones, radio-frequency identification (RFID) readers and wireless sensor networks.[10][11] The world's technological per-capita capacity to store information has roughly doubled every 40 months since the 1980s;[12] as of 2012[update], every day 2.5 exabytes (2.5\u00d7260 bytes) of data are generated.[13] Based on an IDC report prediction, the global data volume was predicted to grow exponentially from 4.4 zettabytes to 44 zettabytes between 2013 and 2020. By 2025, IDC predicts there will be 163 zettabytes of data.[14] According to IDC, global spending on big data and business analytics (BDA) solutions is estimated to reach $215.7 billion in 2021.[15][16] While Statista report, the global big data market is forecasted to grow to $103 billion by 2027.[17] In 2011 McKinsey & Company reported, if US healthcare were to use big data creatively and effectively to drive efficiency and quality, the sector could create more than $300 billion in value every year.[18] In the developed economies of Europe, government administrators could save more than \u20ac100 billion ($149 billion) in operational efficiency improvements alone by using big data.[18] And users of services enabled by personal-location data could capture $600 billion in consumer surplus.[18] One question for large enterprises is determining who should own big-data initiatives that affect the entire organization.[19]\nRelational database management systems and desktop statistical software packages used to visualize data often have difficulty processing and analyzing big data. The processing and analysis of big data may require \"massively parallel software running on tens, hundreds, or even thousands of servers\".[20] What qualifies as \"big data\" varies depending on the capabilities of those analyzing it and their tools. Furthermore, expanding capabilities make big data a moving target. \"For some organizations, facing hundreds of gigabytes of data for the first time may trigger a need to reconsider data management options. For others, it may take tens or hundreds of terabytes before data size becomes a significant consideration.\"[21]\nThe term big data has been in use since the 1990s, with some giving credit to John Mashey for popularizing the term.[22][23]\nBig data usually includes data sets with sizes beyond the ability of commonly used software tools to capture, curate, manage, and process data within a tolerable elapsed time.[24] Big data philosophy encompasses unstructured, semi-structured and structured data; however, the main focus is on unstructured data.[25] Big data \"size\" is a constantly moving target; as of 2012[update] ranging from a few dozen terabytes to many zettabytes of data.[26]\nBig data requires a set of techniques and technologies with new forms of integration to reveal insights from data-sets that are diverse, complex, and of a massive scale.[27]\n\"Variety\", \"veracity\", and various other \"Vs\" are added by some organizations to describe it, a revision challenged by some industry authorities.[28] The Vs of big data were often referred to as the \"three Vs\", \"four Vs\", and \"five Vs\". They represented the qualities of big data in volume, variety, velocity, veracity, and value.[4] Variability is often included as an additional quality of big data.\nA 2018 definition states \"Big data is where parallel computing tools are needed to handle data\", and notes, \"This represents a distinct and clearly defined change in the computer science used, via parallel programming theories, and losses of some of the guarantees and capabilities made by Codd's relational model.\"[29]\nIn a comparative study of big datasets, Kitchin and McArdle found that none of the commonly considered characteristics of big data appear consistently across all of the analyzed cases.[30] For this reason, other studies identified the redefinition of power dynamics in knowledge discovery as the defining trait.[31] Instead of focusing on intrinsic characteristics of big data, this alternative perspective pushes forward a relational understanding of the object claiming that what matters is the way in which data is collected, stored, made available and analyzed.\nThe growing maturity of the concept more starkly delineates the difference between \"big data\" and \"business intelligence\":[32]\nBig data can be described by the following characteristics:\nOther possible characteristics of big data are:[41]\nBig data repositories have existed in many forms, often built by corporations with a special need. Commercial vendors historically offered parallel database management systems for big data beginning in the 1990s. For many years, WinterCorp published the largest database report.[42][promotional source?]\nTeradata Corporation in 1984 marketed the parallel processing DBC 1012 system. Teradata systems were the first to store and analyze 1 terabyte of data in 1992. Hard disk drives were 2.5 GB in 1991 so the definition of big data continuously evolves. Teradata installed the first petabyte class RDBMS based system in 2007. As of 2017[update], there are a few dozen petabyte class Teradata relational databases installed, the largest of which exceeds 50 PB. Systems up until 2008 were 100% structured relational data. Since then, Teradata has added unstructured data types including XML, JSON, and Avro.\nIn 2000, Seisint Inc. (now LexisNexis Risk Solutions) developed a C++-based distributed platform for data processing and querying known as the HPCC Systems platform. This system automatically partitions, distributes, stores and delivers structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data across multiple commodity servers. Users can write data processing pipelines and queries in a declarative dataflow programming language called ECL. Data analysts working in ECL are not required to define data schemas upfront and can rather focus on the particular problem at hand, reshaping data in the best possible manner as they develop the solution. In 2004, LexisNexis acquired Seisint Inc.[43] and their high-speed parallel processing platform and successfully used this platform to integrate the data systems of Choicepoint Inc. when they acquired that company in 2008.[44] In 2011, the HPCC systems platform was open-sourced under the Apache v2.0 License.\nCERN and other physics experiments have collected big data sets for many decades, usually analyzed via high-throughput computing rather than the map-reduce architectures usually meant by the current \"big data\" movement.\nIn 2004, Google published a paper on a process called MapReduce that uses a similar architecture. The MapReduce concept provides a parallel processing model, and an associated implementation was released to process huge amounts of data. With MapReduce, queries are split and distributed across parallel nodes and processed in parallel (the \"map\" step). The results are then gathered and delivered (the \"reduce\" step). The framework was very successful,[45] so others wanted to replicate the algorithm. Therefore, an implementation of the MapReduce framework was adopted by an Apache open-source project named \"Hadoop\".[46] Apache Spark was developed in 2012 in response to limitations in the MapReduce paradigm, as it adds in-memory processing and the ability to set up many operations (not just map followed by reducing).\nMIKE2.0 is an open approach to information management that acknowledges the need for revisions due to big data implications identified in an article titled \"Big Data Solution Offering\".[47] The methodology addresses handling big data in terms of useful permutations of data sources, complexity in interrelationships, and difficulty in deleting (or modifying) individual records.[48]\nStudies in 2012 showed that a multiple-layer architecture was one option to address the issues that big data presents. A distributed parallel architecture distributes data across multiple servers; these parallel execution environments can dramatically improve data processing speeds. This type of architecture inserts data into a parallel DBMS, which implements the use of MapReduce and Hadoop frameworks. This type of framework looks to make the processing power transparent to the end-user by using a front-end application server.[49]\nThe data lake allows an organization to shift its focus from centralized control to a shared model to respond to the changing dynamics of information management. This enables quick segregation of data into the data lake, thereby reducing the overhead time.[50][51]\nA 2011 McKinsey Global Institute report characterizes the main components and ecosystem of big data as follows:[52]\nMultidimensional big data can also be represented as OLAP data cubes or, mathematically, tensors. Array database systems have set out to provide storage and high-level query support on this data type.\nAdditional technologies being applied to big data include efficient tensor-based computation,[53] such as multilinear subspace learning,[54] massively parallel-processing (MPP) databases, search-based applications, data mining,[55] distributed file systems, distributed cache (e.g., burst buffer and Memcached), distributed databases, cloud and HPC-based infrastructure (applications, storage and computing resources),[56] and the Internet.[citation needed] Although, many approaches and technologies have been developed, it still remains difficult to carry out machine learning with big data.[57]\nSome MPP relational databases have the ability to store and manage petabytes of data. Implicit is the ability to load, monitor, back up, and optimize the use of the large data tables in the RDBMS.[58][promotional source?]\nDARPA's Topological Data Analysis program seeks the fundamental structure of massive data sets and in 2008 the technology went public with the launch of a company called \"Ayasdi\".[59][third-party source needed]\nThe practitioners of big data analytics processes are generally hostile to slower shared storage,[60] preferring direct-attached storage (DAS) in its various forms from solid state drive (SSD) to high capacity SATA disk buried inside parallel processing nodes. The perception of shared storage architectures\u2014storage area network (SAN) and network-attached storage (NAS)\u2014 is that they are relatively slow, complex, and expensive. These qualities are not consistent with big data analytics systems that thrive on system performance, commodity infrastructure, and low cost.\nReal or near-real-time information delivery is one of the defining characteristics of big data analytics. Latency is therefore avoided whenever and wherever possible. Data in direct-attached memory or disk is good\u2014data on memory or disk at the other end of an FC SAN connection is not. The cost of an SAN at the scale needed for analytics applications is much higher than other storage techniques.\nBig data has increased the demand of information management specialists so much so that Software AG, Oracle Corporation, IBM, Microsoft, SAP, EMC, HP, and Dell have spent more than $15\u00a0billion on software firms specializing in data management and analytics. In 2010, this industry was worth more than $100\u00a0billion and was growing at almost 10\u00a0percent a year, about twice as fast as the software business as a whole.[7]\nDeveloped economies increasingly use data-intensive technologies. There are 4.6\u00a0billion mobile-phone subscriptions worldwide, and between 1\u00a0billion and 2\u00a0billion people accessing the internet.[7] Between 1990 and 2005, more than 1\u00a0billion people worldwide entered the middle class, which means more people became more literate, which in turn led to information growth. The world's effective capacity to exchange information through telecommunication networks was 281 petabytes in 1986, 471 petabytes in 1993, 2.2 exabytes in 2000, 65 exabytes in 2007[12] and predictions put the amount of internet traffic at 667 exabytes annually by 2014.[7] According to one estimate, one-third of the globally stored information is in the form of alphanumeric text and still image data,[61] which is the format most useful for most big data applications. This also shows the potential of yet unused data (i.e. in the form of video and audio content).\nWhile many vendors offer off-the-shelf products for big data, experts promote the development of in-house custom-tailored systems if the company has sufficient technical capabilities.[62]\nThe use and adoption of big data within governmental processes allows efficiencies in terms of cost, productivity, and innovation,[63] but does not come without its flaws. Data analysis often requires multiple parts of government (central and local) to work in collaboration and create new and innovative processes to deliver the desired outcome. A common government organization that makes use of big data is the National Security Administration (NSA), which monitors the activities of the Internet constantly in search for potential patterns of suspicious or illegal activities their system may pick up.\nCivil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) collects all certificates status from birth to death. CRVS is a source of big data for governments.\nResearch on the effective usage of information and communication technologies for development (also known as \"ICT4D\") suggests that big data technology can make important contributions but also present unique challenges to international development.[64][65] Advancements in big data analysis offer cost-effective opportunities to improve decision-making in critical development areas such as health care, employment, economic productivity, crime, security, and natural disaster and resource management.[66][67][68] Additionally, user-generated data offers new opportunities to give the unheard a voice.[69] However, longstanding challenges for developing regions such as inadequate technological infrastructure and economic and human resource scarcity exacerbate existing concerns with big data such as privacy, imperfect methodology, and interoperability issues.[66] The challenge of \"big data for development\"[66] is currently evolving toward the application of this data through machine learning, known as \"artificial intelligence for development (AI4D).[70]\nA major practical application of big data for development has been \"fighting poverty with data\".[71] In 2015, Blumenstock and colleagues estimated predicted poverty and wealth from mobile phone metadata [72] and in 2016 Jean and colleagues combined satellite imagery and machine learning to predict poverty.[73] Using digital trace data to study the labor market and the digital economy in Latin America, Hilbert and colleagues [74][75] argue that digital trace data has several benefits such as:\nAt the same time, working with digital trace data instead of traditional survey data does not eliminate the traditional challenges involved when working in the field of international quantitative analysis. Priorities change, but the basic discussions remain the same. Among the main challenges are:\nBig Data is being rapidly adopted in Finance to 1) speed up processing and 2) deliver better, more informed inferences, both internally and to the clients of the financial institutions[77].. The financial applications of Big Data range from investing decisions and trading (processing volumes of available price data, limit order books, economic data and more, all at the same time), portfolio management (optimizing over an increasingly large array of financial instruments, potentially selected from different asset classes), risk management (credit rating based on extended information), and any other aspect where the data inputs are large.[78]\nBig data analytics was used in healthcare by providing personalized medicine and prescriptive analytics, clinical risk intervention and predictive analytics, waste and care variability reduction, automated external and internal reporting of patient data, standardized medical terms and patient registries.[79][80][81][82] Some areas of improvement are more aspirational than actually implemented. The level of data generated within healthcare systems is not trivial. With the added adoption of mHealth, eHealth and wearable technologies the volume of data will continue to increase. This includes electronic health record data, imaging data, patient generated data, sensor data, and other forms of difficult to process data. There is now an even greater need for such environments to pay greater attention to data and information quality.[83] \"Big data very often means 'dirty data' and the fraction of data inaccuracies increases with data volume growth.\" Human inspection at the big data scale is impossible and there is a desperate need in health service for intelligent tools for accuracy and believability control and handling of information missed.[84] While extensive information in healthcare is now electronic, it fits under the big data umbrella as most is unstructured and difficult to use.[85] The use of big data in healthcare has raised significant ethical challenges ranging from risks for individual rights, privacy and autonomy, to transparency and trust.[86]\nBig data in health research is particularly promising in terms of exploratory biomedical research, as data-driven analysis can move forward more quickly than hypothesis-driven research.[87] Then, trends seen in data analysis can be tested in traditional, hypothesis-driven follow up biological research and eventually clinical research.\nA related application sub-area, that heavily relies on big data, within the healthcare field is that of computer-aided diagnosis in medicine.\n[88] For instance, for epilepsy monitoring it is customary to create 5 to 10 GB of data daily.\n[89] Similarly, a single uncompressed image of breast tomosynthesis averages 450 MB of data.\n[90]\nThese are just a few of the many examples where computer-aided diagnosis uses big data. For this reason, big data has been recognized as one of the seven key challenges that computer-aided diagnosis systems need to overcome in order to reach the next level of performance.\n[91]\nA McKinsey Global Institute study found a shortage of 1.5 million highly trained data professionals and managers[52] and a number of universities[92][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] including University of Tennessee and UC Berkeley, have created masters programs to meet this demand. Private boot camps have also developed programs to meet that demand, including free programs like The Data Incubator or paid programs like General Assembly.[93] In the specific field of marketing, one of the problems stressed by Wedel and Kannan[94] is that marketing has several sub domains (e.g., advertising, promotions,\nproduct development, branding) that all use different types of data.\nTo understand how the media uses big data, it is first necessary to provide some context into the mechanism used for media process. It has been suggested by Nick Couldry and Joseph Turow that practitioners in media and advertising approach big data as many actionable points of information about millions of individuals. The industry appears to be moving away from the traditional approach of using specific media environments such as newspapers, magazines, or television shows and instead taps into consumers with technologies that reach targeted people at optimal times in optimal locations. The ultimate aim is to serve or convey, a message or content that is (statistically speaking) in line with the consumer's mindset. For example, publishing environments are increasingly tailoring messages (advertisements) and content (articles) to appeal to consumers that have been exclusively gleaned through various data-mining activities.[95]\nChannel 4, the British public-service television broadcaster, is a leader in the field of big data and data analysis.[97]\nHealth insurance providers are collecting data on social \"determinants of health\" such as food and TV consumption, marital status, clothing size, and purchasing habits, from which they make predictions on health costs, in order to spot health issues in their clients. It is controversial whether these predictions are currently being used for pricing.[98]\nBig data and the IoT work in conjunction. Data extracted from IoT devices provides a mapping of device inter-connectivity. Such mappings have been used by the media industry, companies, and governments to more accurately target their audience and increase media efficiency. The IoT is also increasingly adopted as a means of gathering sensory data, and this sensory data has been used in medical,[99] manufacturing[100] and transportation[101] contexts.\nKevin Ashton, the digital innovation expert who is credited with coining the term,[102] defines the Internet of things in this quote: \"If we had computers that knew everything there was to know about things\u2014using data they gathered without any help from us\u2014we would be able to track and count everything, and greatly reduce waste, loss, and cost. We would know when things needed replacing, repairing, or recalling, and whether they were fresh or past their best.\"\nEspecially since 2015, big data has come to prominence within business operations as a tool to help employees work more efficiently and streamline the collection and distribution of information technology (IT). The use of big data to resolve IT and data collection issues within an enterprise is called IT operations analytics (ITOA).[103] By applying big data principles into the concepts of machine intelligence and deep computing, IT departments can predict potential issues and prevent them.[103] ITOA businesses offer platforms for systems management that bring data silos together and generate insights from the whole of the system rather than from isolated pockets of data.\nExamples of uses of big data in public services:\nBig data can be used to improve training and understanding competitors, using sport sensors. It is also possible to predict winners in a match using big data analytics.[143]\nFuture performance of players could be predicted as well. Thus, players' value and salary is determined by data collected throughout the season.[144]\nIn Formula One races, race cars with hundreds of sensors generate terabytes of data. These sensors collect data points from tire pressure to fuel burn efficiency.[145]\nBased on the data, engineers and data analysts decide whether adjustments should be made in order to win a race. Besides, using big data, race teams try to predict the time they will finish the race beforehand, based on simulations using data collected over the season.[146]\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, big data was raised as a way to minimise the impact of the disease. Significant applications of big data included minimising the spread of the virus, case identification and development of medical treatment.[152]\nGovernments used big data to track infected people to minimise spread. Early adopters included China, Taiwan, South Korea, and Israel.[153][154][155]\nEncrypted search and cluster formation in big data were demonstrated in March 2014 at the American Society of Engineering Education. Gautam Siwach engaged at Tackling the challenges of Big Data by MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and Amir Esmailpour at the UNH Research Group investigated the key features of big data as the formation of clusters and their interconnections. They focused on the security of big data and the orientation of the term towards the presence of different types of data in an encrypted form at cloud interface by providing the raw definitions and real-time examples within the technology. Moreover, they proposed an approach for identifying the encoding technique to advance towards an expedited search over encrypted text leading to the security enhancements in big data.[156]\nIn March 2012, The White House announced a national \"Big Data Initiative\" that consisted of six federal departments and agencies committing more than $200\u00a0million to big data research projects.[157]\nThe initiative included a National Science Foundation \"Expeditions in Computing\" grant of $10 million over five years to the AMPLab[158] at the University of California, Berkeley.[159] The AMPLab also received funds from DARPA, and over a dozen industrial sponsors and uses big data to attack a wide range of problems from predicting traffic congestion[160] to fighting cancer.[161]\nThe White House Big Data Initiative also included a commitment by the Department of Energy to provide $25 million in funding over five years to establish the Scalable Data Management, Analysis and Visualization (SDAV) Institute,[162] led by the Energy Department's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The SDAV Institute aims to bring together the expertise of six national laboratories and seven universities to develop new tools to help scientists manage and visualize data on the department's supercomputers.\nThe U.S. state of Massachusetts announced the Massachusetts Big Data Initiative in May 2012, which provides funding from the state government and private companies to a variety of research institutions.[163] The Massachusetts Institute of Technology hosts the Intel Science and Technology Center for Big Data in the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, combining government, corporate, and institutional funding and research efforts.[164]\nThe European Commission is funding the two-year-long Big Data Public Private Forum through their Seventh Framework Program to engage companies, academics and other stakeholders in discussing big data issues. The project aims to define a strategy in terms of research and innovation to guide supporting actions from the European Commission in the successful implementation of the big data economy. Outcomes of this project will be used as input for Horizon 2020, their next framework program.[165]\nThe British government announced in March 2014 the founding of the Alan Turing Institute, named after the computer pioneer and code-breaker, which will focus on new ways to collect and analyze large data sets.[166]\nAt the University of Waterloo Stratford Campus Canadian Open Data Experience (CODE) Inspiration Day, participants demonstrated how using data visualization can increase the understanding and appeal of big data sets and communicate their story to the world.[167]\nComputational social sciences\u00a0\u2013 Anyone can use application programming interfaces (APIs) provided by big data holders, such as Google and Twitter, to do research in the social and behavioral sciences.[168] Often these APIs are provided for free.[168] Tobias Preis et al. used Google Trends data to demonstrate that Internet users from countries with a higher per capita gross domestic products (GDPs) are more likely to search for information about the future than information about the past. The findings suggest there may be a link between online behaviors and real-world economic indicators.[169][170][171] The authors of the study examined Google queries logs made by ratio of the volume of searches for the coming year (2011) to the volume of searches for the previous year (2009), which they call the \"future orientation index\".[172] They compared the future orientation index to the per capita GDP of each country, and found a strong tendency for countries where Google users inquire more about the future to have a higher GDP.\nTobias Preis and his colleagues Helen Susannah Moat and H. Eugene Stanley introduced a method to identify online precursors for stock market moves, using trading strategies based on search volume data provided by Google Trends.[173] Their analysis of Google search volume for 98 terms of varying financial relevance, published in Scientific Reports,[174] suggests that increases in search volume for financially relevant search terms tend to precede large losses in financial markets.[175][176][177][178][179][180][181]\nBig data sets come with algorithmic challenges that previously did not exist. Hence, there is seen by some to be a need to fundamentally change the processing ways.[182]\nThe Workshops on Algorithms for Modern Massive Data Sets (MMDS) bring together computer scientists, statisticians, mathematicians, and data analysis practitioners to discuss algorithmic challenges of big data.[183] Regarding big data, such concepts of magnitude are relative. As it is stated \"If the past is of any guidance, then today's big data most likely will not be considered as such in the near future.\"[88]\nA research question that is asked about big data sets is whether it is necessary to look at the full data to draw certain conclusions about the properties of the data or if is a sample is good enough. The name big data itself contains a term related to size and this is an important characteristic of big data. But sampling enables the selection of right data points from within the larger data set to estimate the characteristics of the whole population. In manufacturing different types of sensory data such as acoustics, vibration, pressure, current, voltage, and controller data are available at short time intervals. To predict downtime it may not be necessary to look at all the data but a sample may be sufficient. Big data can be broken down by various data point categories such as demographic, psychographic, behavioral, and transactional data. With large sets of data points, marketers are able to create and use more customized segments of consumers for more strategic targeting.\nThere has been some work done in sampling algorithms for big data. A theoretical formulation for sampling Twitter data has been developed.[184]\nCritiques of the big data paradigm come in two flavors: those that question the implications of the approach itself, and those that question the way it is currently done.[185] One approach to this criticism is the field of critical data studies.\n\"A crucial problem is that we do not know much about the underlying empirical micro-processes that lead to the emergence of the[se] typical network characteristics of Big Data.\"[24] In their critique, Snijders, Matzat, and Reips point out that often very strong assumptions are made about mathematical properties that may not at all reflect what is really going on at the level of micro-processes. Mark Graham has leveled broad critiques at Chris Anderson's assertion that big data will spell the end of theory:[186] focusing in particular on the notion that big data must always be contextualized in their social, economic, and political contexts.[187] Even as companies invest eight- and nine-figure sums to derive insight from information streaming in from suppliers and customers, less than 40% of employees have sufficiently mature processes and skills to do so. To overcome this insight deficit, big data, no matter how comprehensive or well analyzed, must be complemented by \"big judgment\", according to an article in the Harvard Business Review.[188]\nMuch in the same line, it has been pointed out that the decisions based on the analysis of big data are inevitably \"informed by the world as it was in the past, or, at best, as it currently is\".[66] Fed by a large number of data on past experiences, algorithms can predict future development if the future is similar to the past.[189] If the system's dynamics of the future change (if it is not a stationary process), the past can say little about the future. In order to make predictions in changing environments, it would be necessary to have a thorough understanding of the systems dynamic, which requires theory.[189] As a response to this critique Alemany Oliver and Vayre suggest to use \"abductive reasoning as a first step in the research process in order to bring context to consumers' digital traces and make new theories emerge\".[190]\nAdditionally, it has been suggested to combine big data approaches with computer simulations, such as agent-based models[66] and complex systems. Agent-based models are increasingly getting better in predicting the outcome of social complexities of even unknown future scenarios through computer simulations that are based on a collection of mutually interdependent algorithms.[191][192] Finally, the use of multivariate methods that probe for the latent structure of the data, such as factor analysis and cluster analysis, have proven useful as analytic approaches that go well beyond the bi-variate approaches (e.g. contingency tables) typically employed with smaller data sets.\nIn health and biology, conventional scientific approaches are based on experimentation. For these approaches, the limiting factor is the relevant data that can confirm or refute the initial hypothesis.[193]\nA new postulate is accepted now in biosciences: the information provided by the data in huge volumes (omics) without prior hypothesis is complementary and sometimes necessary to conventional approaches based on experimentation.[194][195] In the massive approaches it is the formulation of a relevant hypothesis to explain the data that is the limiting factor.[196] The search logic is reversed and the limits of induction (\"Glory of Science and Philosophy scandal\", C. D. Broad, 1926) are to be considered.[citation needed]\nPrivacy advocates are concerned about the threat to privacy represented by increasing storage and integration of personally identifiable information; expert panels have released various policy recommendations to conform practice to expectations of privacy.[197] The misuse of big data in several cases by media, companies, and even the government has allowed for abolition of trust in almost every fundamental institution holding up society.[198]\nNayef Al-Rodhan argues that a new kind of social contract will be needed to protect individual liberties in the context of big data and giant corporations that own vast amounts of information, and that the use of big data should be monitored and better regulated at the national and international levels.[199] Barocas and Nissenbaum argue that one way of protecting individual users is by being informed about the types of information being collected, with whom it is shared, under what constraints and for what purposes.[200]\nThe \"V\" model of big data is concerning as it centers around computational scalability and lacks in a loss around the perceptibility and understandability of information. This led to the framework of cognitive big data, which characterizes big data applications according to:[201]\nLarge data sets have been analyzed by computing machines for well over a century, including the US census analytics performed by IBM's punch-card machines which computed statistics including means and variances of populations across the whole continent. In more recent decades, science experiments such as CERN have produced data on similar scales to current commercial \"big data\". However, science experiments have tended to analyze their data using specialized custom-built high-performance computing (super-computing) clusters and grids, rather than clouds of cheap commodity computers as in the current commercial wave, implying a difference in both culture and technology stack.\nUlf-Dietrich Reips and Uwe Matzat wrote in 2014 that big data had become a \"fad\" in scientific research.[168] Researcher danah boyd has raised concerns about the use of big data in science neglecting principles such as choosing a representative sample by being too concerned about handling the huge amounts of data.[202] This approach may lead to results that have a bias in one way or another.[203] Integration across heterogeneous data resources\u2014some that might be considered big data and others not\u2014presents formidable logistical as well as analytical challenges, but many researchers argue that such integrations are likely to represent the most promising new frontiers in science.[204]\nIn the provocative article \"Critical Questions for Big Data\",[205] the authors title big data a part of mythology: \"large data sets offer a higher form of intelligence and knowledge [...], with the aura of truth, objectivity, and accuracy\". Users of big data are often \"lost in the sheer volume of numbers\", and \"working with Big Data is still subjective, and what it quantifies does not necessarily have a closer claim on objective truth\".[205] Recent developments in BI domain, such as pro-active reporting especially target improvements in the usability of big data, through automated filtering of non-useful data and correlations.[206] Big structures are full of spurious correlations[207] either because of non-causal coincidences (law of truly large numbers), solely nature of big randomness[208] (Ramsey theory), or existence of non-included factors so the hope, of early experimenters to make large databases of numbers \"speak for themselves\" and revolutionize scientific method, is questioned.[209] Catherine Tucker has pointed to \"hype\" around big data, writing \"By itself, big data is unlikely to be valuable.\" The article explains: \"The many contexts where data is cheap relative to the cost of retaining talent to process it, suggests that processing skills are more important than data itself in creating value for a firm.\"[210]\nBig data analysis is often shallow compared to analysis of smaller data sets.[211] In many big data projects, there is no large data analysis happening, but the challenge is the extract, transform, load part of data pre-processing.[211]\nBig data is a buzzword and a \"vague term\",[212][213] but at the same time an \"obsession\"[213] with entrepreneurs, consultants, scientists, and the media. Big data showcases such as Google Flu Trends failed to deliver good predictions in recent years, overstating the flu outbreaks by a factor of two. Similarly, Academy awards and election predictions solely based on Twitter were more often off than on target.\nBig data often poses the same challenges as small data; adding more data does not solve problems of bias, but may emphasize other problems. In particular data sources such as Twitter are not representative of the overall population, and results drawn from such sources may then lead to wrong conclusions. Google Translate\u2014which is based on big data statistical analysis of text\u2014does a good job at translating web pages. However, results from specialized domains may be dramatically skewed.\nOn the other hand, big data may also introduce new problems, such as the multiple comparisons problem: simultaneously testing a large set of hypotheses is likely to produce many false results that mistakenly appear significant.\nIoannidis argued that \"most published research findings are false\"[214] due to essentially the same effect: when many scientific teams and researchers each perform many experiments (i.e. process a big amount of scientific data; although not with big data technology), the likelihood of a \"significant\" result being false grows fast \u2013 even more so, when only positive results are published.\nFurthermore, big data analytics results are only as good as the model on which they are predicated. In an example, big data took part in attempting to predict the results of the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election[215] with varying degrees of success.\nBig data has been used in policing and surveillance by institutions like law enforcement and corporations.[216] Due to the less visible nature of data-based surveillance as compared to traditional methods of policing, objections to big data policing are less likely to arise. According to Sarah Brayne's Big Data Surveillance: The Case of Policing,[217] big data policing can reproduce existing societal inequalities in three ways:\nIf these potential problems are not corrected or regulated, the effects of big data policing may continue to shape societal hierarchies. Conscientious usage of big data policing could prevent individual level biases from becoming institutional biases, Brayne also notes.", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data", "

(computer science) - Wikipedia": {"text": "In computer science, synchronization refers to one of two distinct but related concepts: synchronization of processes, and synchronization of data. Process synchronization refers to the idea that multiple processes are to join up or handshake at a certain point, in order to reach an agreement or commit to a certain sequence of action. Data synchronization refers to the idea of keeping multiple copies of a dataset in coherence with one another, or to maintain data integrity. Process synchronization primitives are commonly used to implement data synchronization.\nThe need for synchronization does not arise merely in multi-processor systems but for any kind of concurrent processes; even in single processor systems. Mentioned below are some of the main needs for synchronization:\nForks and Joins: When a job arrives at a fork point, it is split into N sub-jobs which are then serviced by n tasks. After being serviced, each sub-job waits until all other sub-jobs are done processing. Then, they are joined again and leave the system. Thus, parallel programming requires synchronization as all the parallel processes wait for several other processes to occur.\nProducer-Consumer: In a producer-consumer relationship, the consumer process is dependent on the producer process till the necessary data has been produced.\nExclusive use resources: When multiple processes are dependent on a resource and they need to access it at the same time, the operating system needs to ensure that only one processor accesses it at a given point in time. This reduces  concurrency.\nThread synchronization is defined as a mechanism which ensures that two or more concurrent processes or threads do not simultaneously execute some particular program segment known as critical section. Processes' access to critical section is controlled by using synchronization techniques. When one thread starts executing the critical section (serialized segment of the program) the other thread should wait until the first thread finishes. If proper synchronization techniques[1] are not applied, it may cause a race condition where the values of variables may be unpredictable and vary depending on the timings of context switches of the processes or threads.\nFor example, suppose that there are three processes, namely 1, 2, and 3. All three of them are concurrently executing, and they need to share a common resource (critical section) as shown in Figure 1. Synchronization should be used here to avoid any conflicts for accessing this shared resource. Hence, when Process 1 and 2 both try to access that resource, it should be assigned to only one process at a time.  If it is assigned to Process 1, the other process (Process 2) needs to wait until Process 1 frees that resource (as shown in Figure 2).\nAnother synchronization requirement which needs to be considered is the order in which particular processes or threads should be executed. For example, one cannot board a plane before buying a ticket.  Similarly, one cannot check e-mails before validating the appropriate credentials (for example, user name and password). In the same way, an ATM will not provide any service until it receives a correct PIN.\nOther than mutual exclusion, synchronization also deals with the following:\nOne of the challenges for exascale algorithm design is to minimize or reduce synchronization. \nSynchronization takes more time than computation, especially in distributed computing. Reducing synchronization drew attention from computer scientists for decades. Whereas it becomes an increasingly significant problem recently as the gap between the improvement of computing and latency increases. Experiments have shown that (global) communications due to synchronization on distributed computers takes a dominated share in a sparse iterative solver.[2] This problem is receiving increasing attention after the emergence of a new benchmark metric, the High Performance Conjugate Gradient(HPCG),[3] for ranking the top 500 supercomputers.\nThe following are some classic problems of synchronization:\nThese problems are used to test nearly every newly proposed synchronization scheme or primitive.\nMany systems provide hardware support for critical section code.\nA single processor or uniprocessor system could disable interrupts by executing currently running code without preemption, which is very inefficient on multiprocessor systems.[4]\n\"The key ability we require to implement synchronization in a multiprocessor is a set of hardware primitives with the ability to atomically read and modify a memory location. Without such a capability, the cost of building basic synchronization primitives will be too high and will increase as the processor count increases. There are a number of alternative formulations of the basic hardware primitives, all of which provide the ability to atomically read and modify a location, together with some way to tell if the read and write were performed atomically. These hardware primitives are the basic building blocks that are used to build a wide variety of user-level synchronization operations, including things such as locks and barriers. In general, architects do not expect users to employ the basic hardware primitives, but instead expect that the primitives will be used by system programmers to build a synchronization library, a process that is often complex and tricky.\"[5] Many modern hardware provides special atomic hardware instructions by either test-and-set the memory word or compare-and-swap contents of two memory words.\nIn Java, to prevent thread interference and memory consistency errors, blocks of code are wrapped into synchronized (lock_object) sections. This forces any thread to acquire the said lock object before it can execute the block. The lock is automatically released when the thread which acquired the lock, and is then executing the block, leaves the block or enters the waiting state within the block. Any variable updates, made by a thread in a synchronized block, become visible to other threads when they similarly acquire the lock and execute the block.\nJava synchronized blocks, in addition to enabling mutual exclusion and memory consistency,  enable signaling\u2014i.e., sending events from threads which have acquired the lock and are executing the code block to those which are waiting for the lock within the block. This means that Java synchronized sections combine functionality of mutexes and events. Such primitive is known as synchronization monitor.\nAny object may be used as a lock/monitor in Java. The declaring object is a lock object when the whole method is marked with synchronized.\nThe .NET Framework has synchronization primitives. \"Synchronization is designed to be cooperative, demanding that every thread or process follow the synchronization mechanism before accessing protected resources (critical section) for consistent results.\" In .NET, locking, signaling, lightweight synchronization types, spinwait and interlocked operations are some of mechanisms related to synchronization.[6]\nAnother effective way of implementing synchronization is by using spinlocks. Before accessing any shared resource or piece of code, every processor checks a flag. If the flag is reset, then the processor sets the flag and continues executing the thread. But, if the flag is set (locked), the threads would keep spinning in a loop and keep checking if the flag is set or not. But, spinlocks are effective only if the flag is reset for lower cycles otherwise it can lead to performance issues as it wastes many processor cycles waiting.[7]\nBarriers are simple to implement and provide good responsiveness. They are based on the concept of implementing wait cycles to provide synchronization. Consider three threads running simultaneously, starting from barrier 1. After time t, thread1 reaches barrier 2 but it still has to wait for thread 2 and 3 to reach barrier2 as it does not have the correct data. Once all the threads reach barrier 2 they all start again. After time t, thread 1 reaches barrier3 but it will have to wait for threads 2 and 3 and the correct data again.\nThus, in barrier synchronization of multiple threads there will always be a few threads that will end up waiting for other threads as in the above example thread 1 keeps waiting for thread 2 and 3. This results in severe degradation of the process performance.[8]\nThe barrier synchronization wait function for ith thread can be represented as:\n(Wbarrier)i = f ((Tbarrier)i, (Rthread)i)\nWhere Wbarrier is the wait time for a thread, Tbarrier is the number of threads has arrived, and Rthread is the arrival rate of threads.[9]\nExperiments show that 34% of the total execution time is spent in waiting for other slower threads.[8]\nSemaphores are signalling mechanisms which can allow one or more threads/processors to access a section. A Semaphore has a flag which has a certain fixed value associated with it and each time a thread wishes to access the section, it decrements the flag. Similarly, when the thread leaves the section, the flag is incremented. If the flag is zero, the thread cannot access the section and gets blocked if it chooses to wait.\nSome semaphores would allow only one thread or process in the code section. Such Semaphores are called binary semaphore and are very similar to Mutex. Here, if the value of semaphore is 1, the thread is allowed to access and if the value is 0, the access is denied.[10]\nSynchronization was originally a process-based concept whereby a lock could be obtained on an object. Its primary usage was in databases. There are two types of (file) lock; read-only and read\u2013write. Read-only locks may be obtained by many processes or threads. Readers\u2013writer locks are exclusive, as they may only be used by a single process/thread at a time.\nAlthough locks were derived for file databases, data is also shared in memory between processes and threads. Sometimes more than one object (or file) is locked at a time. If they are not locked simultaneously they can overlap, causing a deadlock exception.\nJava and Ada only have exclusive locks because they are thread based and rely on the compare-and-swap processor instruction.\nAn abstract mathematical foundation for synchronization primitives is given by the history monoid. There are also many higher-level theoretical devices, such as process calculi and Petri nets, which can be built on top of the history monoid.\nFollowing are some synchronization examples with respect to different platforms.[11]\nWindows provides:\nLinux provides:\nEnabling and disabling of kernel preemption replaced spinlocks on uniprocessor systems. Prior to kernel version 2.6, Linux disabled interrupt to implement short critical sections. Since version 2.6 and later, Linux is fully preemptive.\nSolaris provides:\nPthreads is a platform-independent API that provides:\nA distinctly different (but related) concept is that of data synchronization. This refers to the need to update and keep multiple copies of a set of data coherent with one another or to maintain data integrity, Figure 3.[14] For example, database replication is used to keep multiple copies of data synchronized with database servers that store data in different locations.\nExamples include:\nSome of the challenges which user may face in data synchronization:\nData formats tend to grow more complex with time as the organization grows and evolves. This results not only in building simple interfaces between the two applications (source and target), but also in a need to transform the data while passing them to the target application. ETL (extraction transformation loading) tools can be helpful at this stage for managing data format complexities.\nIn real-time systems, customers want to see the current status of their order in e-shop, the current status of a parcel delivery\u2014a real time parcel tracking\u2014, the current balance on their account, etc. This shows the need of a real-time system, which is being updated as well to enable smooth manufacturing process in real-time, e.g., ordering material when enterprise is running out stock, synchronizing customer orders with manufacturing process, etc. From real life, there exist so many examples where real-time processing gives successful and competitive advantage.\nThere are no fixed rules and policies to enforce data security. It may vary depending on the system which you are using. Even though the security is maintained correctly in the source system which captures the data, the security and information access privileges must be enforced on the target systems as well to prevent any potential misuse of the information. This is a serious issue and particularly when it comes for handling secret, confidential and personal information. So because of the sensitivity and confidentiality, data transfer and all in-between information must be encrypted.\nData quality is another serious constraint. For better management and to maintain good quality of data, the common practice is to store the data at one location and share with different people and different systems and/or applications from different locations. It helps in preventing inconsistencies in the data.\nThere are five different phases involved in the data synchronization process:\nEach of these steps is critical. In case of large amounts of data, the synchronization process needs to be carefully planned and executed to avoid any negative impact on performance.", "links":
