{"National Basketball Association - Wikipedia": {"text": "The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a professional basketball league in Northern America composed of 30 teams (29 in the United States and 1 in Canada). It is one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada and is considered the premier men's professional basketball league in the world.[3]\nThe league was founded in New York City on June 6, 1946, as the Basketball Association of America (BAA).[1] It changed its name to the National Basketball Association on August 3, 1949, after merging with the competing National Basketball League (NBL).[4] In 1976, the NBA and the American Basketball Association (ABA) merged, adding four franchises to the NBA. The NBA's regular season runs from October to April, with each team playing 82 games. The league's playoff tournament extends into June. As of 2020[update], NBA players are the world's best paid athletes by average annual salary per player.[5][6][7]\nThe NBA is an active member of USA Basketball (USAB),[8] which is recognized by the FIBA (International Basketball Federation) as the national governing body for basketball in the United States. The league's several international as well as individual team offices are directed out of its head offices in Midtown Manhattan, while its NBA Entertainment and NBA TV studios are directed out of offices located in Secaucus, New Jersey. In North America, the NBA is the third wealthiest professional sport league after the National Football League (NFL) and Major League Baseball (MLB) by revenue, and among the top four in the world.[9]\nThe Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers are tied with the most NBA championships at 17 each. The Golden State Warriors are the defending league champions, as they defeated the Boston Celtics 4\u20132 in the 2022 NBA Finals, to mark the end of the 2021\u201322 season.\nThe Basketball Association of America was founded in 1946 by owners of the major ice hockey arenas in the Northeastern and Midwestern United States and Canada. On November 1, 1946, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the Toronto Huskies hosted the New York Knickerbockers at Maple Leaf Gardens, in a game the NBA now refers to as the first game played in NBA history.[10] The first basket was made by Ossie Schectman of the Knickerbockers. Although there had been earlier attempts at professional basketball leagues, including the American Basketball League (ABL) and the NBL, the BAA was the first league to attempt to play primarily in large arenas in major cities. During its early years, the quality of play in the BAA was not significantly better than in competing leagues or among leading independent clubs such as the Harlem Globetrotters. For instance, the 1948 ABL finalist Baltimore Bullets moved to the BAA and won that league's 1948 title, and the 1948 NBL champion Minneapolis Lakers won the 1949 BAA title. Prior to the 1948\u201349 season, however, NBL teams from Fort Wayne, Indianapolis, Minneapolis, and Rochester jumped to the BAA, which established the BAA as the league of choice for collegians looking to turn professional.[11]\nOn August 3, 1949, the remaining NBL teams\u2013Syracuse, Anderson, Tri-Cities, Sheboygan, Denver, and Waterloo\u2013merged into the BAA. In deference to the merger and to avoid possible legal complications, the league name was changed to the present National Basketball Association, even though the merged league retained the BAA's governing body, including Maurice Podoloff as president.[11] To this day, the NBA claims the BAA's history as its own. It now reckons the arrival of the NBL teams as an expansion, not a merger, and does not recognize NBL records and statistics.[12]\nThe new league had seventeen franchises located in a mix of large and small cities,[13] as well as large arenas and smaller gymnasiums and armories. In 1950, the NBA consolidated to eleven franchises, a process that continued until 1954\u201355, when the league reached its smallest size of eight franchises: the New York Knicks, Boston Celtics, Philadelphia Warriors, Minneapolis Lakers, Rochester Royals, Fort Wayne Pistons, Milwaukee Hawks, and Syracuse Nationals, all of which remain in the league today, although the latter six all did eventually relocate. The process of contraction saw the league's smaller-city franchises move to larger cities. The Hawks had shifted from the Tri-Cities to Milwaukee in 1951, and later shifted to St. Louis in 1955. The Rochester Royals moved from Rochester, New York, to Cincinnati in 1957 and the Pistons moved from Fort Wayne, Indiana, to Detroit in 1957.\nJapanese-American Wataru Misaka broke the NBA color barrier in the 1947\u201348 season when he played for the New York Knicks. He remained the only non-white player in league history prior to the first African-American, Harold Hunter, signing with the Washington Capitols in 1950.[14][15] Hunter was cut from the team during training camp,[14][16] but several African-American players did play in the league later that year, including Chuck Cooper with the Celtics, Nathaniel \"Sweetwater\" Clifton with the Knicks, and Earl Lloyd with the Washington Capitols. During this period, the Minneapolis Lakers, led by center George Mikan, won five NBA Championships and established themselves as the league's first dynasty.[17] To encourage shooting and discourage stalling, the league introduced the 24-second shot clock in 1954.[18] If a team does not attempt to score a field goal (or the ball fails to make contact with the rim) within 24 seconds of obtaining the ball, play is stopped and the ball given to its opponent.\nIn 1957, rookie center Bill Russell joined the Boston Celtics, which already featured guard Bob Cousy and coach Red Auerbach, and went on to lead the franchise to eleven NBA titles in thirteen seasons. Center Wilt Chamberlain entered the league with the Warriors in 1959 and became a dominant individual star of the 1960s, setting new single-game records in scoring (100) and rebounding (55). Russell's rivalry with Chamberlain became one of the greatest rivalries in the history of American team sports.\nThe 1960s were dominated by the Celtics. Led by Russell, Cousy, and Auerbach, Boston won eight straight championships in the NBA from 1959 to 1966. This championship streak is the longest in NBA history. They did not win the title in 1966\u201367, but regained it in the 1967\u201368 season and repeated in 1969. The domination totaled nine of the ten championship banners of the 1960s.[19]\nThrough this period, the NBA continued to evolve with the shift of the Minneapolis Lakers to Los Angeles, the Philadelphia Warriors to San Francisco, the Syracuse Nationals to Philadelphia to become the Philadelphia 76ers, and the St. Louis Hawks moving to Atlanta, as well as the addition of its first expansion franchises. The Chicago Packers (now Washington Wizards) became the ninth NBA team in 1961. From 1966 to 1968, the league expanded from 9 to 14 teams, introducing the Chicago Bulls, Seattle SuperSonics (now Oklahoma City Thunder), San Diego Rockets (who moved to Houston four years later), Milwaukee Bucks, and Phoenix Suns.\nIn 1967, the league faced a new external threat with the formation of the American Basketball Association (ABA). The leagues engaged in a bidding war. The NBA landed the most important college star of the era, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (then known as Lew Alcindor). However, the NBA's leading scorer, Rick Barry, jumped to the ABA, as did four veteran referees\u2014Norm Drucker, Earl Strom, John Vanak, and Joe Gushue.[20]\nIn 1969, Alan Siegel, who oversaw the design of Jerry Dior's Major League Baseball logo a year prior, created the modern NBA logo inspired by the MLB's. It incorporates the silhouette of Jerry West, based on a photo by Wen Roberts. The NBA would not confirm that a particular player was used because, according to Siegel, \"They want to institutionalize it rather than individualize it. It's become such a ubiquitous, classic symbol and focal point of their identity and their licensing program that they don't necessarily want to identify it with one player.\" The iconic logo debuted in 1971 (with a small change to the typeface on the NBA wordmark in 2017) and would remain a fixture of the NBA brand.[21]\nThe ABA succeeded in signing a number of major stars in the 1970s, including Julius Erving of the Virginia Squires, in part because it allowed teams to sign college undergraduates. The NBA expanded rapidly during this period. From 1966 to 1974, the NBA grew from nine franchises to 18. In 1970, the Portland Trail Blazers, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Buffalo Braves (now the Los Angeles Clippers) all made their debuts expanding the league to 17.[22] The New Orleans Jazz (now in Utah) came aboard in 1974 bringing the total to 18. Following the 1976 season, the leagues reached a settlement that provided for the addition of four ABA franchises to the NBA, raising the number of franchises in the league at that time to 22. The franchises added were the San Antonio Spurs, Denver Nuggets, Indiana Pacers, and New York Nets (now the Brooklyn Nets). Some of the biggest stars of this era were Abdul-Jabbar, Barry, Dave Cowens, Erving, Elvin Hayes, Walt Frazier, Moses Malone, Artis Gilmore, George Gervin, Dan Issel, and Pete Maravich. The end of the decade, however, saw declining TV ratings, low attendance and drug-related player issues \u2013 both perceived and real \u2013 that threatened to derail the league.\nThe league added the ABA's three-point field goal beginning in 1979.[23] That same year, rookies Larry Bird and Magic Johnson joined the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers respectively, initiating a period of significant growth of fan interest in the NBA.[24] The two had faced each other in the 1979 NCAA Division I Basketball Championship Game, and they later played against each other in three NBA Finals (1984, 1985, and 1987).[24] In the 10 seasons of the 1980s, Johnson led the Lakers to five titles[25] while Bird led the Celtics to three titles.[26] Also in the early 1980s, the NBA added one more expansion franchise, the Dallas Mavericks,[27] bringing the total to 23 teams. Later on, Larry Bird won the first three three-point shooting contests.[28] On February 1, 1984 David Stern became commissioner of the NBA.[29] Stern has been recognized as playing a major role in the growth of the league during his career.[30][31]\nMichael Jordan entered the league in 1984 with the Chicago Bulls, spurring more interest in the league.[32] In 1988 and 1989, four cities got their wishes as the Charlotte Hornets, Miami Heat, Orlando Magic, and Minnesota Timberwolves made their NBA debuts, bringing the total to 27 teams.[33] The Detroit Pistons won the back-to-back NBA Championships in 1989 and 1990, led by coach Chuck Daly and guard Isiah Thomas.[34] Jordan and Scottie Pippen led the Bulls to two three-peats in eight years during the 1991\u20131998 seasons.[35][36] Hakeem Olajuwon won back-to-back titles with the Houston Rockets in 1994 and 1995.[37]\nThe 1992 Olympic basketball Dream Team, the first to use current NBA stars, featured Michael Jordan as the anchor, along with Bird, Johnson, David Robinson, Patrick Ewing, Scottie Pippen, Clyde Drexler, Karl Malone, John Stockton, Chris Mullin, Charles Barkley, and star NCAA amateur Christian Laettner.[38] The team was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, while 11 of the 12 players (along with three out of four coaches) have been inducted as individuals in their own right.[39]\nIn 1995, the NBA expanded to Canada with the addition of the Vancouver Grizzlies and the Toronto Raptors.[40][41] In 1996, the NBA created a women's league, the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA).[42]\nIn 1998, the NBA owners began a lockout that suspended all league business until a new labor agreement could be reached, which led to the season being shortened in half.[43][44] The San Antonio Spurs won the championship at the end of the 1998\u201399 season, becoming the first former ABA team to win the NBA championship.[45]\nAfter the breakup of the Chicago Bulls championship roster in the summer of 1998, the Western Conference has dominated. The Los Angeles Lakers of coach Phil Jackson and the San Antonio Spurs of Gregg Popovich combined to make 13 Finals in 16 seasons, with 10 titles. Tim Duncan and David Robinson won the 1999 championship with the Spurs, and Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant started the 2000s with three consecutive championships for the Lakers. The Spurs reclaimed the title in 2003 against the Nets. In 2004, the Lakers returned to the Finals, only to lose in five games to the Detroit Pistons.\nThe league's image was marred by a violent incident between players and fans in a November 2004 game between the Indiana Pacers and Detroit Pistons. In response, players were suspended for a total of 146 games with $11\u00a0million total lost in salary, and the league tightened security and limited the sale of alcohol.\nOn May 19, 2005, Commissioner Stern testified before the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Government Reform about the NBA's actions to combat the use of steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs. The NBA started its drug-testing program in 1983 and substantially improved it in 1999. In the 1999\u20132000 season, all players were randomly tested during training camp, and all rookies were additionally tested three more times during the regular season. Of the nearly 4,200 tests for steroids and performance-enhancing drugs conducted over six seasons, only three players were confirmed positive for NBA's drug program, all were immediately suspended, and as of the time of the testimony, none were playing with the NBA.[46]\nAfter the Spurs won the championship again in 2005, the 2006 Finals featured two franchises making their inaugural Finals appearances. The Miami Heat, led by their star shooting guard, Dwyane Wade, and Shaquille O'Neal, who had been traded from the Lakers during summer 2004, won the series over the Dallas Mavericks. The Lakers/Spurs dominance continued in 2007 with a four-game sweep by the Spurs over the LeBron James-led Cleveland Cavaliers. The 2008 Finals saw a rematch of the league's highest profile rivalry, the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers, with the Celtics winning, for their 17th championship. The Lakers won back-to-back championships in 2009 and 2010, against the Orlando Magic and the Celtics.[47][48] The 2010 NBA All-Star Game was held at Cowboys Stadium in front of the largest crowd ever, 108,713.[49]\nA referee lockout began on September 1, 2009, when the contract between the NBA and its referees expired. The first preseason games were played on October 1, 2009, and replacement referees from the WNBA and NBA Development League were used, the first time replacement referees had been used since the beginning of the 1995\u201396 season. The NBA and the regular referees reached a deal on October 23, 2009.[50][51]\nAt the start of the 2010\u201311 season, free agents LeBron James and Chris Bosh signed with the Miami Heat, joining Dwyane Wade to form the \"Big Three\". The Heat dominated the league, reaching the Finals for four straight years. In 2011, they faced a re-match with the Dallas Mavericks but lost to the Dirk Nowitzki-led team. They won back-to-back titles in 2012 and 2013 against the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Spurs, and lost a re-match to the Spurs in the 2014 Finals.\nThe 2011\u201312 season began with another lockout, the league's fourth.[52] After the first few weeks of the season were canceled, the players and owners ratified a new collective bargaining agreement on December 8, 2011, setting up a shortened 66-game season.[53] On February 1, 2014, commissioner David Stern retired after 30 years in the position, and was succeeded by his deputy, Adam Silver.\nAfter four seasons with the Miami Heat, LeBron James returned to the Cleveland Cavaliers for the 2014\u201315 season. He led the team to their second Finals appearance with the help of Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love. The Golden State Warriors defeated the Cavaliers in six games, led by the \"Splash Brothers\" Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson. The Cavaliers and the Warriors faced each other in the Finals a record four consecutive times. In the 2015\u201316 season, the Warriors finished the season 73\u20139, the best season record in NBA history.[54] However, the Cavaliers overcame a 3\u20131 deficit in the Finals to win their first championship that season.[55] In the 2016\u201317 season, the Warriors benefited from the recruitment of free agent Kevin Durant. The Warriors won the 2017 and 2018 Finals against the Cavaliers.\nAfter the departure of James in free agency in 2018, the Cavaliers' streak of playoff and Finals appearances ended. The Warriors returned for a fifth consecutive Finals appearance in 2019 but lost to the Toronto Raptors, who won their first championship after acquiring Kawhi Leonard in a trade.[56]\nThe 2019\u201320 season was suspended indefinitely on March 11, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, after Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert tested positive for the coronavirus.[57][58] On June 4, 2020, the NBA Board of Governors voted to resume the season in a 22-team format with 8 seeding games per team and a regular playoffs format, with all games played in a \"bubble\" in Walt Disney World without any fans present.[59][60][61]\nThis era also saw the continuous near year-over-year decline in NBA viewership. Between 2012 and 2019, the league lost 40 to 45 percent of its viewership. While some of it can be attributed to \"cable-cutting\", other professional leagues, like the NFL and MLB have retained stable viewership demographics. The opening game of the 2020 Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and Miami Heat brought in only 7.41\u00a0million viewers to ABC, according to The Hollywood Reporter. That is reportedly the lowest viewership seen for the Finals since at least 1994, when total viewers began to be regularly recorded and is a 45 percent decline from game one between the Golden State Warriors and Toronto Raptors, which had 13.51\u00a0million viewers a year earlier. Some attribute this decline to the political stances the league and its players are taking, while others consider load management, the uneven talent distribution between the conferences and the cord-cutting of younger viewers as the main reason for the decline.[62][63][64][65][66]\nFollowing pioneers like Vlade Divac (Serbia) and Dra\u017een Petrovi\u0107 (Croatia) who joined the NBA in the late 1980s, an increasing number of international players have moved directly from playing elsewhere in the world to starring in the NBA. Since 2006, the NBA has faced EuroLeague teams in exhibition matches in the NBA Europe Live Tour, and since 2009, in the EuroLeague American Tour. The 2013\u201314 season opened with a record 92 international players on the opening night rosters, representing 39 countries and comprising over 20% of the league.[67] The beginning of the 2017\u201318 season saw a record 108 international players representing 42 countries marking 4 consecutive years of at least 100 international players and each team having at least one international player.[68] In 2018, the Phoenix Suns hired Serbian coach Igor Koko\u0161kov as their new head coach, replacing Canadian interim coach Jay Triano, making Koko\u0161kov the first European coach to become a head coach for a team in the NBA.\nIn 2001, an affiliated minor league, the National Basketball Development League, now called the NBA G League, was created.[69]\nTwo years after the Hornets' move to New Orleans, the NBA returned to North Carolina, as the Charlotte Bobcats were formed as an expansion team in 2004.\nThe Hornets temporarily moved to Oklahoma City in 2005 for two seasons because of damage caused by Hurricane Katrina. The team returned to New Orleans in 2007.\nA new official game ball was introduced on June 28, 2006, for the 2006\u201307 season, marking the first change to the ball in over 35 years and only the second ball in 60 seasons.[70] Manufactured by Spalding, the new ball featured a new design and new synthetic material that Spalding claimed offered a better grip, feel, and consistency than the original ball. However, many players were vocal in their disdain for the new ball, saying that it was too sticky when dry, and too slippery when wet.\nCommissioner Stern announced on December 11, 2006, that beginning January 1, 2007, the NBA would return to the traditional leather basketball in use prior to the 2006\u201307 season. The change was influenced by frequent player complaints and confirmed hand injuries (cuts) caused by the microfiber ball.[71] The Players' Association had filed a suit on behalf of the players against the NBA over the new ball.[72] As of the 2017\u201318 season[update], the NBA team jerseys are manufactured by Nike, replacing the previous supplier, Adidas. All teams will wear jerseys with the Nike logo except the Charlotte Hornets, whose jerseys will instead have the Jumpman logo associated with longtime Nike endorser Michael Jordan, who owns the Hornets.[73]\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began an investigation on July 19, 2007, over allegations that veteran NBA referee Tim Donaghy bet on basketball games he officiated over the past two seasons and that he made calls affecting the point spread in those games.[74] On August 15, 2007, Donaghy pleaded guilty to two federal charges related to the investigation. Donaghy claimed in 2008 that certain referees were friendly with players and \"company men\" for the NBA, and he alleged that referees influenced the outcome of certain playoff and finals games in 2002 and 2005. NBA commissioner David Stern denied the allegations and said Donaghy was a convicted felon and a \"singing, cooperating witness\".[75] Donaghy served 15 months in prison and was released in November 2009.[76] According to an independent study by Ronald Beech of Game 6 of the 2002 Western Conference Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and Sacramento Kings, although the refs increased the Lakers' chances of winning through foul calls during the game, there was no collusion to fix the game. On alleged \"star treatment\" during Game 6 by the referees toward certain players, Beech claimed, \"there does seem to be issues with different standards and allowances for different players.\"[77]\nThe NBA Board of Governors approved the request of the Seattle SuperSonics to move to Oklahoma City on April 18, 2008.[78] The team, however, could not move until it had settled a lawsuit filed by the city of Seattle, which was intended to keep the SuperSonics in Seattle for the remaining two seasons of the team's lease at KeyArena. Following a court case, the city of Seattle settled with the ownership group of the SuperSonics on July 2, 2008, allowing the team to move to Oklahoma City immediately in exchange for terminating the final two seasons of the team's lease at KeyArena.[79] The Oklahoma City Thunder began playing in the 2008\u201309 season.\nThe first outdoor game in the modern era of the league was played at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden on October 11, 2008, between the Phoenix Suns and the Denver Nuggets.[80]\nThe first official NBA league games on European ground took place in 2011. In two matchups, the New Jersey Nets faced the Toronto Raptors at the O2 Arena in London in front of over 20,000 fans.\nAfter the 2012\u201313 season, the New Orleans Hornets were renamed the Pelicans.[81] During the 2013\u201314 season, Stern retired as commissioner after 30 years, and deputy commissioner Adam Silver ascended to the position of commissioner. During that season's playoffs, the Bobcats officially reclaimed the Hornets name, and by agreement with the league and the Pelicans, also received sole ownership of all history, records, and statistics from the Pelicans' time in Charlotte. As a result, the Hornets are now officially considered to have been founded in 1988, suspended operations in 2002, and resumed in 2004 as the Bobcats, while the Pelicans are officially treated as a 2002 expansion team.[82] (This is somewhat similar to the relationship between the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Ravens in the NFL.)\nDonald Sterling, who was then-owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, received a lifetime ban from the NBA on April 29, 2014, after racist remarks he made became public. Sterling was also fined US$2.5\u00a0million, the maximum allowed under the NBA Constitution.[83]\nBecky Hammon was hired by the San Antonio Spurs on August 5, 2014, as an assistant coach, becoming the second female coach in NBA history but the first full-time coach.[84][85] This also makes her the first full-time female coach in any of the four major professional sports in North America.[85]\nThe NBA announced on April 15, 2016, that it would allow all 30 of its teams to sell corporate sponsor advertisement patches on official game uniforms, beginning with the 2017\u201318 season. The sponsorship advertisement patches would appear on the left front of jerseys, opposite Nike's logo, marking the first time a manufacturer's logo would appear on NBA jerseys, and would measure approximately 2.5 by 2.5 inches. The NBA would become the first major North American professional sports league to allow corporate sponsorship logos on official team uniforms, and the last to have a uniform manufacturer logo appear on its team uniforms.[86] The first team to announce a jersey sponsorship was the Philadelphia 76ers, who agreed to a deal with StubHub.[87]\nOn July 6, 2017, the NBA unveiled an updated rendition of its logo; it was largely identical to the previous design, except with revised typography and a \"richer\" color scheme. The league began to phase in the updated logo across its properties during the 2017 NBA Summer League.[88]\nThe NBA also officially released new Nike uniforms for all 30 teams beginning with the 2017\u201318 season. The league eliminated \"home\" and \"away\" uniform designations. Instead, each team would have four or six uniforms: the \"Association\" edition, which is the team's white uniform, the \"Icon\" edition, which is the team's color uniform, and the \"Statement\" and \"City\" uniforms, which most teams use as an alternate uniform.[89] In 2018, the NBA also released the \"Earned\" uniform.[90]\nThe NBA originated in 1946 with 11 teams, and through a sequence of team expansions, reductions and relocations currently consists of 30 teams. The United States is home to 29 teams; another is in Canada.\nThe current league organization divides 30 teams into two conferences of three divisions with five teams each. The current divisional alignment was introduced in the 2004\u201305 season. Reflecting the population distribution of the United States and Canada as a whole, most teams are in the eastern half of the country: 13 teams are in the Eastern Time Zone, nine in the Central, three in the Mountain, and five in the Pacific.\nFollowing the summer break, teams begin training camps in late September. Training camps allow the coaching staff to evaluate players (especially rookies), scout the team's strengths and weaknesses, prepare the players for the rigorous regular season and determine the 12-man active roster (and a 3-man inactive list) with which they will begin the regular season. Teams have the ability to assign players with less than two years of experience to the NBA G League. After training camp, a series of preseason exhibition games are held. Preseason matches are sometimes held in non-NBA cities, both in the United States and overseas. The NBA regular season begins in the last week of October.\nDuring the regular season, each team plays 82 games, 41 each home and away. A team faces opponents in its own division four times a year (16 games). Each team plays six of the teams from the other two divisions in its conference four times (24 games), and the remaining four teams three times (12 games). Finally, each team plays all the teams in the other conference twice apiece (30 games). This asymmetrical structure means the strength of schedule will vary between teams (but not as significantly as the NFL or MLB). Over five seasons, each team will have played 80 games against their division (20 games against each opponent, 10 at home, 10 on the road), 180 games against the rest of their conference (18 games against each opponent, 9 at home, 9 on the road), and 150 games against the other conference (10 games against each team, 5 at home, 5 on the road).\nThe NBA is also the only league that regularly schedules games on Christmas Day.[91] The league has been playing games regularly on the holiday since 1947,[92] though the first Christmas Day games were not televised until 1983\u201384.[93] Games played on this day have featured some of the best teams and players.[91][92][93] Christmas is also notable for NBA on television, as the holiday is when the first NBA games air on network television each season.[92][93] Games played on this day have been some of the highest-rated games during a particular season.\nIn February, the regular season pauses to celebrate the annual NBA All-Star Game. Fans vote throughout the United States, Canada, and on the Internet, and the top vote-getters in each conference are named captains. Fan votes determine the rest of the allstar starters. Coaches vote to choose the remaining 14 All-Stars. Then, the top vote-getters in each conference draft their own team from a player pool of allstars. The top vote-getter in the league earns first pick and so forth. The player with the best performance during the game is rewarded with a Game MVP award. Other attractions of the All-Star break include the Rising Stars Challenge (originally Rookie Challenge), where the top rookies and second-year players in the NBA play in a 5-on-5 basketball game, with the current format pitting U.S. players against those from the rest of the world; the Skills Challenge, where players compete to finish an obstacle course consisting of shooting, passing, and dribbling in the fastest time; the Three Point Contest, where players compete to score the highest number of three-point field goals in a given time; and the NBA Slam Dunk Contest, where players compete to dunk the ball in the most entertaining way according to the judges. These other attractions have varying names which include the names of the various sponsors who have paid for naming rights.\nShortly after the All-Star break is the trade deadline, which is set to fall on the 16th Thursday of the season (usually in February) at 3\u00a0pm Eastern Time.[94] After this date, teams are not allowed to exchange players with each other for the remainder of the season, although they may still sign and release players. Major trades are often completed right before the trading deadline, making that day a hectic time for general managers.\nAround the middle of April, the regular season ends. It is during this time that voting begins for individual awards, as well as the selection of the honorary, league-wide, postseason teams. The Sixth Man of the Year Award is given to the best player coming off the bench (must have more games coming off the bench than actual games started). The Rookie of the Year Award is awarded to the most outstanding first-year player. The Most Improved Player Award is awarded to the player who is deemed to have shown the most improvement from the previous season. The Defensive Player of the Year Award is awarded to the league's best defender. The Coach of the Year Award is awarded to the coach that has made the most positive difference to a team. The Most Valuable Player Award is given to the player deemed the most valuable for (his team) that season. Additionally, Sporting News awards an unofficial (but widely recognized) Executive of the Year Award to the general manager who is adjudged to have performed the best job for the benefit of his franchise.\nThe postseason teams are the All-NBA Team, the All-Defensive Team, and the All-Rookie Team; each consists of five players. There are three All-NBA teams, consisting of the top players at each position, with first-team status being the most desirable. There are two All-Defensive teams, consisting of the top defenders at each position. There are also two All-Rookie teams, consisting of the top first-year players regardless of position.[95][96]\nThe NBA playoffs begin in April after the conclusion of the regular season with the top eight teams in each conference, regardless of divisional alignment, competing for the league's championship title, the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy. Seeds are awarded in strict order of regular season record (with a tiebreaker system used as needed).\nHaving a higher seed offers several advantages. Since the first seed begins the playoffs playing against the eighth seed, the second seed plays the seventh seed, the third seed plays the sixth seed, and the fourth seed plays the fifth seed, having a higher seed means a team faces a weaker team in the first round. The team in each series with the better record has home-court advantage, including the First Round. Before the league changed its playoff determination format for the 2006\u201307 season, this meant that, for example, if the team that received the sixth seed had a better record than the team with the third seed (by virtue of a divisional championship), the sixth seed would have home-court advantage, even though the other team had a higher seed. Therefore, the team with the best regular season record in the league is guaranteed home-court advantage in every series it plays. For example, in 2006, the Denver Nuggets won 44 games and captured the Northwest Division and the third seed. Their opponent was the sixth-seeded Los Angeles Clippers, who won 47 games and finished second in the Pacific Division. Although Denver won its much weaker division, the Clippers had a home-court advantage and won the series in 5.\nThe playoffs follow a tournament format. Each team plays an opponent in a best-of-seven series, with the first team to win four games advancing into the next round, while the other team is eliminated from the playoffs. In the next round, the successful team plays against another advancing team of the same conference. All but one team in each conference are eliminated from the playoffs. Since the NBA does not re-seed teams, the playoff bracket in each conference uses a traditional design, with the winner of the series matching the first- and eighth-seeded teams playing the winner of the series matching the fourth- and fifth-seeded teams, and the winner of the series matching the second- and seventh-seeded teams playing the winner of the series matching the third- and sixth-seeded teams. In every round, the best-of-7 series follows a 2\u20132\u20131\u20131\u20131 home-court pattern, meaning that one team will have home court in games 1, 2, 5, and 7, while the other plays at home in games 3, 4, and 6. From 1985 to 2013, the NBA Finals followed a 2\u20133\u20132 pattern, meaning that one team had home court in games 1, 2, 6, and 7, while the other played at home in games 3, 4, and 5.[97]\nThe final playoff round, a best-of-seven series between the victors of both conferences, is known as the NBA Finals and is held annually in June. The winner of the NBA Finals receives the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy. Each player and major contributor\u2014including coaches and the general manager\u2014on the winning team receive a championship ring. In addition, the league awards the Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award to the best performing player of the series.\nThe league began using its current format, with the top eight teams in each conference advancing regardless of divisional alignment, in the 2015\u201316 season. Previously, the top three seeds went to the division winners.[98]\nThe Los Angeles Lakers and the Boston Celtics have won the most championships with each having 17 NBA Finals wins. Followed by Golden State Warriors and Chicago Bulls with seven and six titles\nCurrent teams that have no NBA Finals appearances:\nAs one of the major sports leagues in North America, the NBA has a long history of partnerships with television networks in the United States. The NBA signed a contract with DuMont Television Network in its eighth season, the 1953\u201354 season, marking the first year the NBA had a national television broadcaster. Similar to the National Football League, the lack of television stations led to NBC taking over the rights from the 1954\u201355 season until April 7, 1962\u2013NBC's first tenure with the NBA. Currently in the U.S., the NBA has a contract with ESPN (and ABC) and TNT through the 2024\u201325 season. Games that are not broadcast nationally are usually aired over regional sports networks specific to the area where the teams are located.\nThe National Basketball Association has sporadically participated in international club competitions. From 1987 to 1999 an NBA team played against championship club teams from Asia, Europe and South America in the McDonald's Championship. This tournament was won by the NBA invitee every year it was held.[99]\nIn 2022, an average ticket cost $77.75.[100] Depending on the market and stage of the season\u2014preseason, regular season, postseason\u2014a ticket can range from $10 to $70,000.[a][101]\nIn 2020, ticket prices for the NBA All Star Game became more expensive than ever before, averaging around $2,600, and even more on the secondary market.[102]\nAccording to Nielsen's survey, in 2013 the NBA had the youngest audience, with 45 percent of its viewers under 35, but the least likely, along with Major League Baseball, to be watched by women, who make up only 30% of the viewership. As of 2014[update], 45 percent of its viewers were black, while 40 percent of viewers were white, making it the only top North American sport that does not have a white majority audience.[103]\nAs of 2017[update], the NBA's popularity further declined among White Americans, who during the 2016\u201317 season, made up only 34% of the viewership. At the same time, the black viewership increased to 47 percent, while Hispanic (of any race) stood at 11% and Asian viewership stood at 8%. According to the same poll, the NBA was favored more strongly by Democrats than Republicans.[104]\nOutside the U.S., the NBA's biggest international market is in China,[105][106] where an estimated 800 million viewers watched the 2017\u201318 season.[107] NBA China is worth approximately $4\u00a0billion.[105][106]\nThe NBA has been involved in a number of controversies over the years and has received a significant amount of criticism.[108][109][110]\nFollowing pioneers like Vlade Divac (Serbia) and Dra\u017een Petrovi\u0107 (Croatia) who joined the NBA in the late 1980s, an increasing number of international players have moved directly from playing elsewhere in the world to starring in the NBA. Below is a short list of foreign players who have won NBA awards or have been otherwise recognized for their contributions to basketball, either currently or formerly active in the league:\nOn some occasions, young players, most but not all from the English-speaking world, have attended U.S. colleges before playing in the NBA. Notable examples are:\nSince 2006, the NBA has faced EuroLeague teams in exhibition matches in the NBA Europe Live Tour, and since 2009 in the EuroLeague American Tour.\nThe 2013\u201314 season opened with a record 92 international players on the opening night rosters, representing 39 countries and comprising over 20 percent of the league.[67] The NBA defines \"international\" players as those born outside the 50 United States and Washington, D.C. This means that:\nThe league has a global social responsibility program, NBA Cares, that is responsible for the league's stated mission of addressing important social issues worldwide.[112]\n1961\n1966\n1967\n1968\n1970\n1974\n1980\n1988\n1989\n1995\n2004", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_basketball_association", "

Wikipedia": {"text": "The Liga Ouro de Basquete (LOB) (English: Gold Basketball League) is the second-tier level men's professional club basketball league in Brazil. It is organized by the Liga Nacional de Basquete (LNB) (National Basketball League), with the approval of the Confedera\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Basketball (CBB) (Brazilian Basketball Confederation).[1]\nThe Liga Ouro de Basquete (Gold Basketball League) was founded by the Liga Nacional de Basquete (LNB) (National Basketball League), with the approval of the Confedera\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Basketball (CBB) (Brazilian Basketball Confederation), in November 2013. The first season of the competition was held in 2014.[2][3] The number of teams competing in the league gradually increased over time. In the league's first 3 seasons (2014, 2015, 2016), there were only 4 teams participating. The number of teams was increased to 6 for the 2017 season, and to 9 for the 2018 season.\nIn October 2018, it was announced that the 2019 season[4] would be the last season of the Liga Ouro de Basquete, and that a new competition, organized by the Brazilian Basketball Confederation (CBB), would replace it.[5]\nThe regular season of the Liga Ouro de Basquete is usually played in the first half of the year. During the first 3 editions of the league, when it had just 4 teams, the regular season ran under a system where all of the teams played each other four times each (two home games and two away games). The first placed team qualified for the league's Grand Finals automatically, and the second and third placed teams faced off to determine the other Grand Finals team.\nIn 2018, with the increase of the number of teams in the league to 6, the format was changed to a system where all of the teams played each other twice (once at home, and once on the road). The first two placed teams qualified directly to the league's semifinals, while the third to sixth placed teams competed for the other two semifinals places. The league's playoffs begin shortly after the end of the regular season, with quarterfinals games played between the third and sixth placed teams in the league's final regular season standings. The quarterfinals are played in a three game series. The winners of the quarterfinals play the top two placed regular season teams in a best of five series format in the semifinals.\nThe Grand Finals is played in a best of five games format. The winner of the league's Grand Finals series is crowned the league's champion, and also earns a league promotion to Brazil's top-tier level league, the NBB, for the following season.[6]", "links":

League - Wikipedia": {"text": "The National Lacrosse League (NLL) is a men's professional box lacrosse league in North America. The league is headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\nThe NLL currently has fifteen teams: ten in the United States and five in Canada.[1] The NLL ranks third in average attendance for pro indoor sports worldwide, behind only the NHL and NBA.[2] Unlike other box lacrosse leagues which play in the summer, the NLL plays its games in the winter and spring, from December to June. Each year, the playoff teams battle for the National Lacrosse League Cup. The NLL has averaged between 8,900 and 10,700 spectators per game each year since 2004.[3][4]\nThe NLL plays four 15-minute quarters with 2-minute breaks between quarters and a 15-minute half-time. At the start of the each quarter and after every goal, players will \"face-off\" at the center of the field to determine who will get possession. This is done by the two players pushing the heads of their sticks together with the game ball  in the middle. A scrum-like match usually happens when the players on either team try and win the ball. [5]\nIf a game is tied after regulation, the two teams play sudden death overtime. Each team may take a 45-second timeout per half. Each team dresses 19 players: 2 goaltenders and 17 \"runners\".[6] NLL goals are 4'9\" wide and 4' tall.\nThe NLL uses a 30-second shot clock which is similar to a professional or collegiate basketball shot clock. The clock will start its countdown once one team gets possession of the ball. If the offense does not shoot the ball in time, they lose possession. However, if the offense shoots on goal and then re-retrieves the ball then the shot clock is restarted.[7]\nFighting is a 5-minute major penalty and does not result in an automatic ejection.[8]\nEach team in the NLL plays eighteen games during the regular season, nine each at home and away. The teams are divided into two divisions: the eight-team East and the seven-team West Division. NLL games are typically played on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays while some weekends see a team(s) play twice.\nThe regular season begins in December and ends in April. Starting in 2018, the league announced that the playoffs would be expanded to eight teams to accommodate expansion.[9] For the 2022 playoffs, the top four teams in the East and top three teams in the West automatically qualified. The final playoff spot is awarded to the team with the next best record: the fourth in the West, or the fifth in the East. In 2022, that spot was given to the East's Philadelphia Wings. The first round is single-elimination, and the Conference Finals and Championship rounds are best-of-three.[10]\nThe NLL adopted a soft salary cap of US$400,000 per team for the 2013 season. The average base salary as of the 2013 season was $19,135.[11] The maximum salary for a franchise player is approximately $34,000.[12]\nMost NLL players have full-time jobs off the floor, such as Buffalo's John Tavares, a high school teacher in Mississauga, Ontario.[13] As of 2018, the NLL salary cap was $415,000, with Buffalo Business First reporter Paul Lane citing the following pay scale: [14]\nAlthough ten of the fifteen teams are based in the U.S., less than 7% of players are Americans. About 83% are Canadians and 10% Iroquois from either Canada or the U.S.[15]\nAn asterisk (*) denotes the franchise moved to its present location and has been in one or more previous locations in its history.\nThe rebirth of major professional box lacrosse in the United States came on March 13, 1986, with the formation of the Eagle Pro Box Lacrosse League (EPBLL), which was incorporated by Russ Cline and Chris Fritz.[16] The \"Eagle League\" moniker was inspired by a meeting with Iroquois leaders, whose culture views the animal as a tutelary spirit.[17] Previously, in 1985 box lacrosse sponsored an event played at the Spectrum in Philadelphia. The USA/Canada Superseries was an eight-game series seen as a precursor to the Major Indoor Lacrosse League.\nThe league opened play for the 1987 season with two games on January 10, 1987: the Philadelphia Wings at the New Jersey Saints (Philadelphia defeating New Jersey by 11\u20138) and the Baltimore Thunder at the Washington Wave. Darrell Russell was named Commissioner of the league.\nThe four teams contested a six-game regular season before a postseason which saw all four teams qualify for a single knockout tournament which ended with the Baltimore Thunder being crowned as the EPBLL's first champion in 1987.[16] Coached by Bob Griebe, the Baltimore Thunder defeated the Washington Wave by a score of 11\u201310 to capture the league's first championship.\nThe league announced that a total of 124,536 fans attended Eagle Pro Box Lacrosse League games in its first season. Those same four teams played in the second season of the EPBLL.[16] The teams expanded to an eight-game schedule, and set up a three-team playoff with the regular season winner claiming a bye to the title game.\nThe league began its second season with each of the four teams playing an eight-game schedule. The New Jersey Saints became the second league champions by defeating the Washington Wave, 17\u201316 before 8,125 fans at the Capital Centre. For the Wave, it was the second time in as many years they reached the championship game, only to come away on the short end of a one-goal game.\nThe league then announced that the Saints would relocate to the Nassau Coliseum on Long Island beginning in the 1989 season. The team name was changed to the New York Saints to reflect their new home. The MILL announced that it would award expansion teams to Detroit, Michigan, and Boston, Massachusetts. The teams began play in the 1989 season. The Detroit team was named the Turbos, and began play in the Joe Louis Arena. Their team colors were announced to be purple, silver and black. The Boston entry was called the New England Blazers and they played their home games at the Worcester Centrum. The Blazers used green, orange, and white as their team colors.\nPrior to its third campaign, the league changed its name to the more conventional Major Indoor Lacrosse League (MILL), as the spiritual implications of its original name proved too cryptic for most people to understand.[17] The season opened with six teams: the Baltimore Thunder, the Detroit Turbos, the New England Blazers, the New York Saints, the Philadelphia Wings, and the Washington Wave. Each of the six teams played an eight-game schedule in 1989, with an even four home and road games.\nIn its first ever regular season game, 12,171 Detroit fans watched the expansion Turbos defeat the Washington Wave, 11\u20139, in the debut of the 1989 season. As the season went on, regular season attendance figures for the league totaled at 230,724 for 24 regular season games, which made an average of 9,614 people in the stands per game. When adding the postseason, the numbers grew to 255,088 total and an average of 9,811 a game.\nLater that year, the Philadelphia Wings captured the league championship in front of a record postseason crowd of 16,042 at the Spectrum, defeating the New York Saints, 11\u201310. After the championship game, the league announced the expansion into Pittsburgh, a team later to be called the Bulls, who played at the Civic Arena, sporting the traditional Pittsburgh colors of black and gold, like the Steelers.\nIn 1990, the MILL prepared to open its fourth season with six teams: the Baltimore Thunder, Detroit Turbos, New England Blazers, New York Saints, Philadelphia Wings, and Pittsburgh Bulls. Each of the six teams played an eight-game schedule over the 1990 season. During the near of the end of the season, the New York Saints defeated the Philadelphia Wings, 8\u20135, before the first sellout and the largest crowd in league history: 17,177 at the Spectrum in Philadelphia. The Saints' victory forced a rematch the next week in the playoffs. However, the Wings won that game and later went on to become the first team to win two league championship games, defeating the New England Blazers, 17\u20137 in front of 11,479 fans.\nThe Major Indoor Lacrosse League later announced that the attendance for 26 total games during the season was 287,585 which was a huge boost, increasing the average attendance a game to 11,060. After the season, the MILL announced the signing of twin brothers, Paul Gait and Gary Gait, 3-time All-Americans at Syracuse to the Detroit Turbos after being drafted (the two brothers won national championships with the Syracuse Orange in 1988, 1989, and 1990).\nThe league prepared to open season five with the same six teams. However, this season schedule increased from 8 to 10 games with each team playing five games at home and five games on the road.\nIn the first game of the regular season, the debut of Detroit rookie twin brothers Paul and Gary Gait was successful, as they paced the Turbos to a 20\u201316 victory over the Baltimore Thunder.\nThe 1991 season was definitely a record-breaking year, especially in Detroit. Rookie twin Turbos, Paul and Gary Gait, set new standards in most offensive categories. Paul scored a record 47 goals, while Gary was second in the league with 32. Gary established new records with 36 assists and 68 points. As a team, Detroit set records for goals scored with 184, assists with 227, and total points with 411.\nThe Detroit Turbos defeated the Baltimore Thunder, 14\u201312, to claim the league's fifth title and the Turbos' first title. The World Championship Game was attended by 10,814 at the Baltimore Arena.\nThe league announced that Buffalo had been named as an expansion team for league play in the 1992 season. The team was named the Bandits, wearing the colors black, orange, and white, and had their home in Memorial Auditorium. The league promoted the team in conjunction with the Buffalo Sabres.\nFinal league attendance numbers for the 1991 season reached 287,654.\nOn April 20, 1991, the National Division All-Stars defeated the American Division All-Stars, 25\u201320, in the inaugural League All-Star Game at the Spectrum in Philadelphia.\nThe league opened the sixth season with seven teams with the expansion Buffalo Bandits joining the league. Each of the seven teams played an eight-game schedule with four home games and four road games.\nThe Buffalo Bandits defeated the Philadelphia Wings, 20\u201311, in their first ever sellout of 16,325 in Memorial Auditorium. It marked the second sellout in league history. The Buffalo Bandits defeated the Baltimore Thunder in front of their second sellout crowd of the season at the Memorial Auditorium, 16,325. It also marked the first time a team sold out two games in the same season.\nThe expansion Buffalo Bandits advanced to the League Championship Game by defeating the Detroit Turbos and the Gait brothers, 19\u201316, to win the National Division crown. The Philadelphia Wings defeated the Saints, 8\u20136, to capture the American Division Championship.\nFor the first time, an expansion team won the league's World Championship, as the Buffalo Bandits defeated the Philadelphia Wings, 11\u201310, in overtime.\nBuffalo won their second consecutive League Championship with a 13\u201312 comeback victory over the Philadelphia Wings before 16,325 in the sold-out Memorial Auditorium. The Bandits kept their 18-game winning streak alive, the longest in professional sports. Buffalo joined the Wings as the only team in league history to win back-to-back championships.\nThe League and the Players Association announced a three-year contract agreement and the league signed a six-year agreement with ESPN.\nESPN2's first Monday night broadcast featured the Detroit Turbos against the Baltimore Thunder.\nThe Philadelphia Wings denied the Buffalo Bandits a third consecutive World Championship by defeating the Bandits, 26\u201315, in front of a sellout crowd of 16,284 at Memorial Auditorium. The win gave the Wings its third League Championship in their history, the most of any league team. ESPN broadcast the game live from Buffalo, marking the first live telecast by ESPN of a league game.\nThe league announced that Rochester, New York, would be awarded an expansion team for the 1995 season.\nThe expansion Rochester Knighthawks won their inaugural game, 12\u20138, against the New York Saints in the War Memorial.\nPhiladelphia broke the league's attendance record as 17,380 fans witnessed the Wings defeat of the Baltimore Thunder in the regular season finale.\nFor the first time in league history, Paul Gait of Rochester played against his twin brother Gary Gait of Philadelphia.\nThe Philadelphia Wings won back-to-back championships by defeating the Rochester Knighthawks, 15\u201314, in a thrilling overtime game. As of 1995, the Wings had won four league titles in their nine-year history.\nBefore the beginning of the 1996 season, the second-to-last season that the NLL would be known as the Major Indoor Lacrosse League, it was announced that the season would be expanded to 10 games. In addition, the Boston Blazers announced their new home in the Fleet Center for 1996. Another big crowd of 16,818, the fourth largest in league history, watched the Wings defeat the Charlotte Cobras at CoreStates Spectrum in Philadelphia. The Wings advanced to their fifth consecutive league championship game by defeating the Boston Blazers, 10\u20138, a week before. That was the final MILL game to be played in the historic arena.\nHowever, the Buffalo Bandits played spoiler to the Wings, and denied them a third consecutive league championship, as Buffalo beat Philadelphia, 15\u201310, in the 1996 league championship game, in front of a sold-out Memorial Auditorium in Buffalo. The Bandits picked up their third championship win, and said goodbye to their own arena, at the culmination of the season.\nThe 11th season opened with three games, including Rochester playing Buffalo at the Bandits' new home, the Marine Midland Arena, in front of a new league record crowd of 18,595 fans. The Knighthawks of Rochester, coached by Barry Powless, later claimed their first MILL championship title in 1997, in front of the second largest crowd in MILL history, 18,055, also played at the Marine Midland Arena.\nIn 1997, the Major Indoor Lacrosse League was reconstituted with a new name, the National Lacrosse League.

Lacrosse League - Wikipedia": {"text": "The Nova Scotia Senior Lacrosse League (NSSLL) is a Senior B box lacrosse league based in Nova Scotia. NSSLL is sanctioned by Lacrosse Nova Scotia.\nLeague members or provincial all-star teams have on occasion advanced to compete in Presidents Cup, the national championship of Senior B box lacrosse in Canada.\nFirst formed in 2001 as the Maritime Senior Mens Lacrosse League, five teams competed in the inaugural season. Original members included Sackville Fighting Orangutans, Dartmouth Bandits, Fredericton Raging Saints, Sackville Wolves and Saint John Storm. Bedford Crossefire(Juniors) were added for the 2002 season giving the all-time high of six teams. After five seasons the league dissolved due to decreasing player numbers.\nThe league was revived for the 2011 season with four teams. In 2014 the league was renamed Nova Scotia Senior Lacrosse League.\nGraduating junior players from the East Coast Junior Lacrosse League (ECJLL) are drafted into the NSSLL via a draft each spring.[1]\nNova Scotia was first represented at the 1973 Presidents' Cup tournament, hosting the five-team championship. Team Nova Scotia went 2-2 in round robin play, just missing a spot in the gold medal game. The first medal for Nova Scotia came in the 1975 Presidents Cup, capturing the silver medal after losing to the Edmonton Fullers in the championship.\nHalifax Olands made two appearances at the national championship in 1976 (0-4) and again in 1978. A 2-3 round robin record in '78 earned Halifax a spot in the bronze medal game, where they lost to the Akwesasne Warriors 14-13.\nIn 1985 Nova Scotia Schooners represented the province in Ladner, British Columbia, failing to medal.\n1988 was the most recent season that Halifax hosted the four-team tournament. Team Nova Scotia last appeared in 1990.\nAfter a 25-year absence at Presidents Cup, Team Nova Scotia[2][3] returned to competition at the 2015[4] tournament in St. Catharines. The Nova Scotia Privateers All-Stars went on to capture 7th Place at the event, defeating Nanaimo Timbermen 15-12.[5]", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Scotia_Senior_Lacrosse_League", "
