{"India - Wikipedia": {"text": "India, officially the Republic of India (IAST: Bh\u0101rat Ga\u1e47ar\u0101jya),[25] is a country in South Asia. It has been the second most populous country since at least 1950, with a current population of over 1.4 billion, and will overtake China to become the most populous country in 2023.[17] India is the seventh-largest country by area, and is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[j] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia.\nModern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[26][27][28]\nTheir long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[29] Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[30]\nBy 1200\u00a0BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest.[31][32] Its evidence today is found in the hymns of the Rigveda. Preserved by a resolutely vigilant oral tradition, the Rigveda records the dawning of Hinduism in India.[33] The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions.[34]\nBy 400\u00a0BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism,[35]\nand Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.[36]\nEarly political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin.[37]\nTheir collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity,[38] but also marked by the declining status of women,[39] and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief.[k][40] In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.[41]\nIn the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism became established on India's southern and western coasts.[42]\nMuslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India's northern plains,[43]\neventually founding the Delhi Sultanate, and drawing northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam.[44]\nIn the 15th century, the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture in south India.[45]\nIn the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised religion.[46]\nThe Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative peace,[47]\nleaving a legacy of luminous architecture.[l][48]\nGradually expanding rule of the British East India Company followed, turning India into a colonial economy, but also consolidating its sovereignty.[49] British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly,[50][51] but technological changes were introduced, and modern ideas of education and the public life took root.[52] A pioneering and influential nationalist movement emerged, which was noted for nonviolent resistance and became the major factor in ending British rule.[53][54] In 1947 the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions,[55][56][57][58] a Hindu-majority Dominion of India and a Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan, amid large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration.[59]\nIndia has been a federal republic since 1950, governed through a democratic parliamentary system. It is a pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India's population grew from 361 million in 1951 to almost 1.4 billion in 2022.[60]\nDuring the same time, its nominal per capita income increased from US$64 annually to US$1,498, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. From being a comparatively destitute country in 1951,[61]\nIndia has become a fast-growing major economy and a hub for information technology services, with an expanding middle class.[62] It has a space programme which includes several planned or completed extraterrestrial missions. Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture.[63]\nIndia has substantially reduced its rate of poverty, though at the cost of increasing economic inequality.[64]\nIndia is a nuclear-weapon state, which ranks high in military expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century.[65]\nAmong the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition,[66]\nand rising levels of air pollution.[67]\nIndia's land is megadiverse, with four biodiversity hotspots.[68] Its forest cover comprises 21.7% of its area.[69] India's wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in India's culture,[70] is supported among these forests, and elsewhere, in protected habitats.\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary (third edition 2009), the name \"India\" is derived from the Classical Latin India, a reference to South Asia and an uncertain region to its east; and in turn derived successively from: Hellenistic Greek India ( \u1f38\u03bd\u03b4\u03af\u03b1); ancient Greek Indos ( \u1f38\u03bd\u03b4\u03cc\u03c2); Old Persian Hindush, an eastern province of the Achaemenid Empire; and ultimately its cognate, the Sanskrit Sindhu, or \"river,\" specifically the Indus River and, by implication, its well-settled southern basin.[71][72] The ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as Indoi (\u1f38\u03bd\u03b4\u03bf\u03af), which translates as \"The people of the Indus\".[73]\nThe term Bharat (Bh\u0101rat; pronounced\u00a0[\u02c8b\u02b1a\u02d0\u027e\u0259t] (listen)), mentioned in both Indian epic poetry and the Constitution of India,[74][75] is used in its variations by many Indian languages. A modern rendering of the historical name Bharatavarsha, which applied originally to North India,[76][77] Bharat gained increased currency from the mid-19th century as a native name for India.[74][78]\nHindustan ([\u0266\u026and\u028a\u02c8sta\u02d0n] (listen)) is a Middle Persian name for India, introduced during the Mughal Empire and used widely since. Its meaning has varied, referring to a region encompassing present-day northern India and Pakistan or to India in its near entirety.[74][78][79]\nBy 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier evolved.[26][27][28] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.[26] After 6500\u00a0BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in what is now Balochistan, Pakistan.[81] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation,[82][81] the first urban culture in South Asia,[83] which flourished during 2500\u20131900\u00a0BCE in what is now Pakistan and western India.[84] Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.[83]\nDuring the period 2000\u2013500\u00a0BCE, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic cultures to the Iron Age ones.[85] The Vedas, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism,[86] were composed during this period,[87] and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain.[85] Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north-west.[86] The caste system, which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure, arose during this period.[88] On the Deccan Plateau, archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation.[85] In South India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period,[89] as well as by nearby traces of agriculture, irrigation tanks, and craft traditions.[89]\nIn the late Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the mahajanapadas.[90][91] The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements, two of which became independent religions. Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar, Mahavira.[92] Buddhism, based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha, attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class; chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India.[93][94][95] In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up renunciation as an ideal,[96] and both established long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the Mauryan Empire.[97] The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent except the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas.[98][99] The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as for Ashoka's renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist dhamma which was a result of his remorse for the mass death toll in the brutal Kalinga War between 262 BC to 261 BC.[100][101]\nThe Sangam literature of the Tamil language reveals that, between 200\u00a0BCE and 200\u00a0CE, the southern peninsula was ruled by the Cheras, the Cholas, and the Pandyas, dynasties that traded extensively with the Roman Empire and with West and Southeast Asia.[102][103] In North India, Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family, leading to increased subordination of women.[104][97] By the 4th and 5th centuries, the Gupta Empire had created a complex system of administration and taxation in the greater Ganges Plain; this system became a model for later Indian kingdoms.[105][106] Under the Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion, rather than the management of ritual, began to assert itself.[107] This renewal was reflected in a flowering of sculpture and architecture, which found patrons among an urban elite.[106] Classical Sanskrit literature flowered as well, and Indian science, astronomy, medicine, and mathematics made significant advances.[106]\nThe Indian early medieval age, from 600 to 1200\u00a0CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity.[108] When Harsha of Kannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647\u00a0CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan.[109] When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal.[109] When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the Pallavas from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south.[109] No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond their core region.[108] During this time, pastoral peoples, whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy, were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.[110] The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.[110]\nIn the 6th and 7th centuries, the first devotional hymns were created in the Tamil language.[111] They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all modern languages of the subcontinent.[111] Indian royalty, big and small, and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well.[112] Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation.[112] By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were felt in South-East Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Brunei, Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia.[113] Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission; South-East Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.[113]\nAfter the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using swift-horse cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia's north-western plains, leading eventually to the establishment of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206.[114] The sultanate was to control much of North India and to make many forays into South India. Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites, the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs.[115][116] By repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north.[117][118] The sultanate's raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenous Vijayanagara Empire.[119] Embracing a strong Shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to control much of peninsular India,[120] and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards.[119]\nIn the early 16th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim rulers,[121] fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors.[122] The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule. Instead, it balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices[123][124] and diverse and inclusive ruling elites,[125] leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule.[126] Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under Akbar, the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status.[125] The Mughal state's economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture[127] and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency,[128] caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets.[126] The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India's economic expansion,[126] resulting in greater patronage of painting, literary forms, textiles, and architecture.[129] Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the Marathas, the Rajputs, and the Sikhs, gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience.[130] Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India.[130] As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs.[131]\nBy the early 18th century, with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred, a number of European trading companies, including the English East India Company, had established coastal outposts.[132][133] The East India Company's control of the seas, greater resources, and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly assert its military strength and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite; these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies.[134][132][135][136] Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annexe or subdue most of India by the 1820s.[137] India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had, but was instead supplying the British Empire with raw materials. Many historians consider this to be the onset of India's colonial period.[132] By this time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and having effectively been made an arm of British administration, the East India Company began more consciously to enter non-economic arenas, including education, social reform, and culture.[138]\nHistorians consider India's modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and the education of citizens. Technological changes\u2014among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph\u2014were introduced not long after their introduction in Europe.[139][140][141][142] However, disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule.[143][144] Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and the direct administration of India by the British government. Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest.[145][146] In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885.[147][148][149][150]\nThe rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks and many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets.[151] There was an increase in the number of large-scale famines,[152] and, despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers, little industrial employment was generated for Indians.[153] There were also salutary effects: commercial cropping, especially in the newly canalled Punjab, led to increased food production for internal consumption.[154] The railway network provided critical famine relief,[155] notably reduced the cost of moving goods,[155] and helped nascent Indian-owned industry.[154]\nAfter World War I, in which approximately one million Indians served,[156] a new period began. It was marked by British reforms but also repressive legislation, by more strident Indian calls for self-rule, and by the beginnings of a nonviolent movement of non-co-operation, of which Mahatma Gandhi would become the leader and enduring symbol.[157] During the 1930s, slow legislative reform was enacted by the British; the Indian National Congress won victories in the resulting elections.[158] The next decade was beset with crises: Indian participation in World War\u00a0II, the Congress's final push for non-co-operation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism. All were capped by the advent of independence in 1947, but tempered by the partition of India into two states: India and Pakistan.[159]\nVital to India's self-image as an independent nation was its constitution, completed in 1950, which put in place a secular and democratic republic.[160] Per the London Declaration, India retained its membership of the Commonwealth, becoming the first republic within it.[161] Economic liberalisation, which began in the 1990s, has created a large urban middle class, transformed India into one of the world's fastest-growing economies,[162] and increased its geopolitical clout. Indian films, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture.[163] Yet, India is also shaped by seemingly unyielding poverty, both rural and urban;[163] by religious and caste-related violence;[164] by Maoist-inspired Naxalite insurgencies;[165] and by separatism in Jammu and Kashmir and in Northeast India.[166] It has unresolved territorial disputes with China[167] and with Pakistan.[167] India's sustained democratic freedoms are unique among the world's newer nations; however, in spite of its recent economic successes, freedom from want for its disadvantaged population remains a goal yet to be achieved.[168]\nIndia accounts for the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the Indian tectonic plate, a part of the Indo-Australian Plate.[169] India's defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian Plate, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west, and later, south and south-east.[169] Simultaneously, the vast Tethyan oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to subduct under the Eurasian Plate.[169] These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth's mantle, both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas.[169] Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast crescent-shaped trough that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment[170] and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain.[171]  The original Indian plate makes its first appearance above the sediment in the ancient Aravalli range, which extends from the Delhi Ridge in a southwesterly direction. To the west lies the Thar Desert, the eastern spread of which is checked by the Aravallis.[172][173][174]\nThe remaining Indian Plate survives as peninsular India, the oldest and geologically most stable part of India. It extends as far north as the Satpura and Vindhya ranges in central India. These parallel chains run from the Arabian Sea coast in Gujarat in the west to the coal-rich Chota Nagpur Plateau in Jharkhand in the east.[176] To the south, the remaining peninsular landmass, the Deccan Plateau, is flanked on the west and east by coastal ranges known as the Western and Eastern Ghats;[177] the plateau contains the country's oldest rock formations, some over one billion years old. Constituted in such fashion, India lies to the north of the equator between 6\u00b0 44\u2032 and 35\u00b0 30\u2032 north latitude[m] and 68\u00b0 7\u2032 and 97\u00b0 25\u2032 east longitude.[178]\nIndia's coastline measures 7,517 kilometres (4,700\u00a0mi) in length; of this distance, 5,423 kilometres (3,400\u00a0mi) belong to peninsular India and 2,094 kilometres (1,300\u00a0mi) to the Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep island chains.[179] According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, the mainland coastline consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores, including cliffs; and 46% mudflats or marshy shores.[179]\nMajor Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, both of which drain into the Bay of Bengal.[180] Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi; the latter's extremely low gradient, caused by long-term silt deposition, leads to severe floods and course changes.[181][182] Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the Krishna, which also drain into the Bay of Bengal;[183] and the Narmada and the Tapti, which drain into the Arabian Sea.[184] Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh.[185] India has two archipelagos: the Lakshadweep, coral atolls off India's south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea.[186]\nIndian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons.[187] The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes.[188][189] The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall.[187] Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, and montane.[190]\nTemperatures in India have risen by 0.7\u00a0\u00b0C (1.3\u00a0\u00b0F) between 1901 and 2018.[191] Climate change in India is often thought to be the cause. The retreat of Himalayan glaciers has adversely affected the flow rate of the major Himalayan rivers, including the Ganges and the Brahmaputra.[192] According to some current projections, the number and severity of droughts in India will have markedly increased by the end of the present century.[193]\nIndia is a megadiverse country, a term employed for 17 countries which display high biological diversity and contain many species exclusively indigenous, or endemic, to them.[195] India is a habitat for 8.6% of all mammal species, 13.7% of bird species, 7.9% of reptile species, 6% of amphibian species, 12.2% of fish species, and 6.0% of all flowering plant species.[196][197] Fully a third of Indian plant species are endemic.[198] India also contains four of the world's 34 biodiversity hotspots,[68] or regions that display significant habitat loss in the presence of high endemism.[n][199]\nAccording to official statistics, India's forest cover is 713,789\u00a0km2 (275,595\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), which is 21.71% of the country's total land area.[69] It can be subdivided further into broad categories of canopy density, or the proportion of the area of a forest covered by its tree canopy.[200] Very dense forest, whose canopy density is greater than 70%, occupies 3.02% of India's land area.[200][201] It predominates in the tropical moist forest of the Andaman Islands, the Western Ghats, and Northeast India. Moderately dense forest, whose canopy density is between 40% and 70%, occupies 9.39% of India's land area.[200][201] It predominates in the temperate coniferous forest of the Himalayas, the moist deciduous sal forest of eastern India, and the dry deciduous teak forest of central and southern India.[202] Open forest, whose canopy density is between 10% and 40%, occupies 9.26% of India's land area.[200][201] India has two natural zones of thorn forest, one in the Deccan Plateau, immediately east of the Western Ghats, and the other in the western part of the Indo-Gangetic plain, now turned into rich agricultural land by irrigation, its features no longer visible.[203]\nAmong the Indian subcontinent's notable indigenous trees are the astringent Azadirachta indica, or neem, which is widely used in rural Indian herbal medicine,[204] and the luxuriant Ficus religiosa, or peepul,[205] which is displayed on the ancient seals of Mohenjo-daro,[206] and under which the Buddha is recorded in the Pali canon to have sought enlightenment.[207]\nMany Indian species have descended from those of Gondwana, the southern supercontinent from which India separated more than 100 million years ago.[208] India's subsequent collision with Eurasia set off a mass exchange of species. However, volcanism and climatic changes later caused the extinction of many endemic Indian forms.[209] Still later, mammals entered India from Asia through two zoogeographical passes flanking the Himalayas.[210] This had the effect of lowering endemism among India's mammals, which stands at 12.6%, contrasting with 45.8% among reptiles and 55.8% among amphibians.[197] Among endemics are the vulnerable[211] hooded leaf monkey[212] and the threatened[213] Beddome's toad[213][214] of the Western Ghats.\nIndia contains 172 IUCN-designated threatened animal species, or 2.9% of endangered forms.[215] These include the endangered Bengal tiger and the Ganges river dolphin. Critically endangered species include: the gharial, a crocodilian; the great Indian bustard; and the Indian white-rumped vulture, which has become nearly extinct by having ingested the carrion of diclofenac-treated cattle.[216] Before they were extensively utilized for agriculture and cleared for human settlement, the thorn forests of Punjab were mingled at intervals with open grasslands that were grazed by large herds of blackbuck preyed on by the Asiatic cheetah; the blackbuck, no longer extant in Punjab, is now severely endangered in India, and the cheetah is extinct.[217] The pervasive and ecologically devastating human encroachment of recent decades has critically endangered Indian wildlife. In response, the system of national parks and protected areas, first established in 1935, was expanded substantially. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act[218] and Project Tiger to safeguard crucial wilderness; the Forest Conservation Act was enacted in 1980 and amendments added in 1988.[219] India hosts more than five hundred wildlife sanctuaries and thirteen\u00a0biosphere reserves,[220] four of which are part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves; twenty-five wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention.[221]\nA parliamentary republic with a multi-party system,[223] it has six\u00a0recognised national parties, including the Indian National Congress (INC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and more than 50\u00a0regional parties.[224] The Congress is considered centre-left in Indian political culture,[225] and the BJP right-wing.[226][227][228] For most of the period between 1950\u2014when India first became a republic\u2014and the late 1980s, the Congress held a majority in the Parliament. Since then, however, it has increasingly shared the political stage with the BJP,[229] as well as with powerful regional parties which have often forced the creation of multi-party coalition governments at the centre.[230]\nIn the Republic of India's first three general elections, in 1951, 1957, and 1962, the Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru-led Congress won easy victories. On Nehru's death in 1964, Lal Bahadur Shastri briefly became prime minister; he was succeeded, after his own unexpected death in 1966, by Nehru's daughter Indira Gandhi, who went on to lead the Congress to election victories in 1967 and 1971. Following public discontent with the state of emergency she declared in 1975, the Congress was voted out of power in 1977; the then-new Janata Party, which had opposed the emergency, was voted in. Its government lasted just over two years. There were two prime ministers during this period; Morarji Desai and Charan Singh. Voted back into power in 1980, the Congress saw a change in leadership in 1984, when Indira Gandhi was assassinated; she was succeeded by her son Rajiv Gandhi, who won an easy victory in the general elections later that year. The Congress was voted out again in 1989 when a National Front coalition, led by the newly formed Janata Dal in alliance with the Left Front, won the elections; that government too proved relatively short-lived, lasting just under two years. There were two prime ministers during this period; V.P. Singh and Chandra Shekhar.[231] Elections were held again in 1991; no party won an absolute majority. The Congress, as the largest single party, was able to form a minority government led by P. V. Narasimha Rao.[232]\nA two-year period of political turmoil followed the general election of 1996. Several short-lived alliances shared power at the centre. The BJP formed a government briefly in 1996; it was followed by two comparatively long-lasting United Front coalitions, which depended on external support. There were two prime ministers during this period; H.D. Deve Gowda and I.K. Gujral. In 1998, the BJP was able to form a successful coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the NDA became the first non-Congress, coalition government to complete a five-year term.[233] Again in the 2004 Indian general elections, no party won an absolute majority, but the Congress emerged as the largest single party, forming another successful coalition: the United Progressive Alliance (UPA). It had the support of left-leaning parties and MPs who opposed the BJP. The UPA returned to power in the 2009 general election with increased numbers, and it no longer required external support from India's communist parties.[234] That year, Manmohan Singh became the first prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru in 1957 and 1962 to be re-elected to a consecutive five-year term.[235] In the 2014 general election, the BJP became the first political party since 1984 to win a majority and govern without the support of other parties.[236] In the 2019 general election, the BJP was victorious again. The incumbent prime minister is Narendra Modi, a former chief minister of Gujarat. On 22 July 2022, Droupadi Murmu was elected India's 15th president and took the oath of office on 25 July 2022.[237]\nIndia is a federation with a parliamentary system governed under the Constitution of India\u2014the country's supreme legal document. It is a constitutional republic. Its democratic functioning has come into question in recent years, with some stating that it has become a mixed regime or electoral autocracy.[239]\nFederalism in India defines the power distribution between the union and the states. The Constitution of India, which came into effect on 26 January 1950,[240] originally stated India to be a \"sovereign, democratic republic;\" this characterisation was amended in 1971 to \"a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic\".[241] India's form of government, traditionally described as \"quasi-federal\" with a strong centre and weak states,[242] has grown increasingly federal since the late 1990s as a result of political, economic, and social changes.[243][244]\nThe Government of India comprises three branches:[245]\nIndia is a federal union comprising 28 states and 8 union territories.[16] All states, as well as the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, Puducherry and the National Capital Territory of Delhi, have elected legislatures and governments following the Westminster system of governance. The remaining five union territories are directly ruled by the central government through appointed administrators. In 1956, under the States Reorganisation Act, states were reorganised on a linguistic basis.[261] There are over a quarter of a million local government bodies at city, town, block, district and village levels.[262]\nIn the 1950s, India strongly supported decolonisation in Africa and Asia and played a leading role in the Non-Aligned Movement.[264] After initially cordial relations with neighbouring China, India went to war with China in 1962, and was widely thought to have been humiliated.[265] This was followed by another military conflict in 1967 in which India successfully repelled Chinese attack.[266] India has had tense relations with neighbouring Pakistan; the two nations have gone to war four times: in 1947, 1965, 1971, and 1999. Three of these wars were fought over the disputed territory of Kashmir, while the fourth, the 1971 war, followed from India's support for the independence of Bangladesh.[267] In the late 1980s, the Indian military twice intervened abroad at the invitation of the host country: a peace-keeping operation in Sri Lanka between 1987 and 1990; and an armed intervention to prevent a 1988 coup d'\u00e9tat attempt in the Maldives. After the 1965 war with Pakistan, India began to pursue close military and economic ties with the Soviet Union; by the late 1960s, the Soviet Union was its largest arms supplier.[268]\nAside from ongoing its special relationship with Russia,[269] India has wide-ranging defence relations with Israel and France. In recent years, it has played key roles in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and the World Trade Organization. The nation has provided 100,000 military and police personnel to serve in 35 UN peacekeeping operations across four continents. It participates in the East Asia Summit, the G8+5, and other multilateral forums.[270] India has close economic ties with countries in South America,[271] Asia, and Africa; it pursues a \"Look East\" policy that seeks to strengthen partnerships with the ASEAN nations, Japan, and South Korea that revolve around many issues, but especially those involving economic investment and regional security.[272][273]\nChina's nuclear test of 1964, as well as its repeated threats to intervene in support of Pakistan in the 1965 war, convinced India to develop nuclear weapons.[275] India conducted its first nuclear weapons test in 1974 and carried out additional underground testing in 1998. Despite criticism and military sanctions, India has signed neither the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty nor the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, considering both to be flawed and discriminatory.[276] India maintains a \"no first use\" nuclear policy and is developing a nuclear triad capability as a part of its \"Minimum Credible Deterrence\" doctrine.[277][278] It is developing a ballistic missile defence shield and, a fifth-generation fighter jet.[279][280] Other indigenous military projects involve the design and implementation of Vikrant-class aircraft carriers and Arihant-class nuclear submarines.[281]\nSince the end of the Cold War, India has increased its economic, strategic, and military co-operation with the United States and the European Union.[282] In 2008, a civilian nuclear agreement was signed between India and the United States. Although India possessed nuclear weapons at the time and was not a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it received waivers from the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, ending earlier restrictions on India's nuclear technology and commerce. As a consequence, India became the sixth de facto nuclear weapons state.[283] India subsequently signed co-operation agreements involving civilian nuclear energy with Russia,[284] France,[285] the United Kingdom,[286] and Canada.[287]\nThe President of India is the supreme commander of the nation's armed forces; with 1.45\u00a0million active troops, they compose the world's second-largest military. It comprises the Indian Army, the Indian Navy, the Indian Air Force, and the Indian Coast Guard.[288] The official Indian defence budget for 2011 was US$36.03\u00a0billion, or 1.83% of GDP.[289] Defence expenditure was pegged at US$70.12\u00a0billion for fiscal year 2022\u201323 and, increased 9.8% than previous fiscal year.[290][291] India is the world's second largest arms importer; between 2016 and 2020, it accounted for 9.5% of the total global arms imports.[292] Much of the military expenditure was focused on defence against Pakistan and countering growing Chinese influence in the Indian Ocean.[293] In May 2017, the Indian Space Research Organisation launched the South Asia Satellite, a gift from India to its neighbouring SAARC countries.[294] In October 2018, India signed a US$5.43\u00a0billion (over \u20b9400\u00a0billion) agreement with Russia to procure four S-400 Triumf surface-to-air missile defence systems, Russia's most advanced long-range missile defence system.[295]\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Indian economy in 2022 was nominally worth $3.46\u00a0trillion; it was the fifth-largest economy by market exchange rates, and is around $11.6\u00a0trillion, the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP).[299] With its average annual GDP growth rate of 5.8% over the past two decades, and reaching 6.1% during 2011\u20132012,[300] India is one of the world's fastest-growing economies.[301] However, the country ranks 139th in the world in nominal GDP per capita and 118th in GDP per capita at PPP.[302] Until 1991, all Indian governments followed protectionist policies that were influenced by socialist economics. Widespread state intervention and regulation largely walled the economy off from the outside world. An acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the nation to liberalise its economy;[303] since then it has moved slowly towards a free-market system[304][305] by emphasising both foreign trade and direct investment inflows.[306] India has been a member of World Trade Organization since 1 January 1995.[307]\nThe 522-million-worker Indian labour force is the world's second-largest, as of 2017[update].[288] The service sector makes up 55.6% of GDP, the industrial sector 26.3% and the agricultural sector 18.1%. India's foreign exchange remittances of US$100\u00a0billion in 2022,[308] highest in the world, were contributed to its economy by 32 million Indians working in foreign countries.[309] Major agricultural products include: rice, wheat, oilseed, cotton, jute, tea, sugarcane, and potatoes.[16] Major industries include: textiles, telecommunications, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, food processing, steel, transport equipment, cement, mining, petroleum, machinery, and software.[16] In 2006, the share of external trade in India's GDP stood at 24%, up from 6% in 1985.[304] In 2008, India's share of world trade was 1.68%;[310] In 2021, India was the world's ninth-largest importer and the sixteenth-largest exporter.[311] Major exports include: petroleum products, textile goods, jewellery, software, engineering goods, chemicals, and manufactured leather goods.[16] Major imports include: crude oil, machinery, gems, fertiliser, and chemicals.[16] Between 2001 and 2011, the contribution of petrochemical and engineering goods to total exports grew from 14% to 42%.[312] India was the world's second largest textile exporter after China in the 2013 calendar year.[313]\nAveraging an economic growth rate of 7.5% for several years prior to 2007,[304] India has more than doubled its hourly wage rates during the first decade of the 21st century.[314] Some 431 million Indians have left poverty since 1985; India's middle classes are projected to number around 580\u00a0million by 2030.[315] Though ranking 68th in global competitiveness,[316] as of 2010[update], India ranks 17th in financial market sophistication, 24th in the banking sector, 44th in business sophistication, and 39th in innovation, ahead of several advanced economies.[317] With seven of the world's top 15 information technology outsourcing companies based in India, as of 2009[update], the country is viewed as the second-most favourable outsourcing destination after the United States.[318] India is ranked 40th in the Global Innovation Index in 2022.[319] India's consumer market, the world's eleventh-largest, is expected to become fifth-largest by 2030.[315]\nDriven by growth, India's nominal GDP per capita increased steadily from US$308 in 1991, when economic liberalisation began, to US$1,380 in 2010, to an estimated US$1,730 in 2016. It is expected to grow to US$2,466 by 2022.[20] However, it has remained lower than those of other Asian developing countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, and is expected to remain so in the near future.\nAccording to a 2011 PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) report, India's GDP at purchasing power parity could overtake that of the United States by 2045.[321] During the next four decades, Indian GDP is expected to grow at an annualised average of 8%, making it potentially the world's fastest-growing major economy until 2050.[321] The report highlights key growth factors: a young and rapidly growing working-age population; growth in the manufacturing sector because of rising education and engineering skill levels; and sustained growth of the consumer market driven by a rapidly growing middle-class.[321] The World Bank cautions that, for India to achieve its economic potential, it must continue to focus on public sector reform, transport infrastructure, agricultural and rural development, removal of labour regulations, education, energy security, and public health and nutrition.[322]\nAccording to the Worldwide Cost of Living Report 2017 released by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) which was created by comparing more than 400 individual prices across 160 products and services, four of the cheapest cities were in India: Bangalore (3rd), Mumbai (5th), Chennai (5th) and New Delhi (8th).[323]\nIndia's telecommunication industry is the second-largest in the world with over 1.2 billion subscribers. It contributes 6.5% to India's GDP.[324] After the third quarter of 2017, India surpassed the US to become the second largest smartphone market in the world after China.[325]\nThe Indian automotive industry, the world's second-fastest growing, increased domestic sales by 26% during 2009\u20132010,[326] and exports by 36% during 2008\u20132009.[327] At the end of 2011, the Indian IT industry employed 2.8\u00a0million professionals, generated revenues close to US$100\u00a0billion equalling 7.5% of Indian GDP, and contributed 26% of India's merchandise exports.[328]\nThe pharmaceutical industry in India emerged as a global player. As of 2021, with 3000 pharmaceutical companies and 10,500 manufacturing units India is the world's third-largest pharmaceutical producer, largest producer of generic medicines and supply up to 50%\u201460% of global vaccines demand, these all contribute up to US$24.44\u00a0billions in exports and India's local pharmaceutical market is estimated up to US$42\u00a0billion.[329][330] India is among the top 12 biotech destinations in the world.[331][332] The Indian biotech industry grew by 15.1% in 2012\u20132013, increasing its revenues from \u20b9204.4\u00a0billion (Indian rupees) to \u20b9235.24\u00a0billion (US$3.94 billion at June 2013 exchange rates).[333]\nIndia's capacity to generate electrical power is 300 gigawatts, of which 42 gigawatts is renewable.[334] The country's usage of coal is a major cause of greenhouse gas emissions by India but its renewable energy is competing strongly.[335] India emits about 7% of global greenhouse gas emissions. This equates to about 2.5 tons of carbon dioxide per person per year, which is half the world average.[336][337] Increasing access to electricity and clean cooking with liquefied petroleum gas have been priorities for energy in India.[338]\nDespite economic growth during recent decades, India continues to face socio-economic challenges. In 2006, India contained the largest number of people living below the World Bank's international poverty line of US$1.25 per day.[340] The proportion decreased from 60% in 1981 to 42% in 2005.[341] Under the World Bank's later revised poverty line, it was 21% in 2011.[o][343] 30.7% of India's children under the age of five are underweight.[344] According to a Food and Agriculture Organization report in 2015, 15% of the population is undernourished.[345][346] The Mid-Day Meal Scheme attempts to lower these rates.[347]\nA 2018 Walk Free Foundation report estimated that nearly 8\u00a0million people in India were living in different forms of modern slavery, such as bonded labour, child labour, human trafficking, and forced begging, among others.[348] According to the 2011 census, there were 10.1\u00a0million child labourers in the country, a decline of 2.6\u00a0million from 12.6\u00a0million in 2001.[349]\nSince 1991, economic inequality between India's states has consistently grown: the per-capita net state domestic product of the richest states in 2007 was 3.2 times that of the poorest.[350] Corruption in India is perceived to have decreased. According to the Corruption Perceptions Index, India ranked 78th out of 180 countries in 2018 with a score of 41 out of 100, an improvement from 85th in 2014.[351][352]\nEpidemic and pandemic diseases have long been a major factor, including COVID-19 recently.[353]\nWith 1,210,193,422 residents reported in the 2011 provisional census report,[354] India was the world's second-most populous country.[p] Its population grew by 17.64% from 2001 to 2011,[356] compared to 21.54% growth in the previous decade (1991\u20132001).[356] The human sex ratio, according to the 2011 census, is 940 females per 1,000 males.[354] The median age was 28.7 as of 2020[update].[288] The first post-colonial census, conducted in 1951, counted 361\u00a0million people.[357] Medical advances made in the last 50 years as well as increased agricultural productivity brought about by the \"Green Revolution\" have caused India's population to grow rapidly.[358]\nThe average life expectancy in India is at 70 years\u201471.5 years for women, 68.7 years for men.[288] There are around 93 physicians per 100,000 people.[359] Migration from rural to urban areas has been an important dynamic in India's recent history. The number of people living in urban areas grew by 31.2% between 1991 and 2001.[360] Yet, in 2001, over 70% still lived in rural areas.[361][362] The level of urbanisation increased further from 27.81% in the 2001 Census to 31.16% in the 2011 Census. The slowing down of the overall population growth rate was due to the sharp decline in the growth rate in rural areas since 1991.[363] According to the 2011 census, there are 53 million-plus urban agglomerations in India; among them Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad, in decreasing order by population.[364] The literacy rate in 2011 was 74.04%: 65.46% among females and 82.14% among males.[365] The rural-urban literacy gap, which was 21.2 percentage points in 2001, dropped to 16.1 percentage points in 2011. The improvement in the rural literacy rate is twice that of urban areas.[363] Kerala is the most literate state with 93.91% literacy; while Bihar the least with 63.82%.[365]\nAmong speakers of the Indian languages, 74% speak Indo-Aryan languages, the easternmost branch of the Indo-European languages; 24% speak Dravidian languages, indigenous to South Asia and spoken widely before the spread of Indo-Aryan languages and 2% speak Austroasiatic languages or the Sino-Tibetan languages. India has no national language.[366] Hindi, with the largest number of speakers, is the official language of the government.[367][368] English is used extensively in business and administration and has the status of a \"subsidiary official language\";[6] it is important in education, especially as a medium of higher education. Each state and union territory has one or more official languages, and the constitution recognises in particular 22 \"scheduled languages\".\nThe 2011 census reported the religion in India with the largest number of followers was Hinduism (79.80% of the population), followed by Islam (14.23%); the remaining were Christianity (2.30%), Sikhism (1.72%), Buddhism (0.70%), Jainism (0.36%) and others[q] (0.9%).[15] India has the third-largest Muslim population\u2014the largest for a non-Muslim majority country.[369][370]\nIndian cultural history spans more than 4,500 years.[371] During the Vedic period (c.\u20091700\u00a0BCE\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009500\u00a0BCE), the foundations of Hindu philosophy, mythology, theology and literature were laid, and many beliefs and practices which still exist today, such as dh\u00e1rma, k\u00e1rma, y\u00f3ga, and mok\u1e63a, were established.[73] India is notable for its religious diversity, with Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Islam, Christianity, and Jainism among the nation's major religions.[372] The predominant religion, Hinduism, has been shaped by various historical schools of thought, including those of the Upanishads,[373] the Yoga Sutras, the Bhakti movement,[372] and by Buddhist philosophy.[374]\nIndia has a very ancient tradition of art, which has exchanged many influences with the rest of Eurasia, especially in the first millennium, when Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and South-East Asia, the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art.[375]  Thousands of seals from the Indus Valley Civilization of the third millennium BCE have been found, usually carved with animals, but a few with human figures. The \"Pashupati\" seal, excavated in Mohenjo-daro, Pakistan, in 1928\u201329, is the best known.[376][377] After this there is a long period with virtually nothing surviving.[377][378] Almost all surviving ancient Indian art thereafter is in various forms of religious sculpture in durable materials, or coins. There was probably originally far more in wood, which is lost. In north India Mauryan art is the first imperial movement.[379][380][381] In the first millennium CE, Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and South-East Asia, the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art.[382] Over the following centuries a distinctly Indian style of sculpting the human figure developed, with less interest in articulating precise anatomy than ancient Greek sculpture but showing smoothly-flowing forms expressing prana (\"breath\" or life-force).[383][384] This is often complicated by the need to give figures multiple arms or heads, or represent different genders on the left and right of figures, as with the Ardhanarishvara form of Shiva and Parvati.[385][386]\nMost of the earliest large sculpture is Buddhist, either excavated from Buddhist stupas such as Sanchi, Sarnath and Amaravati,[387] or is rock-cut reliefs at sites such as Ajanta, Karla and Ellora. Hindu and Jain sites appear rather later.[388][389] In spite of this complex mixture of religious traditions, generally, the prevailing artistic style at any time and place has been shared by the major religious groups, and sculptors probably usually served all communities.[390] Gupta art, at its peak c.\u2009300\u00a0CE\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009500\u00a0CE, is often regarded as a classical period whose influence lingered for many centuries after; it saw a new dominance of Hindu sculpture, as at the Elephanta Caves.[391][392] Across the north, this became rather stiff and formulaic after c.\u2009800\u00a0CE, though rich with finely carved detail in the surrounds of statues.[393] But in the South, under the Pallava and Chola dynasties, sculpture in both stone and bronze had a sustained period of great achievement; the large bronzes with Shiva as Nataraja have become an iconic symbol of India.[394][395]\nAncient painting has only survived at a few sites, of which the crowded scenes of court life in the Ajanta Caves are by far the most important, but it was evidently highly developed, and is mentioned as a courtly accomplishment in Gupta times.[396][397] Painted manuscripts of religious texts survive from Eastern India about the 10th century onwards, most of the earliest being Buddhist and later Jain. No doubt the style of these was used in larger paintings.[398] The Persian-derived Deccan painting, starting just before the Mughal miniature, between them give the first large body of secular painting, with an emphasis on portraits, and the recording of princely pleasures and wars.[399][400] The style spread to Hindu courts, especially among the Rajputs, and developed a variety of styles, with the smaller courts often the most innovative, with figures such as Nih\u00e2l Chand and Nainsukh.[401][402] As a market developed among European residents, it was supplied by Company painting by Indian artists with considerable Western influence.[403][404] In the 19th century, cheap Kalighat paintings of gods and everyday life, done on paper, were urban folk art from Calcutta, which later saw the Bengal School of Art, reflecting the art colleges founded by the British, the first movement in modern Indian painting.[405][406]\nBhutesvara Yakshis, Buddhist reliefs from Mathura, 2nd century\u00a0CE\nGupta terracotta relief, Krishna Killing the Horse Demon Keshi, 5th century\nElephanta Caves, triple-bust (trimurti) of Shiva, 18 feet (5.5\u00a0m) tall, c.\u2009550\nChola bronze of Shiva as Nataraja (\"Lord of Dance\"), Tamil Nadu, 10th or 11th century.\nJahangir Receives Prince Khurram at Ajmer on His Return from the Mewar Campaign, Balchand,  c.\u20091635\nKrishna Fluting to the Milkmaids, Kangra painting, 1775\u20131785\nMuch of Indian architecture, including the Taj Mahal, other works of Indo-Islamic Mughal architecture,  and South Indian architecture, blends ancient local traditions with imported styles.[407] Vernacular architecture is also regional in its flavours. Vastu shastra, literally \"science of construction\" or \"architecture\" and ascribed to Mamuni Mayan,[408] explores how the laws of nature affect human dwellings;[409] it employs precise geometry and directional alignments to reflect perceived cosmic constructs.[410] As applied in Hindu temple architecture, it is influenced by the Shilpa Shastras, a series of foundational texts whose basic mythological form is the Vastu-Purusha mandala, a square that embodied the \"absolute\".[411] The Taj Mahal, built in Agra between 1631 and 1648 by orders of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, has been described in the UNESCO World Heritage List as \"the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage\".[412] Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture, developed by the British in the late 19th century, drew on Indo-Islamic architecture.[413]\nThe earliest literature in India, composed between 1500\u00a0BCE and 1200\u00a0CE, was in the Sanskrit language.[414] Major works of Sanskrit literature include the Rigveda (c.\u20091500\u00a0BCE\u00a0\u2013 c.\u20091200\u00a0BCE), the epics: Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata (c.\u2009400\u00a0BCE\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009400\u00a0CE) and the Ramayana (c.\u2009300\u00a0BCE and later); Abhij\u00f1\u0101na\u015b\u0101kuntalam (The Recognition of \u015aakuntal\u0101, and other dramas of K\u0101lid\u0101sa (c.\u20095th century\u00a0CE) and Mah\u0101k\u0101vya poetry.[415][416][417] In Tamil literature, the Sangam literature (c.\u2009600\u00a0BCE\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009300\u00a0BCE) consisting of 2,381 poems, composed by 473 poets, is the earliest work.[418][419][420][421] From the 14th to the 18th centuries, India's literary traditions went through a period of drastic change because of the emergence of devotional poets like Kab\u012br, Tuls\u012bd\u0101s, and Guru N\u0101nak. This period was characterised by a varied and wide spectrum of thought and expression; as a consequence, medieval Indian literary works differed significantly from classical traditions.[422] In the 19th century, Indian writers took a new interest in social questions and psychological descriptions. In the 20th century, Indian literature was influenced by the works of the Bengali poet, author and philosopher Rabindranath Tagore,[423] who was a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature.\nIndian music ranges over various traditions and regional styles. Classical music encompasses two genres and their various folk offshoots: the northern Hindustani and the southern Carnatic schools.[424] Regionalised popular forms include filmi and folk music; the syncretic tradition of the bauls is a well-known form of the latter. Indian dance also features diverse folk and classical forms. Among the better-known folk dances are: the bhangra of Punjab, the bihu of Assam, the Jhumair and chhau of Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal, garba and dandiya of Gujarat, ghoomar of Rajasthan, and the lavani of Maharashtra. Eight dance forms, many with narrative forms and mythological elements, have been accorded classical dance status by India's National Academy of Music, Dance, and Drama. These are: bharatanatyam of the state of Tamil Nadu, kathak of Uttar Pradesh, kathakali and mohiniyattam of Kerala, kuchipudi of Andhra Pradesh, manipuri of Manipur, odissi of Odisha, and the sattriya of Assam.[425]\nTheatre in India melds music, dance, and improvised or written dialogue.[426] Often based on Hindu mythology, but also borrowing from medieval romances or social and political events, Indian theatre includes: the bhavai of Gujarat, the jatra of West Bengal, the nautanki and ramlila of North India, tamasha of Maharashtra, burrakatha of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, terukkuttu of Tamil Nadu, and the yakshagana of Karnataka.[427] India has a theatre training institute the National School of Drama (NSD) that is situated at New Delhi It is an autonomous organisation under the Ministry of culture, Government of India.[428]\nThe Indian film industry produces the world's most-watched cinema.[429] Established regional cinematic traditions exist in the Assamese, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marathi, Odia, Tamil, and Telugu languages.[430] The Hindi language film industry (Bollywood) is the largest sector representing 43% of box office revenue, followed by the South Indian Telugu and Tamil film industries which represent 36% combined.[431]\nTelevision broadcasting began in India in 1959 as a state-run medium of communication and expanded slowly for more than two decades.[432][433] The state monopoly on television broadcast ended in the 1990s. Since then, satellite channels have increasingly shaped the popular culture of Indian society.[434] Today, television is the most penetrative media in India; industry estimates indicate that as of 2012[update] there are over 554 million TV consumers, 462\u00a0million with satellite or cable connections compared to other forms of mass media such as the press (350\u00a0million), radio (156\u00a0million) or internet (37\u00a0million).[435]\nTraditional Indian society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy. The Indian caste system embodies much of the social stratification and many of the social restrictions found on the Indian subcontinent. Social classes are defined by thousands of endogamous hereditary groups, often termed as j\u0101tis, or \"castes\".[436] India abolished untouchability in 1950 with the adoption of the constitution and has since enacted other anti-discriminatory laws and social welfare initiatives.\nFamily values are important in the Indian tradition, and multi-generational patrilineal joint families have been the norm in India, though nuclear families are becoming common in urban areas.[437] An overwhelming majority of Indians, with their consent, have their marriages arranged by their parents or other family elders.[438] Marriage is thought to be for life,[438] and the divorce rate is extremely low,[439] with less than one in a thousand marriages ending in divorce.[440] Child marriages are common, especially in rural areas; many women wed before reaching 18, which is their legal marriageable age.[441] Female infanticide in India, and lately female foeticide, have created skewed gender ratios; the number of missing women in the country quadrupled from 15 million to 63 million in the 50-year period ending in 2014, faster than the population growth during the same period, and constituting 20 percent of India's female electorate.[442] Accord to an Indian government study, an additional 21 million girls are unwanted and do not receive adequate care.[443] Despite a government ban on sex-selective foeticide, the practice remains commonplace in India, the result of a preference for boys in a patriarchal society.[444] The payment of dowry, although illegal, remains widespread across class lines.[445] Deaths resulting from dowry, mostly from bride burning, are on the rise, despite stringent anti-dowry laws.[446]\nMany Indian festivals are religious in origin. The best known include: Diwali, Ganesh Chaturthi, Thai Pongal, Holi, Durga Puja, Eid ul-Fitr, Bakr-Id, Christmas, and Vaisakhi.[447][448]\nIn the 2011 census, about 73% of the population was literate, with 81% for men and 65% for women. This compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41%, 53% and 29%. In 1951 the rates were 18%, 27% and 9%. In 1921 the rates 7%, 12% and 2%. In 1891 they were 5%, 9% and 1%,[449][450] According to Latika Chaudhary, in 1911 there were under three primary schools for every ten villages. Statistically, more caste and religious diversity reduced private spending. Primary schools taught literacy, so local diversity limited its growth.[451]\nThe education system of India is the world's second-largest.[452] India has over 900 universities, 40,000 colleges[453] and 1.5 million schools.[454] In India's higher education system, a significant number of seats are reserved under affirmative action policies for the historically disadvantaged. In recent decades India's improved education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic development.[455][456]\nFrom ancient times until the advent of the modern, the most widely worn traditional dress in India was draped.[457] For women it took the form of a sari, a single piece of cloth many yards long.[457] The sari was traditionally wrapped around the lower body and the shoulder.[457] In its modern form, it is combined with an underskirt, or Indian petticoat, and tucked in the waist band for more secure fastening. It is also commonly worn with an Indian blouse, or choli, which serves as the primary upper-body garment, the sari's end\u2014passing over the shoulder\u2014serving to cover the midriff and obscure the upper body's contours.[457] For men, a similar but shorter length of cloth, the dhoti, has served as a lower-body garment.[458]\nThe use of stitched clothes became widespread after Muslim rule was established at first by the Delhi sultanate (ca 1300 CE) and then continued by the Mughal Empire (ca 1525 CE).[459] Among the garments introduced during this time and still commonly worn are: the shalwars and pyjamas, both styles of trousers, and the tunics kurta and kameez.[459] In southern India, the traditional draped garments were to see much longer continuous use.[459]\nShalwars are atypically wide at the waist but narrow to a cuffed bottom. They are held up by a drawstring, which causes them to become pleated around the waist.[460] The pants can be wide and baggy, or they can be cut quite narrow, on the bias, in which case they are called churidars. When they are ordinarily wide at the waist and their bottoms are hemmed but not cuffed, they are called pyjamas. The kameez is a long shirt or tunic,[461] its side seams left open below the waist-line.[462] The kurta is traditionally collarless and made of cotton or silk; it is worn plain or with embroidered decoration, such as chikan; and typically falls to either just above or just below the wearer's knees.[463]\nIn the last 50 years, fashions have changed a great deal in India. Increasingly, in urban northern India, the sari is no longer the apparel of everyday wear, though they remain popular on formal occasions.[464] The traditional shalwar kameez is rarely worn by younger urban women, who favour churidars or jeans.[464] In white-collar office settings, ubiquitous air conditioning allows men to wear sports jackets year-round.[464] For weddings and formal occasions, men in the middle- and upper classes often wear bandgala, or short Nehru jackets, with pants, with the groom and his groomsmen sporting sherwanis and churidars.[464] The dhoti, once the universal garment of Hindu males, the wearing of which in the homespun and handwoven khadi allowed Gandhi to bring Indian nationalism to the millions,[465]\nis seldom seen in the cities.[464]\nThe foundation of a typical Indian meal is a cereal cooked in a plain fashion and complemented with flavourful savoury dishes.[466] The cooked cereal could be steamed rice; chapati, a thin unleavened bread made from wheat flour, or occasionally cornmeal, and griddle-cooked dry;[467] the idli, a steamed breakfast cake, or dosa, a griddled pancake, both leavened and made from a batter of rice- and gram meal.[468] The savoury dishes might include lentils, pulses and vegetables commonly spiced with ginger and garlic, but also with a combination of spices that may include coriander, cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, cardamon and others as informed by culinary conventions.[466] They might also include poultry, fish, or meat dishes. In some instances, the ingredients might be mixed during the process of cooking.[469]\nA platter, or thali, used for eating usually has a central place reserved for the cooked cereal, and peripheral ones for the flavourful accompaniments, which are often served in small bowls. The cereal and its accompaniments are eaten simultaneously rather than a piecemeal manner. This is accomplished by mixing\u2014for example of rice and lentils\u2014or folding, wrapping, scooping or dipping\u2014such as chapati and cooked vegetables or lentils.[466]\nIndia has distinctive vegetarian cuisines, each a feature of the geographical and cultural histories of its adherents.[471] The appearance of ahimsa, or the avoidance of violence toward all forms of life in many religious orders early in Indian history, especially Upanishadic Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, is thought to have contributed to the predominance of vegetarianism among a large segment of India's Hindu population, especially in southern India, Gujarat, the Hindi-speaking belt of north-central India, as well as among Jains.[471] Although meat is eaten widely in India,  the proportional consumption of meat in the overall diet is low.[472] Unlike China, which has increased its per capita meat consumption substantially in its years of increased economic growth, in India the strong dietary traditions have contributed to dairy, rather than meat, becoming the preferred form of animal protein consumption.[473]\nThe most significant import of cooking techniques into India during the last millennium occurred during the Mughal Empire. Dishes such as the pilaf,[474] developed in the Abbasid caliphate,[475] and cooking techniques such as the marinating of meat in yogurt, spread into northern India from regions to its northwest.[476] To the simple yogurt marinade of Persia, onions, garlic, almonds, and spices began to be added in India.[476] Rice was partially cooked and layered alternately with the sauteed meat, the pot sealed tightly, and slow cooked according to another Persian cooking technique, to produce what has today become the Indian biryani,[476] a feature of festive dining in many parts of India.[477] In the food served in Indian restaurants worldwide the diversity of Indian food has been partially concealed by the dominance of Punjabi cuisine. The popularity of tandoori chicken\u2014cooked in the tandoor oven, which had traditionally been used for baking bread in the rural Punjab and the Delhi region, especially among Muslims, but which is originally from Central Asia\u2014dates to the 1950s, and was caused in large part by an entrepreneurial response among people from the Punjab who had been displaced by the 1947 partition of India.[471]\nSeveral traditional indigenous sports such as kabaddi, kho kho, pehlwani and gilli-danda, and also martial arts such as Kalarippayattu and marma adi, remain popular. Chess is commonly held to have originated in India as chatura\u1e45ga;[479] in recent years, there has been a rise in the number of Indian grandmasters.[480] Viswanathan Anand became the Chess World Champion in 2007 and held the status until 2013.[481] Parcheesi is derived from Pachisi, another traditional Indian pastime, which in early modern times was played on a giant marble court by Mughal emperor Akbar the Great.[482]\nCricket is the most popular sport in India.[483] Major domestic competitions include the Indian Premier League, which is the most-watched cricket league in the world and ranks sixth among all sports leagues.[484] Other professional leagues include the Indian Super League (football) and the Pro Kabaddi league.[485][486][487]\nIndia has won two ODI Cricket world cups, the 1983 edition and the 2011 edition, as well as becoming the inaugural Twenty20 International Cricket Champions in 2007 and has eight field hockey gold medals in the summer olympics[488]\nThe improved results garnered by the Indian Davis Cup team and other Indian tennis players in the early 2010s have made tennis increasingly popular in the country.[489] India has a comparatively strong presence in shooting sports, and has won several medals at the Olympics, the World Shooting Championships, and the Commonwealth Games.[490][491] Other sports in which Indians have succeeded internationally include badminton[492] (Saina Nehwal and P. V. Sindhu are two of the top-ranked female badminton players in the world), boxing,[493] and wrestling.[494] Football is popular in West Bengal, Goa, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and the north-eastern states.[495]\nIndia has hosted or co-hosted several international sporting events: the 1951 and 1982 Asian Games; the 1987, 1996, and 2011 Cricket World Cup tournaments; the 2003 Afro-Asian Games; the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy; the 2009 World Badminton Championships; the 2010 Hockey World Cup; the 2010 Commonwealth Games; and the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup. Major international sporting events held annually in India include the Maharashtra Open, the Mumbai Marathon, the Delhi Half Marathon, and the Indian Masters. The first Formula 1 Indian Grand Prix featured in late 2011 but has been discontinued from the F1 season calendar since 2014.[496] India has traditionally been the dominant country at the South Asian Games. An example of this dominance is the basketball competition where the Indian team won three out of four tournaments to date.[497]\nOverview\nEtymology\nHistory\nGeography\nBiodiversity\nPolitics\nForeign relations and military\nEconomy\nDemographics\nArt\nCulture\nGovernment\nGeneral information\nCoordinates:

surge 36% - Karnataka Assembly Polls 2008": {"text": "According to Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers Association (SIAM), car exports during April-September stood at 2,10,088 units as against 1,54,783 units in the year-ago period.\nThe European Union (EU) nations had incentivised buying of new cars in exchange of the old ones under a scrappage programme in May that will run till February 2010.\nThe growth in exports were largely driven by the country's largest car maker Maruti Suzuki India as its overseas shipments rose over two-fold during April-September to 65,752 units from 29,699 units in the year-ago period, SIAM said.\nHyundai Motor India, the country's largest car exporter Hyundai reported 16.02 per cent jump in exports at 1,39,971 units against 1,20,648 units in the same period last year.\nThere is, however, a question mark on whether car exports can sustain the momentum it witnessed in the first half of the fiscal as the scrappage scheme is subject to the condition that respective governments in the EU have not exhausted their allocated funds till the deadline.\n\n\"The question is whether you will see European car market growing once the scrappage programme is taken back. So we are cautiously optimistic for the export sector in this fiscal,\" SIAM Director General Dilip Chenoy told reporters here.\nAccording to SIAM's latest data, the overall vehicle exports from India grew by 4.41 per cent during the first half of this fiscal at 8,08,455 units as against 7,74,302 units during the same period of last fiscal.\nAll other segments of the industry, however, registered decline in overseas sales in April-September period. During the period, motorcycle exports were down marginally at 4,97,611 units compared with 5,02,031 units.\nTotal two-wheeler exports also fell by 1.30 per cent to 5,12,939 units as against 5,19,684 units in the year-ago period, it added.\nExports of commercial vehicles decreased to 17,466 units in the six months from 27,146 units in the corresponding period in 2008, down 35.66 per cent.\nSIAM said exports of the total passenger vehicles, including utility cars, grew by 34.29 per cent in the six\nmonths at 2,11,645 as against 1,57,601 units in the same period last year.\nIn September, total exports from India rose by 10.03 per cent at 1,53,009.

The new company was created by a merger that was finalised on 1 July 2013, with Bertelsmann initially owning 53% of the joint venture, and Pearson PLC initially owning the remaining 47%.[2] Since 18 December 2019, Penguin Random House has been wholly owned by Bertelsmann.[3]\nPenguin Books has its registered office in City of Westminster, London.[4][5]\nIts British division is Penguin Books Ltd. Other separate divisions are located in the United States, Ireland, New Zealand, India, Australia, Canada, China, Brazil and South Africa.\nPenguin Books Ltd. (est. 1935) of the United Kingdom was bought by Pearson Longman in 1970. In 1975, Penguin acquired the American hardcover firm Viking Press.[6] In 1986, Penguin acquired the New American Library, a mass-market paperback publisher.[7] In 1995, Penguin acquired the independent publisher Donald I. Fine.[8]\nPenguin Group (USA) Inc. was formed in 1996 as a result of the merger between Penguin Books USA and the Putnam Berkley Group after Penguin acquired Putnam Berkley from MCA.[9][10] The newly formed company was originally called Penguin Putnam Inc., but, in 2003, it changed its name to Penguin Group (USA) Inc. to reflect the parent Pearson PLC's grouping of all the Penguin companies worldwide under the supervisory umbrella of Pearson's own Penguin Group division.\nThe different Penguin companies use many imprints, many of which used to be independent publishers.[11] Penguin Group (USA) Inc. also operates its own speaker's bureau that books speaking engagements for many of the publisher's authors. In 2011, the online writing and publishing community Book Country was launched as a subsidiary of Penguin Group USA.[12]\nOn 11 April 2012, the United States Department of Justice filed United States v. Apple Inc., naming Apple, Penguin, and four other major publishers as defendants.  The suit alleged that they conspired to fix prices for e-books and weaken Amazon.com's position in the market in violation of antitrust law.[13] In December 2013, a federal judge approved a settlement of the antitrust claims, in which Penguin and the other publishers paid into a fund that provided credits to customers who had overpaid for books due to the price-fixing.[14]\nOn 26 October 2012, Pearson entered into talks with rival conglomerate Bertelsmann, over the possibility of combining their respective publishing companies, Penguin Group and Random House. The houses were considered two of the 'Big Six' publishing companies prior to the merger,[15] which became the 'Big Five' upon its completion. The European Union approved the Penguin Random House merger on 5 April 2013.\nPenguin Group imprints include the following:[16]", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin_Group", "

Wikipedia": {"text": "South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded to the south by 2,798 kilometres (1,739\u00a0mi) of coastline that stretches along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans;[14][15][16] to the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe; and to the east and northeast by Mozambique and Eswatini. It also completely enclaves the country Lesotho.[17] It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World, and the second-most populous country located entirely south of the equator, after Tanzania. South Africa is a biodiversity hotspot, with unique biomes, plant and animal life. With over 60 million people, the country is the world's 24th-most populous nation and covers an area of 1,221,037 square kilometres (471,445 square miles). Pretoria is the administrative capital, while Cape Town, as the seat of Parliament, is the legislative capital. Bloemfontein has traditionally been regarded as the judicial capital.[18] The largest city, and site of highest court is Johannesburg.\nAbout 80% of the population are Black South Africans.[16] The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (White South Africans), Asian (Indian South Africans and Chinese South Africans), and multiracial (Coloured South Africans) ancestry. South Africa is a multiethnic society encompassing a wide variety of cultures, languages, and religions. Its pluralistic makeup is reflected in the constitution's recognition of 11 official languages, the fourth-highest number in the world.[16] According to the 2011 census, the two most spoken first languages are Zulu (22.7%) and Xhosa (16.0%).[8] The two next ones are of European origin: Afrikaans (13.5%) developed from Dutch and serves as the first language of most Coloured and White South Africans; English (9.6%) reflects the legacy of British colonialism and is commonly used in public and commercial life.\nThe country is one of the few in Africa never to have had a coup d'\u00e9tat, and regular elections have been held for almost a century. However, the vast majority of Black South Africans were not enfranchised until 1994. During the 20th century, the black majority sought to claim more rights from the dominant white minority, which played a large role in the country's recent history and politics. The National Party imposed apartheid in 1948, institutionalising previous racial segregation. After a long and sometimes violent struggle by the African National Congress and other anti-apartheid activists both inside and outside the country, the repeal of discriminatory laws began in the mid-1980s. Since 1994, all ethnic and linguistic groups have held political representation in the country's liberal democracy, which comprises a parliamentary republic and nine provinces. South Africa is often referred to as the \"rainbow nation\" to describe the country's multicultural diversity, especially in the wake of apartheid.[19]\nSouth Africa is a middle power in international affairs; it maintains significant regional influence and is a member of both the Commonwealth of Nations and the G20.[20][21] It is a developing country, ranking 109th on the Human Development Index, the 7th highest on the continent. It has been classified by the World Bank as a newly industrialised country and has the second-largest economy and the most industrialized, technologically advanced economy in Africa overall[22] as well as the 39th-largest economy in the world.[23][24] South Africa has the most UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Africa. Since the end of apartheid, government accountability and quality of life have substantially improved.[25] However, crime, poverty and inequality remain widespread, with about 40% of the total population being unemployed as of 2021[update],[26] while some 60% of the population lived under the poverty line and a quarter under $2.15 a day.[27][28][29]\nThe name \"South Africa\" is derived from the country's geographic location at the southern tip of Africa. Upon formation, the country was named the Union of South Africa in English and Unie van Zuid-Afrika in Dutch, reflecting its origin from the unification of four formerly separate British colonies. Since 1961, the long formal name in English has been the \"Republic of South Africa\" and Republiek van Suid-Afrika in Afrikaans. Since 1994, the country has had an official name in each of its 11 official languages.\nMzansi, derived from the Xhosa noun uMzantsi meaning \"south\", is a colloquial name for South Africa,[30][31] while some Pan-Africanist political parties prefer the term \"Azania\".[32]\nSouth Africa contains some of the oldest archaeological and human-fossil sites in the world.[33][34][35] Archaeologists have recovered extensive fossil remains from a series of caves in Gauteng Province. The area, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, has been branded \"the Cradle of Humankind\". The sites include Sterkfontein, one of the richest sites for hominin fossils in the world, as well as Swartkrans, Gondolin Cave, Kromdraai, Cooper's Cave and Malapa. Raymond Dart identified the first hominin fossil discovered in Africa, the Taung Child (found near Taung) in 1924. Other hominin remains have come from the sites of Makapansgat in Limpopo Province; Cornelia and Florisbad in Free State Province; Border Cave in KwaZulu-Natal Province; Klasies River Caves in Eastern Cape Province; and Pinnacle Point, Elandsfontein and Die Kelders Cave in Western Cape Province.\nThese finds suggest that various hominid species existed in South Africa from about three million years ago, starting with Australopithecus africanus,[36] followed by Australopithecus sediba, Homo ergaster, Homo erectus, Homo rhodesiensis, Homo helmei, Homo naledi and modern humans (Homo sapiens). Modern humans have inhabited Southern Africa for at least 170,000 years. Various researchers have located pebble tools within the Vaal River valley.[37][38]\nSettlements of Bantu-speaking peoples, who were iron-using agriculturists and herdsmen, were present south of the Limpopo River (now the northern border with Botswana and Zimbabwe) by the 4th or 5th century CE. They displaced, conquered, and absorbed the original Khoisan, Khoikhoi and San peoples. The Bantu slowly moved south. The earliest ironworks in modern-day KwaZulu-Natal Province are believed to date from around 1050. The southernmost group was the Xhosa people, whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier Khoisan people. The Xhosa reached the Great Fish River, in today's Eastern Cape Province. As they migrated, these larger Iron Age populations displaced or assimilated earlier peoples. In Mpumalanga Province, several stone circles have been found along with a stone arrangement that has been named Adam's Calendar, and the ruins are thought to be created by the Bakone, a Northern Sotho people.[39][40]\nIn 1487, the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias led the first European voyage to land in southern Africa.[41] On 4 December, he landed at Walfisch Bay (now known as Walvis Bay in present-day Namibia). This was south of the furthest point reached in 1485 by his predecessor, the Portuguese navigator Diogo C\u00e3o (Cape Cross, north of the bay). Dias continued down the western coast of southern Africa. After 8 January 1488, prevented by storms from proceeding along the coast, he sailed out of sight of land and passed the southernmost point of Africa without seeing it. He reached as far up the eastern coast of Africa as, what he called, Rio do Infante, probably the present-day Groot River, in May 1488. On his return he saw the cape, which he named Cabo das Tormentas ('Cape of Storms'). King John II renamed the point Cabo da Boa Esperan\u00e7a, or Cape of Good Hope, as it led to the riches of the East Indies.[42] Dias' feat of navigation was immortalised in Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es' 1572 epic poem Os Lus\u00edadas.\nBy the early 17th century, Portugal's maritime power was starting to decline, and English and Dutch merchants competed to oust Portugal from its lucrative monopoly on the spice trade.[43] Representatives of the British East India Company sporadically called at the cape in search of provisions as early as 1601 but later came to favour Ascension Island and Saint Helena as alternative ports of refuge.[44] Dutch interest was aroused after 1647, when two employees of the Dutch East India Company were shipwrecked at the cape for several months. The sailors were able to survive by obtaining fresh water and meat from the natives.[44] They also sowed vegetables in the fertile soil.[45] Upon their return to Holland, they reported favourably on the cape's potential as a \"warehouse and garden\" for provisions to stock passing ships for long voyages.[44]\nIn 1652, a century and a half after the discovery of the cape sea route, Jan van Riebeeck established a victualling station at the Cape of Good Hope, at what would become Cape Town, on behalf of the Dutch East India Company.[46][47] In time, the cape became home to a large population of vrijlieden, also known as vrijburgers (lit.\u2009'free citizens'), former company employees who stayed in Dutch territories overseas after serving their contracts.[47] Dutch traders also brought thousands of enslaved people to the fledgling colony from Indonesia, Madagascar, and parts of eastern Africa.[48] Some of the earliest mixed race communities in the country were formed between vrijburgers, enslaved people, and indigenous peoples.[49] This led to the development of a new ethnic group, the Cape Coloureds, most of whom adopted the Dutch language and Christian faith.[49]\nThe eastward expansion of Dutch colonists ushered in a series of wars with the southwesterly migrating Xhosa tribe, known as the Xhosa Wars, as both sides competed for the pastureland near the Great Fish River, which the colonists desired for grazing cattle.[50] Vrijburgers who became independent farmers on the frontier were known as Boers, with some adopting semi-nomadic lifestyles being denoted as trekboers.[50] The Boers formed loose militias, which they termed commandos, and forged alliances with Khoisan peoples to repel Xhosa raids.[50] Both sides launched bloody but inconclusive offensives, and sporadic violence, often accompanied by livestock theft, remained common for several decades.[50]\nGreat Britain occupied Cape Town between 1795 and 1803 to prevent it from falling under the control of the French First Republic, which had invaded the Low Countries.[50] After briefly returning to Dutch rule under the Batavian Republic in 1803, the cape was occupied again by the British in 1806.[51] Following the end of the Napoleonic Wars, it was formally ceded to Great Britain and became an integral part of the British Empire.[52] British emigration to South Africa began around 1818, subsequently culminating in the arrival of the 1820 Settlers.[52] The new colonists were induced to settle for a variety of reasons, namely to increase the size of the European workforce and to bolster frontier regions against Xhosa incursions.[52]\nIn the first two decades of the 19th century, the Zulu people grew in power and expanded their territory under their leader, Shaka.[53] Shaka's warfare indirectly led to the Mfecane ('crushing'), in which one to two million people were killed and the inland plateau was devastated and depopulated in the early 1820s.[54][55] An offshoot of the Zulu, the Matabele people created a larger empire that included large parts of the highveld under their king Mzilikazi.\nDuring the early 19th century, many Dutch settlers departed from the Cape Colony, where they had been subjected to British control, in a series of migrant groups who came to be known as Voortrekkers, meaning \"pathfinders\" or \"pioneers\". They migrated to the future Natal, Free State, and Transvaal regions. The Boers founded the Boer republics: the South African Republic, the Natalia Republic, and the Orange Free State.\nThe discovery of diamonds in 1867 and gold in 1884 in the interior started the Mineral Revolution and increased economic growth and immigration. This intensified British efforts to gain control over the indigenous peoples. The struggle to control these important economic resources was a factor in relations between Europeans and the indigenous population and also between the Boers and the British.[56]\nOn 16 May 1876, President Thomas Fran\u00e7ois Burgers of the South African Republic declared war against the Pedi people. King Sekhukhune managed to defeat the army on 1 August 1876. Another attack by the Lydenburg Volunteer Corps was also repulsed. On 16 February 1877, the two parties signed a peace treaty at Botshabelo.[57] The Boers' inability to subdue the Pedi led to the departure of Burgers in favour of Paul Kruger and the British annexation of the South African Republic. In 1878 and 1879 three British attacks were successfully repelled until Garnet Wolseley defeated Sekhukhune in November 1879 with an army of 2,000 British soldiers, Boers and 10,000 Swazis.\nThe Anglo-Zulu War was fought in 1879 between the British and the Zulu Kingdom. Following Lord Carnarvon's successful introduction of federation in Canada, it was thought that similar political effort, coupled with military campaigns, might succeed with the African kingdoms, tribal areas and Boer republics in South Africa. In 1874, Henry Bartle Frere was sent to South Africa as the British High Commissioner to bring such plans into being. Among the obstacles were the presence of the independent states of the Boers, and the Zululand army. The Zulu nation defeated the British at the Battle of Isandlwana. Eventually Zululand lost the war, resulting in the termination of the Zulu nation's independence.\nThe Boer republics successfully resisted British encroachments during the First Boer War (1880\u20131881) using guerrilla warfare tactics, which were well-suited to local conditions. The British returned with greater numbers, more experience, and new strategy in the Second Boer War (1899\u20131902) and, although they suffered heavy casualties through attrition, they were ultimately successful. Over 27,000 Boer women and children died in the British concentration camps.[58]\nSouth Africa's urban population grew rapidly from the end of the 19th century onward. After the devastation of the wars, Dutch-descendant Boer farmers fled into cities from the devastated Transvaal and Orange Free State territories to become the class of the white urban poor.[59]\nAnti-British policies among white South Africans focused on independence. During the Dutch and British colonial years, racial segregation was mostly informal, though some legislation was enacted to control the settlement and movement of indigenous people, including the Native Location Act of 1879 and the system of pass laws.[60][61][62][63][64]\nEight years after the end of the Second Boer War and after four years of negotiation, the South Africa Act 1909 granted nominal independence while creating the Union of South Africa on 31 May 1910. The union was a dominion that included the former territories of the Cape, Transvaal and Natal colonies, as well as the Orange Free State republic.[65] The Natives' Land Act of 1913 severely restricted the ownership of land by blacks; at that stage they controlled only 7% of the country. The amount of land reserved for indigenous peoples was later marginally increased.[66]\nIn 1931, the union became fully sovereign from the United Kingdom with the passage of the Statute of Westminster, which abolished the last powers of the Parliament of the United Kingdom to legislate on the country. Only three other African countries\u2014Liberia, Ethiopia, and Egypt\u2014had been independent prior to that point. In 1934, the South African Party and National Party merged to form the United Party, seeking reconciliation between Afrikaners and English-speaking whites. In 1939, the party split over the entry of the union into World War II as an ally of the United Kingdom, a move which the National Party followers strongly opposed.\nIn 1948, the National Party was elected to power. It strengthened the racial segregation begun under Dutch and British colonial rule. Taking Canada's Indian Act as a framework,[67] the nationalist government classified all peoples into three races (Whites, Blacks, Indians and Coloured people (people of mixed race)) and developed rights and limitations for each. The white minority (less than 20%)[68] controlled the vastly larger black majority. The legally institutionalised segregation became known as apartheid. While whites enjoyed the highest standard of living in all of Africa, comparable to First World Western nations, the black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard, including income, education, housing, and life expectancy.[69] The Freedom Charter, adopted in 1955 by the Congress Alliance, demanded a non-racial society and an end to discrimination.\nOn 31 May 1961, the country became a republic following a referendum (only open to white voters) which narrowly passed;[70] the British-dominated Natal province largely voted against the proposal. Elizabeth II lost the title Queen of South Africa, and the last Governor-General, Charles Robberts Swart, became state president. As a concession to the Westminster system, the appointment of the president remained an appointment by parliament and was virtually powerless until P. W. Botha's Constitution Act of 1983, which eliminated the office of prime minister and instated a unique \"strong presidency\" responsible to parliament. Pressured by other Commonwealth of Nations countries, South Africa withdrew from the organisation in 1961 and rejoined it in 1994.\nDespite opposition to apartheid both within and outside the country, the government legislated for a continuation of apartheid. The security forces cracked down on internal dissent, and violence became widespread, with anti-apartheid organisations such as the African National Congress (ANC), the Azanian People's Organisation, and the Pan-Africanist Congress carrying out guerrilla warfare[71] and urban sabotage.[72] The three rival resistance movements also engaged in occasional inter-factional clashes as they jockeyed for domestic influence.[73] Apartheid became increasingly controversial, and several countries began to boycott business with the South African government because of its racial policies. These measures were later extended to international sanctions and the divestment of holdings by foreign investors.[74][75]\nThe Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith, signed by Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Harry Schwarz in 1974, enshrined the principles of peaceful transition of power and equality for all, the first of such agreements by black and white political leaders in South Africa. Ultimately, F.W. de Klerk opened bilateral discussions with Nelson Mandela in 1993 for a transition of policies and government.\nIn 1990, the National Party government took the first step towards dismantling discrimination when it lifted the ban on the ANC and other political organisations. It released Nelson Mandela from prison after 27 years of serving a sentence for sabotage. A negotiation process followed. With approval from the white electorate in a 1992 referendum, the government continued negotiations to end apartheid. South Africa held its first universal elections in 1994, which the ANC won by an overwhelming majority. It has been in power ever since. The country rejoined the Commonwealth of Nations and became a member of the Southern African Development Community.\nIn post-apartheid South Africa, unemployment remained high. While many blacks have risen to middle or upper classes, the overall unemployment rate of black people worsened between 1994 and 2003 by official metrics but declined significantly using expanded definitions.[76] Poverty among whites, which was previously rare, increased.[77] The government struggled to achieve the monetary and fiscal discipline to ensure both redistribution of wealth and economic growth. The United Nations Human Development Index rose steadily until the mid-1990s[78] then fell from 1995 to 2005 before recovering its 1995 peak in 2013.[79] The fall is in large part attributable to the South African HIV/AIDS pandemic which saw South African life expectancy fall from a high point of 62 years in 1992 to a low of 53 in 2005,[80] and the failure of the government to take steps to address the pandemic in its early years.[81]\nIn May 2008, riots left over 60 people dead.[82] The Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions estimated that over 100,000 people were driven from their homes.[83] The targets were mainly legal and illegal migrants, and refugees seeking asylum, but a third of the victims were South African citizens.[82] In a 2006 survey, the South African Migration Project concluded that South Africans are more opposed to immigration than any other national group.[84] The UN High Commissioner for Refugees in 2008 reported over 200,000 refugees applied for asylum in South Africa, almost four times as many as the year before.[85] These people were mainly from Zimbabwe, though many also come from Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia.[85] Competition over jobs, business opportunities, public services and housing has led to tension between refugees and host communities.[85] While xenophobia in South Africa is still a problem, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in 2011 reported that recent violence had not been as widespread as initially feared.[85] Nevertheless, as South Africa continues to grapple with racial issues, one of the proposed solutions has been to pass legislation, such as the pending Hate Crimes and Hate Speech Bill, to uphold South Africa's ban on racism and commitment to equality.[86][87]\nBy 2020, numerous warnings have been issued that South Africa is heading towards failed state status [88][89][90] with unsustainable government spending, high unemployment, high crime rates, corruption, failing government owned enterprises and collapsing infrastructure.[91][92][93] In 2022, the World Economic Forum said that South Africa risks state collapse and identified five major risks facing the country.[94] The Director-General of the South African Treasury, Dondo Mogajane, has said that, \"SA is showing the signs of a failing state more common in countries like Sierra Leone and Liberia\".[95] Former minister Jay Naidoo has said that South Africa is in serious trouble and is showing signs of a failed state, with record unemployment levels and the fact that many young people will not find a job in their lifetime.[96] Efficient Group chief economist Dawie Roodt said the country is in deep trouble, \"South Africans have been getting poorer for a decade\". He said he is very concerned because \"32 million people get an income from the state. The state cannot afford this anymore\".[97] Neal Froneman, CEO of Sibanye-Stillwater, said that crime is out of control, with 'mafia-style shakedowns' for procurement contracts becoming the norm. \"Government leadership has created this problem and they are doing nothing. The government can't deal with it because it goes against their ideology.\"[98] Professor Eddy Maloka, from the Institute of Risk Management, \"The ANC has left us in a mess. They've turned their crisis into ours... Government has collapsed in areas across the country. We are seeing inner-cities collapse and degenerate\".[99]  Professor David Himbara said that \"South Africa is a classic case of a de facto one-party state with mismanaged institutions and endemic crime and corruption\".[100]\nSouth Africa is in southernmost Africa, with a coastline that stretches more than 2,500\u00a0km (1,553\u00a0mi) and along two oceans (the South Atlantic and the Indian). At 1,219,912\u00a0km2 (471,011\u00a0sq\u00a0mi),[101] South Africa is the 24th-largest country in the world.[102] Excluding the Prince Edward Islands, the country lies between latitudes 22\u00b0 and 35\u00b0S, and longitudes 16\u00b0 and 33\u00b0E. The interior of South Africa consists of a large, in most places almost flat plateau with an altitude of between 1,000\u00a0m (3,300\u00a0ft) and 2,100\u00a0m (6,900\u00a0ft), highest in the east and sloping gently downwards towards the west and north, and slightly so to the south and south-west.[103] This plateau is surrounded by the Great Escarpment[104] whose eastern, and highest, stretch is known as the Drakensberg.[105] Mafadi in the Drakensberg at 3,450\u00a0m (11,320\u00a0ft) is the highest peak. The KwaZulu-Natal\u2013Lesotho international border is formed by the highest portion of the Great Escarpment which reaches an altitude of over 3,000\u00a0m (9,800\u00a0ft).[106]\nThe south and south-western parts of the plateau (at approximately 1,100\u20131,800\u00a0m above sea level) and the adjoining plain below (at approximately 700\u2013800\u00a0m above sea level\u00a0\u2013\u00a0see map on the right) is known as the Great Karoo, which consists of sparsely populated shrubland. To the north, the Great Karoo fades into the more arid Bushmanland, which eventually becomes the Kalahari Desert in the north-west of the country. The mid-eastern and highest part of the plateau is known as the Highveld. This relatively well-watered area is home to a great proportion of the country's commercial farmlands and contains its largest conurbation (Gauteng). To the north of Highveld, from about the 25\u00b0\u00a030'\u00a0S line of latitude, the plateau slopes downwards into the Bushveld, which ultimately gives way to the Limpopo River lowlands or Lowveld.[104]\nThe coastal belt, below the Great Escarpment, moving clockwise from the northeast, consists of the Limpopo Lowveld, which merges into the Mpumalanga Lowveld, below the Mpumalanga Drakensberg (the eastern portion of the Great Escarpment).[107] This is hotter, drier and less intensely cultivated than the Highveld above the escarpment.[104] The Kruger National Park, located in the provinces of Limpopo and Mpumalanga in north-eastern South Africa, occupies a large portion of the Lowveld covering 19,633 square kilometres (7,580 sq mi)[108]\nThe coastal belt below the south and south-western stretches of the Great Escarpment contains several ranges of Cape Fold Mountains which run parallel to the coast, separating the Great Escarpment from the ocean.[109][110] (These parallel ranges of fold mountains are shown on the map, above left. Note the course of the Great Escarpment to the north of these mountain ranges.) The land between the Outeniqua and Langeberg ranges to the south and the Swartberg range to the north is known as the Little Karoo,[104] which consists of semi-desert shrubland similar to that of the Great Karoo, except that its northern strip along the foothills of the Swartberg Mountains has a somewhat higher rainfall and is, therefore, more cultivated than the Great Karoo. The Little Karoo is famous for its ostrich farming around Oudtshoorn. The lowland area to the north of the Swartberg range up to the Great Escarpment is the lowland part of the Great Karoo, which is climatically and botanically almost indistinguishable from the Karoo above the Great Escarpment. The narrow coastal strip between the Outeniqua and Langeberg ranges and the ocean has a moderately high year-round rainfall, which is known as the Garden Route. It is famous for the most extensive areas of forests in South Africa (a generally forest-poor country).\nIn the south-west corner of the country, the Cape Peninsula forms the southernmost tip of the coastal strip which borders the Atlantic Ocean and ultimately terminates at the country's border with Namibia at the Orange River. The Cape Peninsula has a Mediterranean climate, making it and its immediate surrounds the only portion of Sub-Saharan Africa which receives most of its rainfall in winter.[111][112] The coastal belt to the north of the Cape Peninsula is bounded on the west by the Atlantic Ocean and the first row of north\u2013south running Cape Fold Mountains to the east. The Cape Fold Mountains peter out at about the 32\u00b0\u00a0S line of latitude,[110] after which the Great Escarpment bounds the coastal plain. The most southerly portion of this coastal belt is known as the Swartland and Malmesbury Plain, which is an important wheat growing region, relying on winter rains. The region further north is known as Namaqualand,[113] which becomes more arid near the Orange River. The little rain that falls tends to fall in winter,[112] which results in one of the world's most spectacular displays of flowers carpeting huge stretches of veld in spring (August\u2013September).\nSouth Africa also has one offshore possession, the small sub-Antarctic archipelago of the Prince Edward Islands, consisting of Marion Island (290\u00a0km2 or 110\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and Prince Edward Island (45\u00a0km2 or 17\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) (not to be confused with the Canadian province of the same name).\nSouth Africa has a generally temperate climate because it is surrounded by the Atlantic and Indian Oceans on three sides, because it is located in the climatically milder Southern Hemisphere, and because its average elevation rises steadily toward the north (toward the equator) and further inland. This varied topography and oceanic influence result in a great variety of climatic zones. The climatic zones range from the extreme desert of the southern Namib in the farthest northwest to the lush subtropical climate in the east along the border with Mozambique and the Indian Ocean. Winters in South Africa occur between June and August. The extreme southwest has a climate similar to that of the Mediterranean with wet winters and hot, dry summers, hosting the famous fynbos biome of shrubland and thicket. This area produces much of the wine in South Africa and is known for its wind, which blows intermittently almost all year. The severity of this wind made passing around the Cape of Good Hope is particularly treacherous for sailors, causing many shipwrecks. Further east on the south coast, rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year, producing a green landscape. The annual rainfall increases south of the Lowveld, especially near the coast, which is subtropical. The Free State is particularly flat because it lies centrally on the high plateau. North of the Vaal River, the Highveld becomes better watered and does not experience subtropical extremes of heat. Johannesburg, in the centre of the Highveld, is at 1,740\u00a0m (5,709\u00a0ft) above sea level and receives an annual rainfall of 760\u00a0mm (29.9\u00a0in). Winters in this region are cold, although snow is rare.\nThe coldest place on mainland South Africa is Buffelsfontein in the Eastern Cape, where a temperature of \u221220.1\u00a0\u00b0C (\u22124.2\u00a0\u00b0F) was recorded in 2013.[114] The Prince Edward Islands have colder average annual temperatures, but Buffelsfontein has colder extremes. The deep interior of mainland South Africa has the hottest temperatures: a temperature of 51.7\u00a0\u00b0C (125.06\u00a0\u00b0F) was recorded in 1948 in the Northern Cape Kalahari near Upington,[115] but this temperature is unofficial and was not recorded with standard equipment; the official highest temperature is 48.8\u00a0\u00b0C (119.84\u00a0\u00b0F) at Vioolsdrif in January 1993.[116]\nClimate change in South Africa is leading to increased temperatures and rainfall variability. Extreme weather events are becoming more prominent.[117] This is a critical concern for South Africans as climate change will affect the overall status and wellbeing of the country, for example with regards to water resources. Speedy environmental changes are resulting in clear effects on the community and environmental level in different ways and aspects, starting with air quality, to temperature and weather patterns, reaching out to food security and disease burden.[118] According to computer-generated climate modelling produced by the South African National Biodiversity Institute,[119] parts of southern Africa will see an increase in temperature by about 1\u00a0\u00b0C (1.8\u00a0\u00b0F) along the coast to more than 4\u00a0\u00b0C (7.2\u00a0\u00b0F) in the already hot hinterland such as the Northern Cape in late spring and summertime by 2050. The Cape Floral Region is predicted to be hit very hard by climate change. Drought, increased intensity and frequency of fire, and climbing temperatures are expected to push many rare species towards extinction. South Africa has published two national climate change reports in 2011 and 2016.[120] South Africa contributes considerable carbon dioxide emissions, being the 14th largest emitter of carbon dioxide,[121] primarily from its heavy reliance on coal and oil for energy production.[121] As part of its international commitments, South Africa has pledged to peak emissions between 2020 and 2025.[121]\nSouth Africa signed the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity on 4 June 1994 and became a party to the convention on 2 November 1995.[122] It has subsequently produced a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, which was received by the convention on 7 June 2006.[123] The country is ranked sixth out of the world's seventeen megadiverse countries.[124] Ecotourism in South Africa has become more prevalent in recent years, as a possible method of maintaining and improving biodiversity.\nNumerous mammals are found in the Bushveld including lions, African leopards, South African cheetahs, southern white rhinos, blue wildebeest, kudus, impalas, hyenas, hippopotamuses and South African giraffes. A significant extent of the Bushveld exists in the north-east including Kruger National Park and the Sabi Sand Game Reserve, as well as in the far north in the Waterberg Biosphere. South Africa houses many endemic species, among them the critically endangered riverine rabbit (Bunolagus monticullaris) in the Karoo.\nUp to 1945, more than 4,900 species of fungi (including lichen-forming species) had been recorded.[125] In 2006, the number of fungi in South Africa was estimated at 200,000 species but did not take into account fungi associated with insects.[126] If correct, then the number of South African fungi dwarfs that of its plants. In at least some major South African ecosystems, an exceptionally high percentage of fungi are highly specific in terms of the plants with which they occur.[127] The country's Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan does not mention fungi (including lichen-forming fungi).[123]\nWith more than 22,000 different vascular plants, or about 9% of all the known species of plants on Earth,[128] South Africa is particularly rich in plant diversity. The most prevalent biome is the grassland, particularly on the Highveld, where the plant cover is dominated by different grasses, low shrubs, and acacia, mainly camel-thorn (Vachellia erioloba). Vegetation is sparse towards the north-west because of low rainfall. There are numerous species of water-storing succulents, like aloes and euphorbias, in the very hot and dry Namaqualand area. And according to the World Wildlife Fund, South Africa is home to around a third of all succulent species.[129] The grass and thorn savanna turns slowly into a bush savanna towards the north-east of the country, with denser growth. There are significant numbers of baobab trees in this area, near the northern end of Kruger National Park.[130]\nThe fynbos biome, which makes up the majority of the area and plant life in the Cape Floristic Region, is located in a small region of the Western Cape and contains more than 9,000 of those species, or three times more plant species than found in the Amazon rainforest,[131] making it among the richest regions on earth in terms of plant diversity. Most of the plants are evergreen hard-leaf plants with fine, needle-like leaves, such as the sclerophyllous plants. Another uniquely South African flowering plant group is the genus Protea, with around 130 different species. While South Africa has a great wealth of flowering plants, only 1% of the land is forest, almost exclusively in the humid coastal plain of KwaZulu-Natal, where there are also areas of Southern Africa mangroves in river mouths. Even smaller reserves of forests are out of the reach of fire, known as montane forests. Plantations of imported tree species are predominant, particularly the non-native eucalyptus and pine.\nSouth Africa has lost a large area of natural habitat in the last four decades, primarily because of overpopulation, sprawling development patterns, and deforestation during the 19th century. The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 4.94/10, ranking it 112th globally out of 172 countries.[132] South Africa is one of the worst affected countries in the world when it comes to invasion by alien species with many (e.g., black wattle, Port Jackson willow, Hakea, Lantana and Jacaranda) posing a significant threat to the native biodiversity and the already scarce water resources. The original temperate forest found by the first European settlers was exploited until only small patches remained. Currently, South African hardwood trees like real yellowwood (Podocarpus latifolius), stinkwood (Ocotea bullata), and South African black ironwood (Olea capensis) are under strict government protection. Statistics from the Department of Environmental Affairs show a record 1,215 rhinos were killed in 2014.[133] Since South Africa is home to a third of all succulent species (many endemic to the Karoo), it makes it a hotspot for plant poaching, leading to many species to be threatened with extinction.[129]\nSouth Africa is a nation of about 60 million (as of 2021) people of diverse origins, cultures, languages, and religions.[134] The last census was held in 2011, with estimates produced on an annual basis. South Africa is home to an estimated five\u00a0million illegal immigrants, including some three\u00a0million Zimbabweans.[135][136][137] A series of anti-immigrant riots occurred beginning in May 2008.[138][139]\nStatistics South Africa asks people to describe themselves in the census in terms of five racial population groups.[140] The 2011 census figures for these groups were: Black African at 79.2%, White at 8.9%, Coloured at 8.9%, Indian or Asian at 2.5%, and Other/Unspecified at 0.5%.[8]:\u200a21\u200a The first census in 1911 showed that whites made up 22% of the population; this had declined to 16% by 1980.[141]\nSouth Africa hosts a sizeable refugee and asylum seeker population. According to the World Refugee Survey 2008, published by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, this population numbered approximately 144,700 in 2007.[142] Groups of refugees and asylum seekers numbering over 10,000 included people from Zimbabwe (48,400), the DRC (24,800), and Somalia (12,900).[142] These populations mainly lived in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town, and Port Elizabeth.[142]\nSouth Africa has 11 official languages:[143] Zulu, Xhosa, Afrikaans, English, Pedi,[144] Tswana, Southern Sotho, Tsonga, Swazi, Venda, and Southern Ndebele (in order of first language speakers). In this regard it is fourth only to Bolivia, India, and Zimbabwe in number. While all the languages are formally equal, some languages are spoken more than others. According to the 2011 census, the three most spoken first languages are Zulu (22.7%), Xhosa (16.0%), and Afrikaans (13.5%).[8] Although English is recognised as the language of commerce and science, it is only the fourth most common home language, that of only 9.6% of South Africans in 2011; nevertheless, it has become the de facto lingua franca of the nation.[8] Estimates based on the 1991 census suggest just under half of South Africans can speak English.[145] It is the second most commonly spoken language outside of the household, after Zulu.[146]\nNumerous other languages are spoken, or were widely used previously, including Fanagalo, Khoe, Lobedu, Nama, Northern Ndebele, Phuthi, and South African Sign Language.[147] These unofficial languages may be used in certain official uses in limited areas where it has been determined that these languages are prevalent.[citation needed] Many of the unofficial languages of the San and Khoekhoe peoples contain regional dialects stretching northwards into Namibia and Botswana, and elsewhere. These people, who are a physically distinct population from the Bantu people who make up most of the Black Africans in South Africa, have their own cultural identity based on their hunter-gatherer societies. They have been marginalised to a great extent, and the remainder of their languages are in danger of becoming extinct.\nWhite South Africans may also speak European languages, including Italian, Portuguese (also spoken by black Angolans and Mozambicans), Dutch, German, and Greek, while some Indian South Africans and more recent migrants from South Asia speak Indian languages, such as Gujarati, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu. French is spoken by migrants from Francophone Africa.\nAccording to the 2001 census, Christians accounted for 79.8% of the population, with a majority of them being members of various Protestant denominations (broadly defined to include syncretic African-initiated churches) and a minority of Roman Catholics and other Christians. Christian category includes Zion Christian (11.1%), Pentecostal (Charismatic) (8.2%), Roman Catholic (7.1%), Methodist (6.8%), Dutch Reformed (6.7%), and Anglican (3.8%). Members of remaining Christian churches accounted for another 36% of the population. Muslims accounted for 1.5% of the population, Hindus 1.2%,[149] traditional African religions 0.3% and Judaism 0.2%. 15.1% had no religious affiliation, 0.6% were \"other\" and 1.4% were \"unspecified.\"[150][149][151]\nAfrican-initiated churches formed the largest of the Christian groups. It was believed that many of the persons who claimed no affiliation with any organised religion adhered to a traditional African religion. There are an estimated 200,000 traditional healers, and up to 60% of South Africans consult these healers,[152] generally called sangoma ('diviner') or inyanga ('herbalist'). These healers use a combination of ancestral spiritual beliefs and a belief in the spiritual and medicinal properties of local fauna, flora, and funga commonly known as muti ('medicine'), to facilitate healing in clients. Many peoples have syncretic religious practices combining Christian and indigenous influences.[153]\nSouth African Muslims comprise mainly Coloureds and Indians. They have been joined by black or white South African converts as well as those from other parts of Africa.[154] South African Muslims describe their faith as the fastest-growing religion of conversion in the country, with the number of black Muslims growing sixfold, from 12,000 in 1991 to 74,700 in 2004.[154][155]\nThere is a substantial Jewish population, descended from European Jews who arrived as a minority among other European settlers. This population peaked in the 1970s at 120,000, though only around 67,000 remain today, the rest having emigrated, mostly to Israel. Even so, these numbers make the Jewish community in South Africa the twelfth largest in the world.[156]\nThe adult literacy rate in 2007 was 88.7%.[157] South Africa has a three-tier system of education starting with primary school, followed by high school, and tertiary education in the form of (academic) universities and universities of technology. Learners have twelve years of formal schooling, from grade 1 to 12. Grade R, or grade 0, is a pre-primary foundation year.[158] Primary schools span the first seven years of schooling.[159] High school education spans a further five years. The National Senior Certificate examination takes place at the end of grade 12 and is necessary for tertiary studies at a South African university.[158] Public universities are divided into three types: traditional universities, which offer theoretically oriented university degrees; universities of technology (formerly called technikons), which offer vocationally-oriented diplomas and degrees; and comprehensive universities, which offer both types of qualification. There are 23 public universities in South Africa: 11 traditional universities, 6 universities of technology, and 6 comprehensive universities.\nUnder apartheid, schools for black people were subject to discrimination through inadequate funding and a separate syllabus called Bantu Education which only taught skills sufficient to work as labourers.[160]\nIn 2004, South Africa started reforming its tertiary education system, merging and incorporating small universities into larger institutions, and renaming all tertiary education institutions \"university\". By 2015, 1.4\u00a0million students in higher education have been aided by a financial aid scheme which was promulgated in 1999.[161]\nAccording to the South African Institute of Race Relations, the life expectancy in 2009 was 71 years for a white South African and 48 years for a black South African.[162] The healthcare spending in the country is about 9% of GDP.[163] About 84% of the population depends on the public healthcare system,[163] which is beset with chronic human resource shortages and limited resources.[164] About 20% of the population use private healthcare.[165] Only 16% of the population are covered by medical aid schemes;[166] the rest pay for private care out-of-pocket or through in-hospital-only plans.[165] The three dominant hospital groups, Mediclinic, Life Healthcare and Netcare, together control 75% of the private hospital market.[165]\nAccording to the 2015 UNAIDS medical report, South Africa has an estimated seven million people who are living with HIV\u00a0\u2013 more than any other country in the world.[167] In 2018, HIV prevalence\u2014the percentage of people living with HIV\u2014among adults (15\u201349 years) was 20.4%, and in the same year 71,000 people died from an AIDS-related illness.[168]\nA 2008 study revealed that HIV/AIDS infection is distinctly divided along racial lines: 13.6% of blacks are HIV-positive, whereas only 0.3% of whites have the virus.[169] Most deaths are experienced by economically active individuals, resulting in many AIDS orphans who in many cases depend on the state for care and financial support.[170] It is estimated that there are 1,200,000 orphans in South Africa.[170]\nThe link between HIV, a virus spread primarily by sexual contact, and AIDS was long denied by President Thabo Mbeki and his health minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, who insisted that the many deaths in the country are caused by malnutrition, and hence poverty, and not HIV.[171] In 2007, in response to international pressure, the government made efforts to fight AIDS.[172] After the 2009 general elections, President Jacob Zuma appointed Aaron Motsoaledi as the health minister and committed his government to increasing funding for and widening the scope of HIV treatment,[173] and by 2015, South Africa had made significant progress, with the widespread availability of antiretroviral drugs resulted in an increase in life expectancy from 52.1 years to 62.5 years.[174]\nOne online database[175] lists South Africa having more than 12,600 cities and towns. The following are the largest cities and towns in South Africa.\nSouth Africa is a parliamentary republic, but unlike most such republics, the president is both head of state and head of government and depends for his tenure on the confidence of Parliament. The executive, legislature and judiciary are all subject to the supremacy of the Constitution of South Africa, and the superior courts have the power to strike down executive actions and acts of Parliament if they are unconstitutional. The National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament, consists of 400 members and is elected every five years by a system of party-list proportional representation. The National Council of Provinces, the upper house, consists of ninety members, with each of the nine provincial legislatures electing ten members.\nAfter each parliamentary election, the National Assembly elects one of its members as president; hence the president serves a term of office the same as that of the Assembly, normally five years. No president may serve more than two terms in office.[178] The president appoints a deputy president and ministers (each representing a department) who form the cabinet. The National Assembly may remove the president and the cabinet by a motion of no confidence. In the most recent election, held on 8 May 2019, the ANC won 58% of the vote and 230 seats, while the main opposition, the Democratic Alliance, won 21% of the vote and 84 seats. The Economic Freedom Fighters, founded by Julius Malema, former president of the ANC Youth League who was later expelled from the ANC, won 11% of the vote and 44 seats. The ANC has been the governing political party in South Africa since the end of apartheid.[179]\nSouth Africa has no legally defined capital city. The fourth chapter of the constitution states \"The seat of Parliament is Cape Town, but an Act of Parliament enacted in accordance with section 76(1) and (5) may determine that the seat of Parliament is elsewhere.\"[180] The country's three branches of government are split over different cities. Cape Town, as the seat of Parliament, is the legislative capital; Pretoria, as the seat of the president and cabinet, is the administrative capital; and Bloemfontein is the seat of the Supreme Court of Appeal, and has traditionally been regarded as the judicial capital;[18] although the highest court, the Constitutional Court of South Africa has been based in Johannesburg since 1994. Most foreign embassies are located in Pretoria.\nSince 2004, South Africa has had many thousands of popular protests, some violent, making it, according to one academic, the \"most protest-rich country in the world\".[181] There have been numerous incidents of political repression as well as threats of future repression in violation of the constitution, leading some analysts and civil society organisations to conclude that there is or could be a new climate of political repression.[182][183]\nIn 2008, South Africa placed fifth out of 48 sub-Saharan African countries on the Ibrahim Index of African Governance. South Africa scored well in the categories of Rule of Law, Transparency and Corruption, and Participation and Human Rights, but score low in Safety and Security.[184] In 2006, South Africa became the first and only African country to legalise same-sex marriage.[185]\nThe Constitution of South Africa is the supreme rule of law in the country. The primary sources of South African law are Roman-Dutch mercantile law and personal law and English Common law, as imports of Dutch settlements and British colonialism.[186] The first European-based law in South Africa was brought by the Dutch East India Company and is called Roman-Dutch law. It was imported before the codification of European law into the Napoleonic Code and is comparable in many ways to Scots law. This was followed in the 19th century by English law, both common and statutory. After unification in 1910, South Africa had its own parliament which passed laws specific for South Africa, building on those previously passed for the individual member colonies. The judicial system consists of the magistrates' courts, which hear lesser criminal cases and smaller civil cases; the High Court, which has divisions that serve as the courts of general jurisdiction for specific areas; the Supreme Court of Appeal; and the Constitutional Court, which is the highest court.\nAs the Union of South Africa, the country was a founding member of the United Nations (UN), with Prime Minister Jan Smuts writing the preamble to the UN Charter.[187][188] South Africa is one of the founding members of the African Union (AU) and has the third largest economy of all the members. It is a founding member of the AU's New Partnership for Africa's Development. After apartheid ended, South Africa was readmitted to the Commonwealth of Nations. The country is a member of the Group of 77 and chaired the organisation in 2006. South Africa is also a member of the Southern African Development Community, South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone, Southern African Customs Union, Antarctic Treaty System, World Trade Organization, International Monetary Fund, G20, G8+5, and the Port Management Association of Eastern and Southern Africa.\nSouth Africa has played a key role as a mediator in African conflicts over the last decade, such as in Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Comoros, and Zimbabwe.\nPresident Jacob Zuma and Chinese President Hu Jintao upgraded bilateral ties between the two countries in 2010 when they signed the Beijing Agreement which elevated South Africa's earlier \"strategic partnership\" with China to the higher level of \"comprehensive strategic partnership\" in both economic and political affairs, including the strengthening of exchanges between their respective ruling parties and legislatures.[189][190] In 2011, South Africa joined the Brazil-Russia-India-China (BRICS) grouping of countries, identified by Zuma as the country's largest trading partners and also the largest trading partners with Africa as a whole. Zuma asserted that BRICS member countries would also work with each other through the UN, G20, and the India, Brazil South Africa (IBSA) forum.[191]\nThe South African National Defence Force (SANDF) was created in 1994[192][193] as a volunteer military composed of the former South African Defence Force, the forces of the African nationalist groups (uMkhonto we Sizwe and Azanian People's Liberation Army), and the former Bantustan defence forces.[192] The SANDF is subdivided into four branches, the South African Army, the South African Air Force, the South African Navy, and the South African Military Health Service.[194] The SANDF consists of around 75,000 professional soldiers as of 2019.[195] In recent years, the SANDF has become a major peacekeeping force in Africa,[196] and has been involved in operations in Lesotho, the DRC,[196] and Burundi,[196] amongst others. It has also served in multinational UN Peacekeeping forces such as the UN Force Intervention Brigade. In 2022 the nation spent US$3.069 billion on its armed forces which is about 0.86% of the nation's entire GDP which is relatively lower than the international average of 2%. Over the years, defence expenditure has been cut as the nation currently faces no external military threats.[197]\nThe SANDF are often deployed in crime fighting and whenever the South African Police Service (SAPS) are no longer able to control the situation.[198] During the 2021 South African unrest, South Africa's worst violence since the end of apartheid, saw the deployment of 25,000 troops, more than a dozen military helicopters and heavily armed vehicles deployed in the nation's KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng provinces to assist the South African Police in ending the riots and looting, this was one of the nation's largest military deployments since 1994, the largest deployment of troops since the end of apartheid was in March 2020, when 70,000 troops were deployed to enforce the nation's strict lockdown laws to combat the spread of COVID-19.[199]\nSouth Africa has a lot of military bases distributed all over the nation, this includes two naval bases, nine air force bases and the army maintains large bases in all nine provinces of the country.[200]\nThe SANDF mainly uses military equipment made in South Africa, and some equipment are imported from foreign countries, the nation operates many types of weapons, this includes: armored vehicles; attack helicopters; fighter aircraft; frigates; submarines and even cruise missiles.\nThe South African Defence industry is the most advanced on the African continent and one of the most advanced in the non-western world.[201][202] As of 2020 South Africa is the world's 24th largest arms exporter, the only nation in Africa.[203] The nation designs many types of weapons that range from armored fighting vehicles to ballistic missiles, notably the South African-made Ratel IFV which was the world's first wheeled infantry fighting vehicle, the nation also made its own attack helicopter the \"Denel Rooivalk\" which is considered to be one of the most powerful attack helicopters in the world.[204] In recent years a R16 billion ($1bn) contract was signed with the local defence industry which aims to produce 244 new generation Badger infantry combat vehicle's for the SANDF.[205]\nSouth Africa is the only African country to have successfully developed nuclear weapons. It became the first country (followed by Ukraine) with nuclear capability to voluntarily renounce and dismantle its programme and in the process signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1991.[206] South Africa undertook a nuclear weapons programme in the 1970s.[206] According to President F.W. de Klerk, the decision to build a \"nuclear deterrent\" was taken \"as early as 1974 against a backdrop of a Soviet expansionist threat.\"[207] South Africa is alleged to have conducted a nuclear test over the Atlantic in 1979,[208] although this is officially denied; de Klerk maintained that South Africa had \"never conducted a clandestine nuclear test.\"[207] Six nuclear devices were completed between 1980 and 1990 but all were dismantled by 1991.[207] In 2017, South Africa signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.[209]\nAs of 2015, South Africa still possesses 485 pounds of its weapons grade uranium extracted from its nuclear weapons, which is stored in a silver vault at the Pelindaba nuclear research centre near the country's administrative capital Pretoria, and is keeping a \"tight grip on it.\" This is enough weapons grade uranium to fuel half a dozen nuclear bombs, making the country have the ability to easily regain its status as a nuclear-weapons state, however the biggest concern to the United States is that it could be stolen by militants and used to stage the worst terror attack in history.[210] There had been three security breaches at Pelindaba since the end of Apartheid, with a 2007 breach described by a former US official as being \"horrifying\", however, the South African government dismissed the incident as a \"routine burglary\" by thieves who tried but failed to steal computers or civilian nuclear technology.[211]\nLaw enforcement in South Africa is primarily the responsibility of the South African Police Service (SAPS), South Africa's national police force. SAPS is responsible for investigating crime and security throughout the country. The South African Police Service has over 1,154 police stations across the country and over 150,950 officers.[212] In 2023 the Special Task Force (SAPS) placed 9th at the international SWAT competition out of 55 law enforcement teams from across the world making it the best in Africa.[213]\nSouth Africa has the world's largest Private security industry,[214] with over 10,380 private security companies and 2.5 million private security personnel of which over 556,000 are active,[215] making it bigger than the South African Police Force and Military combined.[216] Private security mainly provide assistance to the South African Police Service (SAPS) to combat crime throughout the country. Over the years there has been tremendous growth in the private security industry.[217]\nAs of February 2023 South Africa has the sixth highest crime rate in the world.[218] From April 2017 to March 2018, on average 57 murders were committed each day in South Africa.[219] In the year ended March 2017, there were 20,336 murders and the murder rate was 35.9 per 100,000 \u2013 over five times higher than the global average of 6.2 per 100,000.[220] More than 526,000 South Africans were murdered from 1994 to 2019.[221] Middle-class South Africans seek security in gated communities.[222]  Many emigrants from South Africa state that crime was a major factor in their decision to leave.[223] Crime against the farming community has continued to be a major problem.[224] In an attempt to reduce crime rate, the police arrested over 500 undocumented foreigners in a raid in August 2019.[225] South Africa has a high rape rate, with 43,195 rapes reported in 2014/15, and an unknown number of sexual assaults going unreported.[226] A 2009 survey of 1,738 men in KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape by the Medical Research Council found one in four men admitted to raping someone,[227] and another survey of 4,000 women in Johannesburg by CIET Africa found one in three said they had been raped in the past year.[228] Rape occurs most commonly within relationships, but many men and women say that rape cannot occur in relationships; however, one in four women reported having been abused by an intimate partner.[229] Rapes are also perpetrated by children (some as young as ten).[230] The incidence of child and infant rape is among the highest in the world, largely as a result of the virgin cleansing myth, and a number of high-profile cases (sometimes as young as eight months)[230] have outraged the nation.[231]\nBetween 1994 and 2018, there were more than 500 xenophobic attacks against foreigners in South Africa.[232] The 2019 Johannesburg riots were similar in nature and origin to the 2008 xenophobic riots that also occurred in Johannesburg.[233]\nEach of the nine provinces is governed by a unicameral legislature, which is elected every five years by party-list proportional representation. The legislature elects a premier as head of government, and the premier appoints an Executive Council as a provincial cabinet. The powers of provincial governments are limited to topics listed in the constitution; these topics include such fields as health, education, public housing and transport.\nThe provinces are in turn divided into 52 districts: 8 metropolitan and 44 district municipalities. The district municipalities are further subdivided into 205 local municipalities. The metropolitan municipalities, which govern the largest urban agglomerations, perform the functions of both district and local municipalities.\nSouth Africa has a mixed economy, South Africa's economy is the most industrialized and technologically advanced in Africa respectively,[238] it has the second largest economy in Africa, after Nigeria and the 39th largest in the world. It also has a relatively high gross domestic product (GDP) per capita compared to other countries in sub-Saharan Africa US$16,040 at purchasing power parity as of 2023 ranked 95th. Despite this, South Africa is still burdened by a relatively high rate of poverty and unemployment and is ranked in the top ten countries in the world for income inequality,[239][240][241] measured by the Gini coefficient.\nSouth Africa is ranked 40th by total Wealth, making it the second wealthiest country in Africa, in terms of private wealth South Africa has a private wealth of $651 billion making South Africa's population the richest in Africa followed by Egypt with $307 billion and Nigeria with $228 billion.[242]\nApproximately 55.5% (30.3 million people) of the population is living in poverty at the national upper poverty line while a total of 13.8 million people (25% of the population) are experiencing food poverty.[243]\nIn 2015, 71% of net wealth are held by 10% of the population, whereas 60% of the population held only 7% of the net wealth, and the Gini coefficient was 0.63, whereas in 1996 it was 0.61.[244]\nUnlike most of the world's poor countries, South Africa does not have a thriving informal economy. Only 15% of South African jobs are in the informal sector, compared with around half in Brazil and India and nearly three-quarters in Indonesia. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) attributes this difference to South Africa's widespread welfare system.[246] World Bank research shows that South Africa has one of the widest gaps between per capita GDP versus its Human Development Index ranking, with only Botswana showing a larger gap.[247]\nAfter 1994, government policy brought down inflation, stabilised public finances, and some foreign capital was attracted, however growth was still subpar.[248] From 2004 onward, economic growth picked up significantly; both employment and capital formation increased.[248] During the presidency of Jacob Zuma, the government increased the role of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Some of the biggest SOEs are Eskom, the electric power monopoly, South African Airways (SAA), and Transnet, the railroad and ports monopoly. Some of these SOEs have not been profitable, such as SAA, which has required bailouts totaling R30\u00a0billion ($2.03 billion) over the 20 years preceding 2015.[249]\nPrincipal international trading partners of South Africa\u2014besides other African countries\u2014include Germany, the United States, China, Japan, the United Kingdom and Spain.[150] The 2020 Financial Secrecy Index ranked South Africa as the 58th safest tax haven in the world.[250]\nThe South African agricultural industry contributes around 10% of formal employment, relatively low compared to other parts of Africa, as well as providing work for casual labourers and contributing around 2.6% of GDP for the nation.[251] Due to the aridity of the land, only 13.5% can be used for crop production, and only 3% is considered high potential land.[252]\nIn August 2013, South Africa was ranked as the top African Country of the Future by fDi Intelligence based on the country's economic potential, labour environment, cost-effectiveness, infrastructure, business friendliness, and foreign direct investment strategy.[253]\nSouth Africa has always been a mining powerhouse. In 2006 South Africa was the world\u2019s largest gold producer for almost a century, by the end of 2009 gold mining in South Africa had declined rapidly having produced 205 metric tons (mt) of gold in 2008 compared to 1,000 metric tons produced in 1970 (almost 80% of the world\u2019s mine supply at the time).[254] Despite this, the country still has 6,000 tonnes of gold reserves[255] and is still number 5 in gold production and remains a cornucopia of mineral riches.[256] It is the world's largest producer[257] of chrome, manganese, platinum, vanadium and vermiculite. It is the second largest producer[257] of ilmenite, palladium, rutile and zirconium. It is the world's third largest coal exporter.[258] It is a huge producer of iron ore; in 2012, it overtook India to become the world's third-biggest iron ore supplier to China, the world's largest consumers of iron ore.[259]\nFrom 1995 to 2003, the number of formal jobs decreased and informal jobs increased; overall unemployment worsened.[76] According to data published by the University of Cape Town, between 2017 and the end of 2020, South Africa had lost 56% of its middle-class earners, and the number of ultra-poor who earn below minimum wage had increased by 6.6 million individuals (54%).[260]\nThe government's Black Economic Empowerment policies have drawn criticism from Neva Makgetla, previous lead economist for research and information at the Development Bank of Southern Africa, for focusing \"almost exclusively on promoting individual ownership by black people [which] does little to address broader economic disparities, though the rich may become more diverse.\"[261] Official affirmative action policies have seen a rise in black economic wealth and an emerging black middle class.[262] Other problems include state ownership and interference, which impose high barriers to entry in many areas.[263] Restrictive labour regulations have contributed to the unemployment malaise.[76]\nAlong with many African nations, South Africa has been experiencing a brain drain in the past 20 years[264] and is almost certainly detrimental for the wellbeing of those reliant on the healthcare infrastructure.[265] The skills drain in South Africa tends to demonstrate racial contours given the skills distribution legacy of South Africa and has thus resulted in large white South African communities abroad.[266] However, the statistics which purport to show a brain drain are disputed and also do not account for repatriation and expiry of foreign work contracts. According to several surveys,[267][268] there was a reverse in brain drain following the global financial crisis of 2007\u20132008 and expiration of foreign work contracts. In the first quarter of 2011, confidence levels for graduate professionals were recorded at a level of 84% in a Professional Provident Society survey.[269] Illegal immigrants are involved in informal trading.[270] Many immigrants to South Africa continue to live in poor conditions, and the immigration policy has become increasingly restrictive since 1994.[271]\nHuman Rights Watch reported in August 2019 that foreign national truck drivers were being subjected to deadly attacks carried out by South African truck drivers. The organization urged the South African government to take immediate actions ensuring the safety of the foreign national truck drivers putting up with violence, harassment, intimidation, stoning, bombing, and shooting, by local truck drivers in the country.[272]\nSouth Africa is a tourist destination with the tourist industry accounting for 2.34% of GDP[273] in 2019 followed by a sharp drop in 2020 to 0.81% of GDP[273] due to lack of travel caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The official marketing agency for the country South African Tourism is responsible for marketing South Africa to the world. According to the World Travel & Tourism Council, the tourism industry directly contributed ZAR 102 billion to South African GDP in 2012, and supports 10.3% of jobs in the country.[274] The official national marketing agency of the South African government, with the goal of promoting tourism in South Africa both locally and globally is known as South African Tourism.[275]\nSouth Africa offers both domestic and international tourists a wide variety of options, among others the picturesque natural landscape and game reserves, diverse cultural heritage and highly regarded wines. Some of the most popular destinations include several national parks, such as the expansive Kruger National Park in the north of the country, the coastlines and beaches of the KwaZulu-Natal and Western Cape provinces, and the major cities like Cape Town, Johannesburg and Durban.\nSouth Africa has a total road network of 750,000 kilometres, the largest of any African country and the 10th largest in the world. According to SANRAL, the road network is valued at more than R2.1 trillion. SANRAL manages national roads and has a network of 22 197 kilometres of paved roads. Provinces are responsible for 222 951 kilometres while, according to the DoT, the municipal network is estimated at 275 661 kilometres of the proclaimed network. The rest are unproclaimed gravel roads (mainly serving rural communities) and are therefore not owned or maintained by any road authority. The country has more than 12 million motor vehicles with an average density of 16 motor vehicles per kilometre. The provincial road network is about 222 951 kilometres in length, consisting of 170 837 kilometres of unpaved and 52 114 kilometres of paved roads.[278]\nRail transport in South Africa is an important element of the country's transport infrastructure. All major cities are connected by rail. Transnet Freight Rail mainly operates freight services while PRASA operates commuter services. State-owned utility Transnet Freight Rail is the largest freight rail transport operator on the African continent, the company maintains a rail network of approximately 31,000 kilometres but only 20,900 kilometres of this are in use.[279]\nSouth Africa's railway system is the most developed and largest in Africa as well as the 13th largest in the world, However, freight, passenger and port capacity shortages remain a severe constraint in domestic and regional trade.[280] Coal and iron ore are mainly transported on these lines, the country's rail network carried nearly 230 million tons of freight in 2017 however, this has declined to 179 million tons in 2021.[281]\nSouth Africa has international airports in six cities: Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban, Port Elizabeth, Kimberley and Nelspruit.[282]\nAs of 2021, South Africa had 407 airports, making it the leading country in Africa in terms of airport ownership and the country ranked 20th globally.[283]\nThe four major airports in South Africa are: O.R. Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg, Cape Town International Airport, King Shaka International Airport in Durban and Chief Dawid Stuurman International Airport in Port Elizabeth.\nO.R. Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg is Africa\u2019s largest and busiest airport which receives over 21 million passengers a year.[284] During the 2022 Skytrax World Airport Awards, Cape Town International Airport was voted the best airport on the African continent for the seventh consecutive year, Durban's King Shaka International Airport was voted the second best in Africa and Johannesburg's O.R. Tambo International Airport came third place.[285]\nSouth Africa has a very large energy sector and is currently the only country on the African continent that possesses a Nuclear power plant.[286] The country is the largest producer of electricity on the African continent and it ranks 21st globally.[287] South Africa is the 7th largest coal producer in the world and produces in excess of 248 million tonnes of coal and consumes almost three-quarters of that domestically. Around 77% of South Africa's energy needs are directly derived from coal and 92% of coal consumed on the African continent is mined in South Africa. South Africa is also the world's 14th largest emitter of greenhouse gases.[288]\nThe country's primary electricity generator is Eskom, the utility is the largest producer of electricity in Africa, and is among the top seven utilities in the world in terms of generation capacity and among the top nine in terms of sales.[289] It is the largest of South Africa's state owned enterprises. Eskom generates approximately 95% of electricity in South Africa and operates a number of notable power stations, including the Koeberg Nuclear Power Station in Cape Town, the only nuclear power plant in Africa, Kendal Power Station, the largest dry-cooled power station in the world,[290] as well as Duvha Power Station which became the first power station in the world to be retrofitted with pulse jet fabric filter plants.[291] In 2001 Eskom was named the best electricity utility in the entire world.[292]\nDue to severe mismanagement and corruption at Eskom, the company is R392bn ($22bn) in debt and is unable to meet the demands of the South African power grid.[294] Due to this, Eskom implemented loadshedding, which is periodically switching off electricity to specific power grids in specific time frames. In South Africa, load shedding is done to prevent a failure of the entire system when the demand for electricity strains the capacity of Eskom\u2019s power generating system. Load shedding is characterized by periods of widespread national-level rolling blackouts.[295] Eskom's latest energy availability factor (EAF) data reveals that mismanagement, corruption, poor maintenance, and sabotage caused power station breakdowns.[296] In 2023 the South African Military was deployed to protect Eskom's power stations from sabotage and theft.[297]\nIn 2007 Eskom started the construction of the \"Kusile\" and \"Medupi\" power stations, the two mega power stations will be the largest dry-cooled power stations in the world and among the largest power stations in the world scheduled for completion in 2014.[298] However these power stations have never met their deadline date with only half of their six units completed and operational mainly caused by long delays and massive cost overruns exceeding more than R300 billion ($16bn) for the two power stations combined, and are only expected to be completed by 2024 or 2026.[299]\nSeveral important scientific and technological developments have originated in South Africa. South Africa was ranked 61st in the Global Innovation Index in 2021, up from 63rd in 2019.[300][301][302][303] The first human-to-human heart transplant was performed by cardiac surgeon Christiaan Barnard at Groote Schuur Hospital in December 1967; Max Theiler developed a vaccine against yellow fever, Allan MacLeod Cormack pioneered X-ray computed tomography (CT scan); and Aaron Klug developed crystallographic electron microscopy techniques. Cormack and Klug received Nobel Prizes for their work. Sydney Brenner won most recently, in 2002, for his pioneering work in molecular biology.\nMark Shuttleworth founded an early Internet security company Thawte, that was subsequently bought out by world leader Verisign. It is the expressed objective of the government to transition the economy to be more reliant on high technology, based on the realisation that South Africa cannot compete with Far Eastern economies in manufacturing, nor can the republic rely on its mineral wealth in perpetuity.\nSouth Africa has cultivated a burgeoning astronomy community. It hosts the Southern African Large Telescope, the largest optical telescope in the Southern Hemisphere. South Africa is currently building the Karoo Array Telescope as a pathfinder for the \u20ac1.5\u00a0billion Square Kilometre Array project.[304]\nModes of transport include roads, railways, airports, water, and pipelines for petroleum oil. The majority of people in South Africa use informal minibus taxis as their main mode of transport. Bus rapid transit has been implemented in some cities in an attempt to provide more formalised and safer public transport services. These systems have been widely criticised because of their large capital and operating costs. South Africa has many major ports including Cape Town, Durban, and Port Elizabeth that allow ships and other boats to pass through, some carrying passengers and some carrying petroleum tankers.\nTwo distinctive features of the South African water sector are the policy of free basic water and the existence of water boards, which are bulk water supply agencies that operate pipelines and sell water from reservoirs to municipalities. These features have led to significant problems concerning the financial sustainability of service providers, leading to a lack of attention to maintenance. Following the end of apartheid, the country had made improvements in the levels of access to water as those with access increased from 66% to 79% from 1990 to 2010.[305] Sanitation access increased from 71% to 79% during the same period.[305] However, water supply and sanitation has come under increasing pressure in recent years despite a commitment made by the government to improve service standards and provide investment subsidies to the water industry.[306]\nThe eastern parts of South Africa suffer from periodic droughts linked to the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon.[307] In early 2018, Cape Town, which has different weather patterns to the rest of the country,[307] faced a water crisis as the city's water supply was predicted to run dry before the end of June. Water-saving measures were in effect that required each citizen to use less than 50 litres (13\u00a0US\u00a0gal) per day.[308] Cape Town rejected an offer from Israel to help it build desalination plants.[309][310][311][312]\nThe South African black majority still has a substantial number of rural inhabitants who lead largely impoverished lives. It is among these people that cultural traditions survive most strongly; as blacks have become increasingly urbanised and Westernised, aspects of traditional culture have declined. Members of the middle class, who are predominantly white but whose ranks include growing numbers of Black, Coloured and Indian people,[313] have lifestyles similar in many respects to that of people found in Western Europe, North America and Australasia.\nSouth African art includes the oldest art objects in the world, which were discovered in a South African cave and dated from roughly 75,000 years ago.[314] The scattered tribes of the Khoisan peoples moving into South Africa from around 10,000 BC had their own fluent art styles seen today in a multitude of cave paintings. They were superseded by the Bantu/Nguni peoples with their own vocabularies of art forms. Forms of art evolved in the mines and townships: a dynamic art using everything from plastic strips to bicycle spokes. The Dutch-influenced folk art of the Afrikaner trekboers and the urban white artists, earnestly following changing European traditions from the 1850s onwards, also contributed to this eclectic mix which continues to evolve to this day.\nThe South African media sector is large, and South Africa is one of Africa's major media centres. While the many broadcasters and publications reflect the diversity of the population as a whole, the most commonly used language is English. However, all ten other official languages are represented to some extent or another.\nThere is great diversity in South African music. Black musicians have developed unique styles called Kwaito and Amapiano, that is said to have taken over radio, television, and magazines.[315] Of note is Brenda Fassie, who launched to fame with her song \"Weekend Special\", which was sung in English. More famous traditional musicians include Ladysmith Black Mambazo, while the Soweto String Quartet performs classical music with an African flavour. South Africa has produced world-famous jazz musicians, notably Hugh Masekela, Jonas Gwangwa, Abdullah Ibrahim, Miriam Makeba, Jonathan Butler, Chris McGregor, and Sathima Bea Benjamin. Afrikaans music covers multiple genres, such as the contemporary Steve Hofmeyr, the punk rock band Fokofpolisiekar, and the singer-songwriter Jeremy Loops. South African popular musicians that have found international success include Manfred Mann, Johnny Clegg, rap-rave duo Die Antwoord, rock band Seether and rappers such as AKA, Nasty C and Cassper Nyovest gained notoriety in other avenues like the BET Awards for best African acts.\nAlthough few South African film productions are known outside South Africa, many foreign films have been produced about South Africa. Arguably, the most high-profile film portraying South Africa in recent years was District 9 and its upcoming sequel. Other notable exceptions are the film Tsotsi, which won the Academy Award for Foreign Language Film at the 78th Academy Awards in 2006, as well as U-Carmen e-Khayelitsha, which won the Golden Bear at the 2005 Berlin International Film Festival. In 2015, the Oliver Hermanus film The Endless River became the first South African film selected for the Venice Film Festival.\nSouth African literature emerged from a unique social and political history. One of the first well known novels written by a black author in an African language was Solomon Thekiso Plaatje's Mhudi, written in 1930. During the 1950s, Drum magazine became a hotbed of political satire, fiction, and essays, giving a voice to the urban black culture.\nNotable white South African authors include Alan Paton, who published the novel Cry, the Beloved Country in 1948. Nadine Gordimer became the first South African to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, in 1991. J.M. Coetzee won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2003. When awarding the prize, the Swedish Academy stated that Coetzee \"in innumerable guises portrays the surprising involvement of the outsider.\"[316]\nThe plays of Athol Fugard have been regularly premiered in fringe theatres in South Africa, London (Royal Court Theatre) and New York. Olive Schreiner's The Story of an African Farm (1883) was a revelation in Victorian literature: it is heralded by many as introducing feminism into the novel form.\nBreyten Breytenbach was jailed for his involvement with the guerrilla movement against apartheid. Andr\u00e9 Brink was the first Afrikaner writer to be banned by the government after he released the novel A Dry White Season.\nThe cuisine of South Africa is diverse, and foods from many different cultures and backgrounds are enjoyed by all communities, and especially marketed to tourists who wish to sample the large variety available. The cuisine is mostly meat-based and has spawned the distinctively South African social gathering known as the braai, a variation of the barbecue. South Africa has also developed into a major wine producer, with some of the best vineyards lying in valleys around Stellenbosch, Franschhoek, Paarl and Barrydale.[317]\nSouth Africa's most popular sports are association football, rugby union and cricket.[318] Other sports with significant support are swimming, athletics, golf, boxing, tennis, rugby league, ringball, field hockey, surfing and netball. Although football (soccer) commands the greatest following among the youth, other sports like basketball, judo, softball and skateboarding are becoming increasingly popular amongst the populace.[319]\nAssociation football is the most popular sport in South Africa.[320][321][322] Footballers who have played for major foreign clubs include Steven Pienaar, Lucas Radebe, Philemon Masinga, Benni McCarthy, Aaron Mokoena, and Delron Buckley. South Africa hosted the 2010 FIFA World Cup, and FIFA president Sepp Blatter awarded South Africa a grade 9 out of 10 for successfully hosting the event.[323] Player Benni McCarthy is also a first-team coach for the English football club Manchester United.[324]\nFamous combat sport personalities include Baby Jake Jacob Matlala, Vuyani Bungu, Welcome Ncita, Dingaan Thobela, Corrie Sanders, Gerrie Coetzee, Brian Mitchell and Dricus du Plessis. Durban surfer Jordy Smith won the 2010 Billabong J-Bay Open making him the highest ranked surfer in the world. South Africa produced Formula One motor racing's 1979 world champion Jody Scheckter. Famous active cricket players include Kagiso Rabada, David Miller, Keshav Maharaj, Anrich Nortje, Reeza Hendricks and Faf du Plessis; most also participate in the Indian Premier League.\nSouth Africa has produced numerous world class rugby players, including Francois Pienaar, Joost van der Westhuizen, Danie Craven, Frik du Preez, Naas Botha, Bryan Habana, Eben Etzebeth, Cheslin Kolbe and Siya Kolisi. South Africa has won the Rugby World Cup three times, tying New Zealand for the most Rugby World Cup wins. South Africa first won the 1995 Rugby World Cup, which it hosted. They went on to win the tournament again in 2007 and in 2019. It followed the 1995 Rugby World Cup by hosting the 1996 African Cup of Nations, with the national team Bafana Bafana going on to win the tournament. In 2022, the women's team also won the Women's Africa Cup of Nations, beating Morocco 2\u20131 in the final. It also hosted the 2003 Cricket World Cup, the 2007 World Twenty20 Championship. South Africa's national cricket team, the Proteas, have also won the inaugural edition of the 1998 ICC KnockOut Trophy by defeating West Indies in the final. The 2023 ICC Women's T20 World Cup was hosted in South Africa and the women's team came in second place. South Africa's national blind cricket team also went on to win the inaugural edition of the Blind Cricket World Cup in 1998.\nIn 2004, the swimming team of Roland Schoeman, Lyndon Ferns, Darian Townsend and Ryk Neethling won the gold medal at the Olympic Games in Athens, simultaneously breaking the world record in the 4\u00d7100 Freestyle Relay. Penny Heyns won Olympic Gold in the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games, and more recently, swimmers Tatjana Schoenmaker and Lara van Niekerk have both broken world records and won gold medals at the Olympic and Commonwealth Games. In 2012, Oscar Pistorius became the first double amputee sprinter to compete at the Olympic Games in London. In golf, Gary Player is generally regarded as one of the greatest golfers of all time, having won the Career Grand Slam, one of five golfers to have done so. Other South African golfers to have won major tournaments include Bobby Locke, Ernie Els, Retief Goosen, Tim Clark, Trevor Immelman, Louis Oosthuizen and Charl Schwartzel.\nWorld portal\nCoordinates:

Wikipedia": {"text": "The economy of Brazil is historically the largest in Latin America and the Southern Hemisphere in nominal terms.[28] The Brazilian economy is the third largest in the Americas. The economy is a middle income developing mixed economy.[29] In 2022, according to International Monetary Fund (IMF), Brazil has the 10th largest gross domestic product (GDP) in the world and has the 8th largest purchasing power parity in the world.[30][31][32]\nIn 2022, according to International Monetary Fund (IMF), Brazilian nominal GDP was US$1.894 trillion, the country has a long history of being among the ten largest economies in the world.[33] The GDP per capita was US$8,857 per inhabitant.[34][35]\nThe country is rich in natural resources. From 2000 to 2012, Brazil was one of the fastest-growing major economies in the world, with an average annual GDP growth rate of over 5%. Its GDP surpassed that of the United Kingdom in 2012, temporarily making Brazil the world's sixth-largest economy. However, Brazil's economic growth decelerated in 2013[36] and the country entered a recession in 2014. The economy started to recover in 2017, with a 1% growth in the first quarter, followed by a 0.3% growth in second quarter compared to the same period of the previous year. It officially exited the recession.\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, Brazil was the top country in upward evolution of competitiveness in 2009, gaining eight positions among other countries, overcoming Russia for the first time, and partially closing the competitiveness gap with India and China among the BRICS economies. Important steps taken since the 1990s toward fiscal sustainability, as well as measures taken to liberalize and open the economy, have significantly boosted the country's competitiveness fundamentals, providing a better environment for private-sector development.[37]\nIn 2020, Forbes ranked Brazil as having the 7th largest number of billionaires in the world.[38] Brazil is a member of diverse economic organizations, such as Mercosur, Prosur, G8+5, G20, WTO, Paris Club, Cairns Group, and is advanced to be a permanent member of the OECD.[39]\nFrom a colony focused on primary sector goods (sugar, gold and cotton), Brazil managed to create a diversified industrial base during the 20th century. The steel industry is a prime example of that, with Brazil being the 9th largest steel producer in 2018, and the 5th largest steel net exporter in 2018.[40] Gerdau is the largest producer of long steel in the Americas, owning 337 industrial and commercial units and more than 45,000 employees across 14 countries. Petrobras, the Brazilian oil and gas company, is the most valuable company in Latin America.[41]\nWhen the Portuguese explorers arrived in the 16th century, the native tribes of current-day Brazil totaled about 2.5\u00a0million people and had lived virtually unchanged since the Stone Age. From Portugal's colonization of Brazil (1500\u20131822) until the late 1930s, the Brazilian economy relied on the production of primary products for exports.\nIn the Portuguese Empire, Brazil was a colony subjected to an imperial mercantile policy, which had three main large-scale economic production cycles \u2013 sugar, gold and from the early 19th century on, coffee. The economy of Brazil was heavily dependent on African slave labor until the late 19th century (about 3 million imported African slaves in total). In that period Brazil was also the colony with the largest number of European settlers, most of them Portuguese (including Azoreans and Madeirans) but also some Dutch (see Dutch Brazil), Spaniards, English, French, Germans, Flemish, Danish, Scottish and Sephardic Jews.\nSubsequently, Brazil experienced a period of strong economic and demographic growth.\nIn 2007, with a population of over 209 million and abundant natural resources, Brazil is one of the ten largest markets in the world, producing tens of millions of tons of steel, 26 million tons of cement, 3.5\u00a0million television sets, and 3 million refrigerators. In addition, about 70\u00a0 million cubic meters of petroleum were being processed annually into fuels, lubricants, propane gas, and a wide range of hundreds of petrochemicals.[42][43]\nBrazil has at least 161,500 kilometers of paved roads, more than 150 gigawatts of installed electric power capacity[44] and its real per capita GDP surpassed US$9,800 in 2017.[30][45] Its industrial sector accounts for three-fifths of the Latin American economy's industrial production.[46] The country's scientific and technological development is argued to be attractive to foreign direct investment, in 2019, Brazil occupied the 4th largest destination for foreign investments, behind only the United States, China and Singapore.[47]\nThe agricultural sector, locally called the agroneg\u00f3cio (agro-business), has also been dynamic: for two decades this sector has kept Brazil among the most highly productive countries in areas related to the rural sector.[46] The agricultural sector and the mining sector also supported trade surpluses which allowed for massive currency gains (rebound) and external debt paydown. Due to a downturn in Western economies, Brazil found itself in 2010 trying to halt the appreciation of the real.[48]\nData from the Asian Development Bank and the Tax Justice Network show the untaxed \"shadow\" economy of Brazil is 39% of GDP.[49]\nOne of the most important corruption cases in Brazil concerns the company Odebrecht. Since the 1980s, Odebrecht has spent several billion dollars in the form of bribes to bribe parliamentarians to vote in favour of the group. At the municipal level, Odebrecht's corruption was aimed at \"stimulating privatisations\", particularly in water and sewer management.[50]\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980\u20132021 (with FMI estimates for 2022-2027). Inflation below 5% is in green.[51]\n(in Bil. US$PPP)\n(in US$ PPP)\n(in Bil. US$nominal)\n(in US$ nominal)\n(real)\n(in Percent)\n(in Percent)\n(in\u00a0% of GDP)\nThe service sector is the largest component of the gross domestic product (GDP) at 67.0 percent, followed by the industrial sector at 27.5 percent. Agriculture represents 5.5 percent of GDP (2011).[52] The Brazilian labor force is estimated at 100.77 million of which 10 percent is occupied in agriculture, 19 percent in the industry sector and 71 percent in the service sector.\nBrazil is the world's largest producer of sugarcane, soy, coffee, orange, guaran\u00e1, a\u00e7a\u00ed and Brazil nut; is one of the top 5 producers of maize, papaya, tobacco, pineapple, banana, cotton, beans, coconut, watermelon and lemon; is one of the top 10 world producers of cocoa, cashew, avocado, tangerine, persimmon, mango, guava, rice, sorghum and tomato; and is one of the top 15 world producers of grape, apple, melon, peanut, fig, peach, onion, palm oil and natural rubber.[53]\nIn the production of animal proteins, Brazil is today one of the largest countries in the world. In 2019, the country was the world's largest exporter of chicken meat.[54][55] It was also the second largest producer of beef,[56] the world's third largest producer of milk,[57] the world's fourth largest producer of pork[58] and the seventh largest producer of eggs in the world.[59]\nAgribusiness contributes to Brazil's trade balance, in spite of trade barriers and subsidizing policies adopted by the developed countries.[60]\nIn the space of fifty five years (1950 to 2005), the population of Brazil grew from 51 million to approximately 187\u00a0million inhabitants,[61] an increase of over 2 percent per year. Brazil created and expanded a complex agribusiness sector.[60] However, some of this is at the expense of the environment, including the Amazon.\nThe importance given to the rural producer takes place in the shape of the agricultural and cattle-raising plan and through another specific subsidy program geared towards family agriculture Programa de Fortalecimento da Agricultura Familiar (Pronaf), which guarantees financing for equipment and cultivation and encourages the use of new technology. With regards to family agriculture, over 800 thousand rural inhabitants are assisted by credit, research and extension programs. A special line of credit is available for women and young farmers.[60]\nWith The Land Reform Program, on the other hand, the country's objective is to provide suitable living and working conditions for families who live in areas allotted by the State, an initiative capable of generating jobs. Through partnerships, public policies and international partnerships, the government is working towards guaranteeing infrastructure for the settlements, following the examples of schools and health outlets. The idea is that access to land represents just the first step towards the implementation of a quality land reform program.[60]\nOver 600,000\u00a0km2 of land are divided into approximately five thousand areas of rural property; an agricultural area currently with three borders: the Central-western region (savannah), the northern region (area of transition) and parts of the northeastern region (semi-arid). At the forefront of grain crops, which produce over 110 million tonnes/year, is the soybean, yielding 50\u00a0million tonnes.[60]\nIn the cattle-raising sector, the \"green ox,\" which is raised in pastures, on a diet of hay and mineral salts, conquered markets in Asia, Europe and the Americas, particularly after the \"mad cow disease\" scare period. Brazil has the largest cattle herd in the world, with 198 million heads,[62] responsible for exports of more than US$1\u00a0billion/year.[60]\nA pioneer and leader in the manufacture of short-fiber timber cellulose, Brazil has also achieved positive results within the packaging sector, in which it is the fifth largest world producer. In the foreign markets, it answers for 25 percent of global exports of raw cane and refined sugar; it is the world leader in soybean exports and is responsible for 80 percent of the planet's orange juice, and since 2003, has had the highest sales figures for beef and chicken.[60]\nIn the mining sector, Brazil stands out in the extraction of iron ore (where it is the second world exporter), copper, gold, bauxite (one of the 5 largest producers in the world), manganese (one of the 5 largest producers in the world), tin (one of the largest producers in the world), niobium (concentrates 98% of reserves known to the world) and nickel. In terms of gemstones, Brazil is the world's largest producer of amethyst, topaz, agate and one of the main producers of tourmaline, emerald, aquamarine, garnet and opal.[63][64][65][66][67][68]\nIn 2019, Brazil's figures were as follows: it was the world's largest producer of niobium (88.9 thousand tons);[69] the 2nd largest world producer of tantalum (430 tons);[70] the 2nd largest world producer of iron ore (405 million tons);[71] the 4th largest world producer of manganese (1.74 million tons);[72] the 4th largest world producer of bauxite (34 million tons);[73] the 4th largest world producer of vanadium (5.94 thousand tons);[74] the 5th largest world producer of lithium (2.4 thousand tons);[75] the 6th largest world producer of tin (14 thousand tons);[76] the 8th largest world producer of nickel (60.6 thousand tons);[77] the 8th largest world producer of phosphate (4.7 million tons);[78] the 12th largest world producer of gold (90 tons);[79] the 14th largest world producer of copper (360 thousand tons);[80][81] the 14th largest world producer of titanium (25 thousand tons);[82] the 13th largest world producer of gypsum (3 million tons);[83] the 3rd largest world producer of graphite (96 thousand tons);[84] the 21st largest world producer of sulfur (500 thousand tons);[85] the 9th largest world producer of salt (7.4 million tons);[86] besides having had a chromium production of 200 thousand tons.[81]\nBrazil has the second-largest manufacturing sector in the Americas. Accounting for 28.5 percent of GDP, Brazil's industries range from automobiles, steel and petrochemicals to computers, aircraft, and consumer durables. With increased economic stability provided by the Plano Real, Brazilian and multinational businesses have invested heavily in new equipment and technology, a large proportion of which has been purchased from U.S. firms.\nThe World Bank lists the main producing countries each year, based on the total production value. According to the 2019 list, Brazil has the 13th most valuable industry in the world (US$173.6 billion). In the Americas, it is second only to the United States (2nd place) and Mexico (12th place).[88] In the food industry, in 2019, Brazil was the second largest exporter of processed foods in the world.[89][90][91] In 2016, the country was the 2nd largest producer of pulp in the world and the 8th producer of paper.[92][93][94] In the footwear industry, in 2019, Brazil ranked 4th among world producers.[95][96][97][98] In 2019, the country was the 8th producer of vehicles and the 9th producer of steel in the world.[99][100][101] In 2018, the chemical industry of Brazil was the 8th in the world.[102][103][104] In textile industry, Brazil, although it was among the 5 largest world producers in 2013, is very little integrated in world trade.[105] In the aviation sector, Brazil has Embraer, the third largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, behind Boeing and Airbus.\nBrazil has a diverse and sophisticated services industry as well. During the early 1990s, the banking sector accounted for as much as 16 percent of the GDP. Although undergoing a major overhaul, Brazil's financial services industry provides local businesses with a wide range of products and is attracting numerous new entrants, including U.S. financial firms. On 8 May 2008, the S\u00e3o Paulo Stock Exchange (Bovespa) and the S\u00e3o Paulo-based Brazilian Mercantile and Futures Exchange (BM&F) merged, creating BM&F Bovespa, one of the largest stock exchanges in the world. Also, the previously monopolistic reinsurance sector is being opened up to third-party companies.[106]\nAs of[update] 31 December 2007, there were an estimated 21,304,000 broadband lines in Brazil. Over 75 percent of the broadband lines were via DSL and 10 percent via cable modems.\nProven mineral resources are extensive. Large iron and manganese reserves are important sources of industrial raw materials and export earnings. Deposits of nickel, tin, chromite, uranium, bauxite, beryllium, copper, lead, tungsten, zinc, gold, and other minerals are exploited. High-quality coking-grade coal required in the steel industry is in short supply.\nThe first study into the impact of the Creative Industries on the Brazilian economy was published by FIRJAN.[107] The creative economy in Latin America was termed the \"Orange Economy\"[108] in a publication released by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). This 2013 study valued Brazil's Orange Economy at US$66.87 billion providing 5,280,000 jobs and responsible for US$9.414 million in exports, with the value of creative exports being higher than the US$8.016 million value of coffee exports over the same period.\nA 2021 study into the Intellectual Property Intensive Sectors in the Brazilian Economy[109] was undertaken as part of the National Strategy on Intellectual Property 2021\u20132030.[110] The study found that 450 of the 673 economic classes could be classified as IP-intensive sectors that collectively employed 19.3 million people. The share of GDP between 2014 and 2016 across these economic classes amounted to R$2.1 trillion reais or 44.2% of GDP over this time.\nIn the list of world tourist destinations, in 2018, Brazil was the 48th most visited country, with 6.6 million tourists (and revenues of 5.9 billion dollars). Tourism in South America as a whole is still underdeveloped: in Europe, for example, countries obtain annual tourism figures like $73.7 billion (Spain), receiving 82.7 million tourists or 67.3 billion (France), receiving 89.4 million tourists. While Europe received 710 million tourists in 2018, Asia 347 million and North America 142.2 million, South America received only 37 million, Central America 10.8 million and the Caribbean 25.7 million.[111]\nIn 2017, 20 Brazilian companies were listed in the Forbes Global 2000 list \u2013 an annual ranking of the top 2000 public companies in the world by Forbes magazine based on a combination of sales, assets, profit, and market value.[112] The 20 companies listed were:\nThe Brazilian government has undertaken an ambitious program to reduce dependence on imported petroleum. Imports previously accounted for more than 70% of the country's oil needs but Brazil became self-sufficient in oil in 2006\u20132007. Brazil was the 10th largest oil producer in the world in 2019, with 2.8 million barrels / day. Production manages to supply the country's demand.[113] In the beginning of 2020, in the production of oil and natural gas, the country exceeded 4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, for the first time. In January this year, 3.168 million barrels of oil per day and 138.753 million cubic meters of natural gas were extracted.[114]\nBrazil is one of the main world producers of hydroelectric power. In 2019, Brazil had 217 hydroelectric plants in operation, with an installed capacity of 98,581 MW, 60.16% of the country's energy generation.[115] In the total generation of electricity, in 2019 Brazil reached 170,000 megawatts of installed capacity, more than 75% from renewable sources (the majority, hydroelectric).[116][117]\nIn 2013, the Southeast Region used about 50% of the load of the National Integrated System (SIN), being the main energy consuming region in the country. The region's installed electricity generation capacity totaled almost 42,500 MW, which represented about a third of Brazil's generation capacity. The hydroelectric generation represented 58% of the region's installed capacity, with the remaining 42% corresponding basically to the thermoelectric generation. S\u00e3o Paulo accounted for 40% of this capacity; Minas Gerais by about 25%; Rio de Janeiro by 13.3%; and Esp\u00edrito Santo accounted for the rest. The South Region owns the Itaipu Dam, which was the largest hydroelectric plant in the world for several years, until the inauguration of Three Gorges Dam in China. It remains the second largest operating hydroelectric in the world. Brazil is the co-owner of the Itaipu Plant with Paraguay: the dam is located on the Paran\u00e1 River, located on the border between countries. It has an installed generation capacity of 14 GW for 20 generating units of 700 MW each. North Region has large hydroelectric plants, such as Belo Monte Dam and Tucuru\u00ed Dam, which produce much of the national energy. Brazil's hydroelectric potential has not yet been fully exploited, so the country still has the capacity to build several renewable energy plants in its territory.[118][119]\nAs of July\u00a02022,[ref] according to ONS, total installed capacity of wind power was 22 GW, with average capacity factor of 58%.[120][121] While the world average wind production capacity factors is 24.7%, there are areas in Northern Brazil, specially in Bahia State, where some wind farms record with average capacity factors over 60%;[122][30] the average capacity factor in the Northeast Region is 45% in the coast and 49% in the interior.[123] In 2019, wind energy represented 9% of the energy generated in the country.[124] In 2019, it was estimated that the country had an estimated wind power generation potential of around 522 GW (this, only onshore), enough energy to meet three times the country's current demand.[125][126] In 2021 Brazil was the 7th country in the world in terms of installed wind power (21 GW),[127][128] and the 4th largest producer of wind energy in the world (72 TWh), behind only China, USA and Germany.[129]\nNuclear energy accounts for about 4% of Brazil's electricity.[130] The nuclear power generation monopoly is owned by Eletronuclear (Eletrobr\u00e1s Eletronuclear S/A), a wholly owned subsidiary of Eletrobr\u00e1s. Nuclear energy is produced by two reactors at Angra. It is located at the Central Nuclear Almirante \u00c1lvaro Alberto (CNAAA) on the Praia de Itaorna in Angra dos Reis, Rio de Janeiro. It consists of two pressurized water reactors, Angra I, with capacity of 657 MW, connected to the power grid in 1982, and Angra II, with capacity of 1,350 MW, connected in 2000. A third reactor, Angra III, with a projected output of 1,350 MW, is planned to be finished.[131]\nAs of October\u00a02022,[ref] according to ONS, total installed capacity of photovoltaic solar was 21 GW, with average capacity factor of 23%.[132] Some of the most irradiated Brazilian States are MG (\"Minas Gerais\"), BA (\"Bahia\") and GO (Goi\u00e1s), which have indeed world irradiation level records.[133][30][134] In 2019, solar power represented 1,27% of the energy generated in the country.[124] In 2021, Brazil was the 14th country in the world in terms of installed solar power (13 GW),[135] and the 11th largest producer of solar energy in the world (16.8 TWh).[136]\nIn 2020, Brazil was also the 2nd largest country in the world in the production of energy through biomass (energy production from solid biofuels and renewable waste), with 15,2 GW installed.[137]\nTransport in Brazil is basically carried out using the road mode, the most developed in the region. There is also a considerable infrastructure of ports and airports. The railway and fluvial sector, although it has potential, is usually treated in a secondary way.\nBrazil has more than 1.7\u00a0million km of roads, of which 215,000\u00a0km are paved, and about 14,000\u00a0km are divided highways. The two most important highways in the country are BR-101 and BR-116.[138] Due to the Andes Mountains, Amazon River and Amazon Forest, there have always been difficulties in implementing transcontinental or bioceanic highways. Practically the only route that existed was the one that connected Brazil to Buenos Aires, in Argentina and later to Santiago, in Chile. However, in recent years, with the combined effort of South American countries, new routes have started to emerge, such as Brazil-Peru (Interoceanic Highway), and a new highway between Brazil, Paraguay, northern Argentina and northern Chile (Bioceanic Corridor).\nThere are more than 2,000 airports in Brazil. The country has the second largest number of airports in the world, behind only the United States. S\u00e3o Paulo International Airport, located in the Metropolitan Region of S\u00e3o Paulo, is the largest and busiest in the country \u2013 the airport connects S\u00e3o Paulo to practically all major cities around the world. Brazil has 44 international airports, such as those in Rio de Janeiro, Bras\u00edlia, Belo Horizonte, Porto Alegre, Florian\u00f3polis, Cuiab\u00e1, Salvador, Recife, Fortaleza, Bel\u00e9m and Manaus, among others. The 10 busiest airports in South America in 2017 were: S\u00e3o Paulo-Guarulhos (Brazil), Bogot\u00e1 (Colombia), S\u00e3o Paulo-Congonhas (Brazil), Santiago (Chile), Lima (Peru), Bras\u00edlia (Brazil), Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), Buenos Aires-Aeroparque (Argentina), Buenos Aires-Ezeiza (Argentina), and Minas Gerais (Brazil).[139]\nAbout ports, Brazil has some of the busiest ports in South America, such as Port of Santos, Port of Rio de Janeiro, Port of Paranagu\u00e1, Port of Itaja\u00ed, Port of Rio Grande, Port of S\u00e3o Francisco do Sul and Suape Port. The 15 busiest ports in South America are: Port of Santos (Brazil), Port of Bahia de Cartagena (Colombia), Callao (Peru), Guayaquil (Ecuador), Buenos Aires (Argentina), San Antonio (Chile), Buenaventura (Colombia), Itaja\u00ed (Brazil), Valpara\u00edso (Chile), Montevideo (Uruguay), Paranagu\u00e1 (Brazil), Rio Grande (Brazil), S\u00e3o Francisco do Sul (Brazil), Manaus (Brazil) and Coronel (Chile).[140]\nThe Brazilian railway network has an extension of about 30,000 kilometers. It's basically used for transporting ores.[141]\nAmong the main Brazilian waterways, two stand out: Hidrovia Tiet\u00ea-Paran\u00e1 (which has a length of 2,400\u00a0km, 1,600 on the Paran\u00e1 River and 800\u00a0km on the Tiet\u00ea River, draining agricultural production from the states of Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Goi\u00e1s and part of Rond\u00f4nia, Tocantins and Minas General) and Hidrovia do Solim\u00f5es-Amazonas (it has two sections: Solim\u00f5es, which extends from Tabatinga to Manaus, with approximately 1600\u00a0km, and Amazonas, which extends from Manaus to Bel\u00e9m, with 1650\u00a0km.\nAlmost entirely passenger transport from the Amazon basin is done by this waterway, in addition to practically all cargo transportation that is directed to the major regional centers of Bel\u00e9m and Manaus). In Brazil, this transport is still underutilized: the most important waterway stretches, from an economic point of view, are found in the Southeast and South of the country. Its full use still depends on the construction of locks, major dredging works and, mainly, of ports that allow intermodal integration.\nBrazil was the 25th largest exporter in the world in 2020, with 1.1% of the global total.[142]\nIn 2021, Brazil exported US$280.4 billion and imported US$219.4 billion, with a surplus of US$61 billion.[143]\nThe country's top ten export products were:[144]\nThe country also exports maize, coffee, cotton, tobacco, orange juice, footwear, airplanes, helicopters, cars, vehicle parts, gold, ethanol, semi-finished iron, among others.[145][146]\nThe main countries to which Brazil exports in 2021 were:[147]\nThe country's export model, until today, is excessively based on exports of basic or semi-manufactured products, generating criticism, since such model generates little monetary value, which prevents further growth in the country in the long run. There are several factors that cause this problem, the main ones being: the excessive collection of taxes on production (due to the country's economic and legislative model being based on State Capitalism and not on Free-Market Capitalism), the lack or deficiency of infrastructure (means of transport such as roads, railways and ports that are insufficient or weak for the country's needs, bad logistics and excessive bureaucracy) for export, high production costs (expensive energy, expensive fuel, expensive maintenance of trucks, expensive loan rates and bank financing for production, expensive export rates), the lack of an industrial policy, the lack of focus on adding value, the lack of aggressiveness in international negotiations, in addition to abusive tariff barriers imposed by other countries on the country's exports. Because of this, Brazil has never been very prominent in international trade.\nDue to its size and potential, it would be able to be among the 10 largest exporters in the world, however, its participation in global commercial transactions usually oscillates between 0.5 and 2% only. In 2019, among the ten products that Brazil exports the most and that generate the most value, eight come from the agribusiness. Although still modest, the country's exports have evolved, and today they are more diversified than they were in the past. At the beginning of the 20th century, 70% of Brazilian exports were restricted to coffee. Overall, however, global trade still concentrates its few exports on low-tech products (mainly agricultural and mineral commodities) and, therefore, with low added value.[148][149][150][151][152]\nThe main countries from which Brazil imports in 2021 were:[147]\nPortuguese explorers arrived in 1500, but it was only in 1808 that Brazil obtained a permit from the Portuguese colonial government to set up its first factories and manufacturers. In the 21st century, Brazil became the eighth largest economy in the world. Originally, its exports were basic raw and primary goods, such as sugar, rubber and gold. Today, 84% of exports are of manufactured and semi-manufactured products.\nThe period of great economic transformation and growth occurred between 1875 and 1975.[155]\nIn the last decade, domestic production increased by 32.3%. Agribusiness (agriculture and cattle-raising), which grew by 47% or 3.6% per year, was the most dynamic sector \u2013 even after having weathered international crises that demanded constant adjustments to the Brazilian economy.[156] The Brazilian government also launched a program for economic development acceleration called Programa de Acelera\u00e7\u00e3o do Crescimento, aiming to spur growth.[157]\nBrazil's transparency rank in the international world is 75th according to Transparency International.[158]\nAmong measures recently adopted to balance the economy, Brazil carried out reforms to its social security (state and retirement pensions) and tax systems. These changes brought with them a noteworthy addition: a Law of Fiscal Responsibility which controls public expenditure by the executive branches at federal, state and municipal levels. At the same time, investments were made towards administration efficiency and policies were created to encourage exports, industry and trade, thus creating \"windows of opportunity\" for local and international investors and producers.\nWith these alterations in place, Brazil has reduced its vulnerability: it does not import the oil it consumes; it has halved its domestic debt through exchange rate-linked certificates and has seen exports grow, on average, by 20% a year. The exchange rate does not put pressure on the industrial sector or inflation (at 4% a year), and does away with the possibility of a liquidity crisis. As a result, the country, after 12 years, has achieved a positive balance in the accounts which measure exports/imports, plus interest payments, services and overseas payment. Thus, respected economists say that the country will not be deeply affected by the current world economic crisis.[159]\nIn 2017, President Michel Temer refused to make public the list of companies accused of \"modern slavery\". The list, made public yearly since the presidency of Lula Da Silva in 2003, was intended to persuade companies to settle their fines and conform to labor regulations, in a country where corruption of the political class risked compromising respect for the law. The relations of the president-in-office with the \"landowner lobby\" were denounced by dismissed President Dilma Rousseff on this occasion.[160]\nSupport for the productive sector has been simplified at all levels; active and independent, Congress and the Judiciary Branch carry out the evaluation of rules and regulations. Among the main measures taken to stimulate the economy are the reduction of up to 30 percent on manufactured products tax (IPI), and the investment of $8\u00a0billion on road cargo transportation fleets, thus improving distribution logistics. Further resources guarantee the propagation of business and information telecenters.\nThe policy for industry, technology and foreign trade, at the forefront of this sector, for its part, invests $19.5\u00a0billion in specific sectors, following the example of the software and semiconductor, pharmaceutical and medicine product, and capital goods sectors.[161]\nBetween 1985 and 2017, 11,563 mergers & acquisitions with a total known value of US$1,185\u00a0billion with the involvement of Brazilian firms were announced.[162] The year 2010 was a new record in terms of value with $115\u00a0billion of transactions. It is worth noticing, that in the top 100 deals by value there are only four cases of Brazilian companies acquiring a foreign company. This reflects the strong interest in the country from a direct investment perspective.\nHere is a list of the largest deals where Brazilian companies took on either the role of the acquiror or the target:\nAccording to a search of Global Entrepreneurship Monitor in 2011 Brazil had 27 million adults aged between 18 and 64 either starting or owning a business, meaning that more than one in four Brazilian adults were entrepreneurs. In comparison to the other 54 countries studied, Brazil was the third-highest in total number of entrepreneurs. The Institute of Applied Economic Research (Ipea), a government agency, found that 37\u00a0million jobs in Brazil were associated with businesses with less than 10 employees.[163]\nEven though Brazil ranks internationally as one of the hardest countries in the region to do business due to its complicated bureaucracy, there is a healthy number of entrepreneurs, thanks to the huge internal consumer market and various government programs.\nThe most recent research of Global Entrepreneurship Monitor revealed in 2013 that 50.4% of Brazilian new entrepreneurs are men, 33.8% are in the 35\u201344 age group, 36.9% completed high school and 47.9% earn 3\u20136 times the Brazilian minimum wage. In contrast, 49.6% of entrepreneurs are female, only 7% are in the 55\u201364 age group, 1% have postgraduate education and 1.7% earn more than 9 times the minimum wage.[164]\nBrazil's credit rating was downgraded by Standard & Poor's (S&P) to BBB in March 2014, just one notch above junk.[165] It was further downgraded in January 2018 by S&P to BB-, which is 2 notches below investment grade.[166]\nWorld portal", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Brazil", " https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/india#bodyContent", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page",

Wikipedia": {"text": "Vedic Sanskrit was an ancient language of the Indo-Aryan subgroup of the Indo-European language family. It is attested in the Vedas and related literature[2] compiled over the period of the mid-2nd to mid-1st millennium BCE.[3] It was orally preserved, predating the advent of writing by several centuries.[4][5]\nExtensive ancient literature in the Vedic Sanskrit language has survived into the modern era, and this has been a major source of information for reconstructing Proto-Indo-European and Proto-Indo-Iranian history.[6][7]\nThe separation of Proto-Indo-Iranian language into Proto-Iranian and Proto-Indo-Aryan is estimated, on linguistic grounds, to have occurred around or before 1800 BCE.[6][8] \nThe date of composition of the oldest hymns of the Rigveda is vague at best, generally estimated to roughly 1500 BCE.[9] Both Asko Parpola (1988) and J. P. Mallory (1998) place the locus of the division of Indo-Aryan from Iranian in the Bronze Age culture of the Bactria\u2013Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC). Parpola (1999) elaborates the model and has \"Proto-Rigvedic\" Indo-Aryans intrude the BMAC around 1700 BCE. He assumes early Indo-Aryan presence in the Late Harappan horizon from about 1900 BCE, and \"Proto-Rigvedic\" (Proto-Dardic) intrusion to Punjab as corresponding to the Gandhara grave culture from about 1700 BCE. According to this model, Rigvedic within the larger Indo-Aryan group is the direct ancestor of the Dardic languages.[10]\nThe early Vedic Sanskrit language was far less homogeneous compared to the language defined by P\u0101\u1e47ini, i.e., Classic Sanskrit. The language in the early Upanishads of Hinduism and the late Vedic literature approaches Classical Sanskrit.[11] The formalization of the late form of Vedic Sanskrit language into the Classical Sanskrit form is credited to P\u0101\u1e47ini's A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b, along with Patanjali's Mahabhasya and Katyayana's commentary that preceded Patanjali's work.[12][13]\nFive chronologically distinct strata can be identified within the Vedic language:[14][15][16]\nThe first three are commonly grouped together, as the Sa\u1e43hit\u0101s[A] comprising the four Vedas:[B] \u1e5bk, atharvan, yajus, s\u0101man, which together constitute the oldest texts in Sanskrit and the canonical foundation both of the Vedic religion, and the later religion known as Hinduism.[19]\nMany words in the Vedic Sanskrit of the \u1e5ag\u00b7veda have cognates or direct correspondences with the ancient Avestan language, but these do not appear in post-Rigvedic Indian texts. The text of the  \u1e5ag\u00b7veda must have been essentially complete by around the 12th century BCE. The pre-1200 BCE layers mark a gradual change in Vedic Sanskrit, but there is disappearance of these archaic correspondences and linguistics in the post-Rigvedic period.[14][15]\nThis period includes both the mantra and prose language of the Atharvaveda (Paippalada and Shaunakiya), the \u1e5ag\u00b7veda Khilani, the Samaveda Sa\u1e43hit\u0101, and the mantras of the Yajurveda. These texts are largely derived from the \u1e5ag\u00b7veda, but have undergone certain changes, both by linguistic change and by reinterpretation. For example, the more ancient injunctive verb system is no longer in use.[14][15]\nAn important linguistic change is the disappearance of the injunctive, subjunctive, optative, imperative (the aorist). New innovations in Vedic Sanskrit appear such as the development of periphrastic aorist forms. This must have occurred before the time of P\u0101\u1e47ini because Panini makes a list of those from the northwestern region of India who knew these older rules of Vedic Sanskrit.[14][15]\nIn this layer of Vedic literature, the archaic Vedic Sanskrit verb system has been abandoned, and a prototype of pre-Panini Vedic Sanskrit structure emerges. The Yaj\u00f1ag\u0101th\u0101s texts provide a probable link between Vedic Sanskrit, Classical Sanskrit and languages of the Epics. Complex meters such as Anu\u1e63\u1e6dubh and rules of Sanskrit prosody had been or were being innovated by this time, but parts of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a layers show the language is still close to Vedic Sanskrit.[20][15]\nThis is the last stratum of Vedic literature, comprising the bulk of the \u015arautas\u016btras and G\u1e5bhyas\u016btras and some Upani\u1e63ads such as the Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad and Maitr\u0101ya\u1e47iya Upani\u1e63ad.[15] These texts elucidate the state of the language which formed the basis of P\u0101\u1e47ini's codification into Classical Sanskrit.[21]\nVedic differs from Classical Sanskrit to an extent comparable to the difference between Homeric Greek and Classical Greek.\nThe following differences may be observed in the phonology:\nVedic had a pitch accent[29] which could even change the meaning of the words, and was still in use in P\u0101\u1e47ini's time, as inferred by his use of devices to indicate its position. At some latter time, this was replaced by a stress accent limited to the second to fourth syllables from the end.[a]\nSince a small number of words in the late pronunciation of Vedic carry the so-called \"independent svarita\" on a short vowel, one can argue that late Vedic was marginally a tonal language. Note however that in the metrically-restored versions of the Rig Veda almost all of the syllables carrying an independent svarita must revert to a sequence of two syllables, the first of which carries an ud\u0101tta and the second a so-called dependent svarita. Early Vedic was thus definitely not a tonal language like Chinese but a pitch accent language like Japanese, which was inherited from the Proto-Indo-European accent.\nPitch accent was not restricted to Vedic: early Sanskrit grammarian P\u0101\u1e47ini gives both accent rules for the spoken language of his (post-Vedic) time as well as the differences of Vedic accent. However, no extant post-Vedic text with accents are found.\nPluti, or prolation, is the term for the phenomenon of protracted or overlong vowels in Sanskrit; the overlong or prolated vowels are themselves called pluta.[30] Pluta vowels are usually noted with a numeral \"3\" (\u0969) indicating a length of three morae (trim\u0101tra).[31][32]\nA diphthong is prolated by prolongation of its first vowel.[31] P\u0101\u1e47inian grammarians recognise the phonetic occurrence of diphthongs measuring more than three morae in duration, but classify them all as prolated (i.e. trimoraic) to preserve a strict tripartite division of vocalic length between hrasva (short, 1 mora), d\u012brgha (long, 2 morae) and pluta (prolated, 3+ morae).[31][33]\nPluta vowels are recorded a total of 3 times in the Rigveda and 15 times in the Atharvaveda, typically in cases of questioning and particularly where two options are being compared.[30][31] For example:[31]\nThe pluti attained the peak of their popularity in the Brahmana period of late Vedic Sanskrit (roughly 8th century BC), with some 40 instances in the Shatapatha Brahmana alone.[34]", "links":
