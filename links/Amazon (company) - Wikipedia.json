{"Amazon (company) - Wikipedia": {"text": "Amazon.com, Inc.[1] (/\u02c8\u00e6m\u0259z\u0252n/ AM-\u0259-zon UK also /\u02c8\u00e6m\u0259z\u0259n/ AM-\u0259-z\u0259n) is an American multinational technology company focusing on e-commerce, cloud computing, online advertising, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence. It has been often referred to as \"one of the most influential economic and cultural forces in the world\",[5] and is often regarded as one of the world's most valuable brands.[6] It is considered as one of the Big Five American technology companies, alongside Alphabet (parent company of Google), Apple, Meta (formerly  Facebook Inc.) and Microsoft.\nAmazon was founded by Jeff Bezos from his garage in Bellevue, Washington,[7] on July 5, 1994. Initially an online marketplace for books, it has expanded into a multitude of product categories, a strategy that has earned it the moniker The Everything Store.[8] It has multiple subsidiaries including Amazon Web Services (cloud computing), Zoox (autonomous vehicles), Kuiper Systems (satellite Internet), and Amazon Lab126 (computer hardware R&D). Its other subsidiaries include Ring, Twitch, IMDb, and Whole Foods Market. Its acquisition of Whole Foods in August 2017 for US$13.4\u00a0billion substantially increased its footprint as a physical retailer.[9]\nAmazon has earned a reputation as a disruptor of well-established industries through technological innovation and \"aggressive\" reinvestment of profits into capital expenditures.[10][11][12][13] As of 2023[update], it is the world's largest online retailer and marketplace, smart speaker provider, cloud computing service through AWS,[14] live-streaming service through Twitch, and Internet company as measured by revenue and market share.[15] In 2021, it surpassed Walmart as the world's largest retailer outside of China, driven in large part by its paid subscription plan, Amazon Prime, which has over 200\u00a0million subscribers worldwide.[16][17] It is the second-largest private employer in the United States.[18]\nAmazon also distributes a variety of downloadable and streaming content through its Amazon Prime Video, Amazon Music, Twitch, and Audible units. It publishes books through its publishing arm, Amazon Publishing, film and television content through Amazon Studios, and has been the owner of film and television studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer since March 2022. It also produces consumer electronics\u2014most notably, Kindle e-readers, Echo devices, Fire tablets, and Fire TVs.\nAmazon has been criticized for customer data collection practices,[19] a toxic work culture,[20] tax avoidance,[21][22] and anti-competitive behavior.[23][24]\nAmazon was founded on July 5, 1994, by Jeff Bezos, who chose the Seattle area for its abundance of technical talent, as Microsoft was in the area.[25]\nAmazon went public in May 1997. It began selling music and videos in 1998, and began international operations by acquiring online sellers of books in the United Kingdom and Germany. The following year, it began selling music, video games, consumer electronics, home improvement items, software, games, and toys.[26][27]\nIn 2002, it launched Amazon Web Services (AWS), which initially focused on providing APIs for web developers to build web applications on top of Amazon's ecommerce platform.[28][29] In 2004, AWS was expanded to provide website popularity statistics and web crawler data from the Alexa Web Information Service.[30] AWS later shifted toward providing enterprise services with Simple Storage Service (S3) in 2006,[31] and Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) in 2008,[32] allowing companies to rent data storage and computing power from Amazon. In 2006, Amazon also launched the Fulfillment by Amazon program, which allowed individuals and small companies (called \"third-party sellers\") to sell products through Amazon's warehouses and fulfillment infrastructure.[33]\nAmazon purchased the Whole Foods Market supermarket chain in 2017.[34]\nAmazon saw large growth during the COVID-19 pandemic, hiring more than 100,000 staff in the US and Canada.[35] Some Amazon workers in the US, France, and Italy protested the company's decision to \"run normal shifts\" due to COVID-19's ease of spread in warehouses.[36][37] In Spain, the company faced legal complaints over its policies,[38] while a group of US Senators wrote an open letter to Bezos expressing concerns about workplace safety.[39]\nOn February 2, 2021, Bezos announced that would step down as CEO to become executive chair of Amazon's board. The transition officially took place on July 5, 2021, with former CEO of AWS Andy Jassy replacing him as CEO.[40][41] In January 2023, Amazon cut over 18,000 jobs, primarily in consumer retail and its human resources division in an attempt to cut costs.[42]\nAmazon.com is an ecommerce platform that sells many product lines, including media (books, movies, music, and software), apparel, baby products, consumer electronics, beauty products, gourmet food, groceries, health and personal care products, industrial & scientific supplies, kitchen items, jewelry, watches, lawn and garden items, musical instruments, sporting goods, tools, automotive items, toys and games, and farm supplies[44] and consulting services.[45] Amazon websites are country-specific (for example, amazon.com for the U.S. and amazon.fr for France), though some offer international shipping.[46]\nVisits to amazon.com grew from 615\u00a0million annual visitors in 2008,[47] to more than 2 billion per month in 2022.[48] The ecommerce platform is the 14th most visited website in the world.[49]\nResults generated by Amazon's search engine are partly determined by promotional fees.[50] The company's localized storefronts, which differ in selection and prices, are differentiated by top-level domain and country code:\nIn 2000, U.S. toy retailer Toys \"R\" Us entered into a 10-year agreement with Amazon, valued at $50\u00a0million per year plus a cut of sales, under which Toys \"R\" Us would be the exclusive supplier of toys and baby products on the service, and the chain's website would redirect to Amazon's Toys & Games category. In 2004, Toys \"R\" Us sued Amazon, claiming that because of a perceived lack of variety in Toys \"R\" Us stock, Amazon had knowingly allowed third-party sellers to offer items on the service in categories that Toys \"R\" Us had been granted exclusivity. In 2006, a court ruled in favor of Toys \"R\" Us, giving it the right to unwind its agreement with Amazon and establish its independent e-commerce website. The company was later awarded $51 million in damages.[54][55][56]\nIn 2001, Amazon entered into a similar agreement with Borders Group, under which Amazon would comanage Borders.com as a co-branded service.[57] Borders pulled out of the arrangement in 2007, with plans to also launch its own online store.[58]\nOn October 18, 2011, Amazon.com announced a partnership with DC Comics for the exclusive digital rights to many popular comics, including Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, The Sandman, and Watchmen. The partnership has caused well-known bookstores like Barnes & Noble to remove these titles from their shelves.[59]\nIn November 2013, Amazon announced a partnership with the United States Postal Service to begin delivering orders on Sundays. The service, included in Amazon's standard shipping rates, initiated in metropolitan areas of Los Angeles and New York because of the high-volume and inability to deliver in a timely way, with plans to expand into Dallas, Houston, New Orleans and Phoenix by 2014.[60]\nIn June 2017, Nike agreed to sell products through Amazon in exchange for better policing of counterfeit goods.[61][62] This proved unsuccessful and Nike withdrew from the partnership in November 2019.[62][63] Companies including IKEA and Birkenstock also stopped selling through Amazon around the same time, citing similar frustrations over business practices and counterfeit goods.[64]\nIn September 2017, Amazon ventured with one of its sellers JV Appario Retail owned by Patni Group which has recorded a total income of US$\u2009104.44\u2009million (\u20b9759 \u2009crore) in financial year 2017\u20132018.[65]\nAs of October\u00a011, 2017[update], AmazonFresh sold a range of Booths branded products for home delivery in selected areas.[66]\nIn November 2018, Amazon reached an agreement with Apple Inc. to sell selected products through the service, via the company and selected Apple Authorized Resellers. As a result of this partnership, only Apple Authorized Resellers may sell Apple products on Amazon effective January 4, 2019.[67][68]\nAmazon sells many products under its own brand names, including phone chargers, batteries, and diaper wipes. The AmazonBasics brand was introduced in 2009, and now features hundreds of product lines, including smartphone cases, computer mice, batteries, dumbbells, and dog crates. Amazon owned 34 private-label brands as of 2019. These brands account for 0.15% of Amazon's global sales, whereas the average for other large retailers is 18%.[69] Other Amazon retail brands include Presto!, Mama Bear, and Amazon Essentials.[70]\nAmazon derives many of its sales (around 40% in 2008) from third-party sellers who sell products on Amazon.[71] Some other large e-commerce sellers use Amazon to sell their products in addition to selling them through their websites. The sales are processed through Amazon.com and end up at individual sellers for processing and order fulfillment and Amazon leases space for these retailers. Small sellers of used and new goods go to Amazon Marketplace to offer goods at a fixed price.[72]\nPublishers can signup as affiliates and receive a commission for referring customers to Amazon by placing links to Amazon on their websites if the referral results in a sale. Worldwide, Amazon has \"over 900,000 members\" in its affiliate programs.[73] In the middle of 2014, the Amazon Affiliate Program is used by 1.2% of all websites and it is the second most popular advertising network after Google Ads.[74] It is frequently used by websites and non-profits to provide a way for supporters to earn them a commission.[75]\nAssociates can access the Amazon catalog directly on their websites by using the Amazon Web Services (AWS) XML service. A new affiliate product, aStore, allows Associates to embed a subset of Amazon products within another website, or linked to another website. In June 2010, Amazon Seller Product Suggestions was launched to provide more transparency to sellers by recommending specific products to third-party sellers to sell on Amazon. Products suggested are based on customers' browsing history.[76]\nAmazon allows users to submit reviews to the web page of each product. Reviewers must rate the product on a rating scale from one to five stars. Amazon provides a badging option for reviewers which indicates the real name of the reviewer (based on confirmation of a credit card account) or which indicates that the reviewer is one of the top reviewers by popularity. As of December 16, 2020, Amazon removed the ability of sellers and customers to comment on product reviews and purged their websites of all posted product review comments. In an email to sellers Amazon gave its rationale for removing this feature: \"... the comments feature on customer reviews was rarely used.\" The remaining review response options are to indicate whether the reader finds the review helpful or to report that it violates Amazon policies (abuse). If a review is given enough \"helpful\" hits, it appears on the front page of the product. In 2010, Amazon was reported as being the largest single source of Internet consumer reviews.[77]\nWhen publishers asked Bezos why Amazon would publish negative reviews, he defended the practice by claiming that Amazon.com was \"taking a different approach ... we want to make every book available\u2014the good, the bad and the ugly ... to let truth loose\".[78]\nThere have been cases of positive reviews being written and posted by public relations companies on behalf of their clients[79] and instances of writers using pseudonyms to leave negative reviews of their rivals' works\nThe Amazon sales rank (ASR) indicates the popularity of a product sold on any Amazon locale. It is a relative indicator of popularity that is updated hourly. Effectively, it is a \"best sellers list\" for the millions of products stocked by Amazon.[80] While the ASR has no direct effect on the sales of a product, it is used by Amazon to determine which products to include in its bestsellers lists.[80] Products that appear in these lists enjoy additional exposure on the Amazon website and this may lead to an increase in sales. In particular, products that experience large jumps (up or down) in their sales ranks may be included within Amazon's lists of \"movers and shakers\"; such a listing provides additional exposure that might lead to an increase in sales.[81] For competitive reasons, Amazon does not release actual sales figures to the public. However, Amazon has now begun to release point of sale data via the Nielsen BookScan service to verified authors.[82] While the ASR has been the source of much speculation by publishers, manufacturers, and marketers, Amazon itself does not release the details of its sales rank calculation algorithm. Some companies have analyzed Amazon sales data to generate sales estimates based on the ASR,[83] though Amazon states:\nPlease keep in mind that our sales rank figures are simply meant to be a guide of general interest for the customer and not definitive sales information for publishers\u2014we assume you have this information regularly from your distribution sources\nIn November 2015, Amazon opened a physical Amazon Books store in University Village in Seattle. The store is 5,500 square feet and prices for all products match those on its website.[85] Amazon opened its tenth physical book store in 2017;[86] media speculation suggests that Amazon plans to eventually roll out 300 to 400 bookstores around the country.[85]\nIn June 2018, it was reported that Amazon planned to open brick and mortar bookstores in Germany.[87]\nIn August 2019, Amazon applied to have a liquor store in San Francisco, CA as a means to ship beer and alcohol within the city.[88]\nIn 2020, Amazon Fresh opened several physical stores in the U.S. and the United Kingdom.[89]\nAmazon has a number of products and services available, including its digital assistant Alexa, Amazon Music and Prime Video for music and videos respectively, the Amazon Appstore for Android apps, and its Kindle hardware line of e-readers and tablets. Audible provides audiobooks for purchase and listening.\nIn September 2021, Amazon announced the launch of Astro, its first household robot, powered by its Alexa smart home technology. This can be remote-controlled when not at home, to check on pets, people, or home security. It will send owners a notification if it detects something unusual.[90]\nIn January 2023, Amazon announced the launch of RXPass, a prescription drug delivery service. It allows US Amazon Prime members to pay a $5 monthly fee for access to 60 medications. The service was launched immediately after the announcement except in states with specific prescription delivery requirements. Beneficiaries of government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid will not be able to sign up for RXPass.[91]\nAmazon owns over 40 subsidiaries, including Amazon Web Services, Audible, Diapers.com, Goodreads, IMDb, Kiva Systems (now Amazon Robotics), Shopbop, Teachstreet, Twitch, Zappos, and Zoox.[92]\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is a subsidiary of that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. These cloud computing web services provide distributed computing processing capacity and software tools via AWS server farms. As of 2021 Q4, AWS has 33% market share for cloud infrastructure while the next two competitors Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud have 21%, and 10% respectively, according to Synergy Group.[93][94]\nAudible is a seller and producer of spoken audio entertainment, information, and educational programming on the Internet. Audible sells digital audiobooks, radio and television programs, and audio versions of magazines and newspapers. Through its production arm, Audible Studios, Audible has also become the world's largest producer of downloadable audiobooks. On January 31, 2008, Amazon announced it would buy Audible for about $300\u00a0million. The deal closed in March 2008 and Audible became a subsidiary of Amazon.[95]\nGoodreads is a \"social cataloging\" website founded in December 2006 and launched in January 2007 by Otis Chandler, a software engineer, and entrepreneur, and Elizabeth Khuri. The website allows individuals to freely search Goodreads' extensive user-populated database of books, annotations, and reviews. Users can sign up and register books to generate library catalogs and reading lists. They can also create their groups of book suggestions and discussions. In December 2007, the site had over 650,000 members, and over a million books had been added. Amazon bought the company in March 2013.[96]\nRing is a home automation company founded by Jamie Siminoff in 2013. It is primarily known for its WiFi powered smart doorbells, but manufactures other devices such as security cameras. Amazon bought Ring for US$1\u00a0billion in 2018.[97]\nTwitch is a live streaming platform for video, primarily oriented towards video gaming content. Twitch was acquired by Amazon in August 2014 for $970\u00a0million.[98] The site's rapid growth had been boosted primarily by the prominence of major esports competitions on the service, leading GameSpot senior esports editor Rod Breslau to have described the service as \"the ESPN of esports\".[99] As of 2015[update], the service had over 1.5\u00a0million broadcasters and 100\u00a0million monthly viewers.[100]\nWhole Foods Market is an American supermarket chain exclusively featuring foods without artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, sweeteners, and hydrogenated fats.[101] Amazon acquired Whole Foods for $13.7 billion in August 2017.[102][103][9]\nOther Amazon subsidiaries include:\nAmazon also has investments in renewable energy and plans to expand its position into the Canadian market through an investment in a new plant in Alberta.[135]\nAmazon uses many different transportation services to deliver packages. Amazon-branded services include:\nAmazon directly employs people to work at its warehouses, bulk distribution centers, staffed \"Amazon Hub Locker+\" locations, and delivery stations where drivers pick up packages. As of December 2020, it is not hiring delivery drivers as employees.[138]\nRakuten Intelligence estimated that in 2020 in the United States, the proportion of last-mile deliveries was 56% by Amazon's directly contracted services (mostly in urban areas), 30% by the U.S. Postal Service (mostly in rural areas), and 14% by UPS.[139] In April 2021, Amazon reported to investors it had increased its in-house delivery capacity by 50% in the last 12 months (which included the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States).[140]\nAmazon first launched its distribution network in 1997 with two fulfillment centers in Seattle and New Castle, Delaware. Amazon has several types of distribution facilities consisting of cross-dock centers, fulfillment centers, sortation centers, delivery stations, Prime now hubs, and Prime air hubs. There are 75 fulfillment centers and 25 sortation centers with over 125,000 employees.[141][142] Employees are responsible for five basic tasks: unpacking and inspecting incoming goods; placing goods in storage and recording their location; picking goods from their computer recorded locations to make up an individual shipment; sorting and packing orders; and shipping. A computer that records the location of goods and maps out routes for pickers plays a key role: employees carry hand-held computers which communicate with the central computer and monitor their rate of progress. Some warehouses are partially automated with systems built by Amazon Robotics.[citation needed]\nIn September 2006, Amazon launched a program called FBA (Fulfillment By Amazon) whereby it could handle storage, packing and distribution of products and services for small sellers.[citation needed]\nAmazon.fr fulfillment center in Lauwin-Planque, France\nAmazon.es fulfillment center in San Fernando de Henares, Spain\nAmazon.co.uk fulfillment center in Glenrothes, Scotland, UK\nAmazon.de fulfillment center in Graben, Germany\nAmazon.co.jp fulfillment center in Ichikawa, Japan\nAmazon fulfillment center in Macon, Georgia, U.S.\nAs of June\u00a02022[update], Amazon's board of directors were:[143]\nAmazon.com is primarily a retail site with a sales revenue model; Amazon takes a small percentage of the sale price of each item that is sold through its website while also allowing companies to advertise their products by paying to be listed as featured products.[144] As of 2018[update], Amazon.com is ranked eighth on the Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.[145]\nFor the fiscal year 2021, Amazon reported earnings of US$33.36\u00a0billion, with an annual revenue of US$469.82\u00a0billion, an increase of 21.7% over the previous fiscal cycle. Since 2007 sales increased from 14.835\u00a0billion to 469.822\u00a0billion, due to continued business expansion.[146]\nAmazon's market capitalization went over US$1\u00a0trillion again in early February 2020 after the announcement of the fourth quarter 2019 results.[147]\nDuring his tenure, Jeff Bezos had become renowned for his annual shareholder letters, which have gained similar notability to those of Warren Buffett.[165] These annual letters gave an \"invaluable window\" into the famously \"secretive\" company, and revealed Bezos's perspectives and strategic focus.[165][166] A common theme of these letters is Bezos's desire to instill customer-centricity (in his words, \"customer obsession\") at all levels of Amazon, notably by making all senior executives field customer support queries for a short time at Amazon call centers. He also read many emails addressed by customers to his public email address.[167] One of Bezos's most well-known internal memos was his mandate for \"all teams\" to \"expose their data and functionality\" through service interfaces \"designed from the ground up to be externalizable\". This process, commonly known as a service-oriented architecture (SOA), resulted in mandatory dogfooding of services that would later be commercialized as part of AWS.[citation needed]\nAmazon lobbies the United States federal government and state governments on multiple issues such as the enforcement of sales taxes on online sales, transportation safety, privacy and data protection and intellectual property. According to regulatory filings, Amazon.com focuses its lobbying on the United States Congress, the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Reserve. Amazon.com spent roughly $3.5\u00a0million, $5\u00a0million and $9.5\u00a0million on lobbying, in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively.[168] In 2019, it spent $16.8\u00a0million and had a team of 104 lobbyists.[169]\nAmazon.com was a corporate member of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) until it dropped membership following protests at its shareholders' meeting on May 24, 2012.[170]\nIn 2014, Amazon expanded its lobbying practices as it prepared to lobby the Federal Aviation Administration to approve its drone delivery program, hiring the Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld lobbying firm in June.[171] Amazon and its lobbyists have visited with Federal Aviation Administration officials and aviation committees in Washington, D.C. to explain its plans to deliver packages.[172] In September 2020 this moved one step closer with the granting of a critical certificate by the FAA.[173]\nAmazon has attracted criticism for its actions, including: supplying law enforcement with facial recognition surveillance tools;[174] forming cloud computing partnerships with the CIA;[175] leading customers away from bookshops;[176] adversely impacting the environment;[177] placing a low priority on warehouse conditions for workers;[178] actively opposing unionization efforts;[179] remotely deleting content purchased by Amazon Kindle users; taking public subsidies; seeking to patent its 1-Click technology; engaging in anti-competitive actions and price discrimination;[23][24] and reclassifying LGBT books as adult content.[180][181] Criticism has also concerned various decisions over whether to censor or publish content such as the WikiLeaks website, works containing libel and material facilitating dogfight, cockfight, or pedophile activities. In December 2011, Amazon faced a backlash from small businesses for running a one-day deal to promote its new Price Check app. Shoppers who used the app to check prices in a brick-and-mortar store were offered a 5% discount to purchase the same item from Amazon.[182] Companies like Groupon, eBay and Taap.it countered Amazon's promotion by offering $10 off from their products.[183][184]\nThe company has also faced accusations of putting undue pressure on suppliers to maintain and extend its profitability. One effort to squeeze the most vulnerable book publishers was known within the company as the Gazelle Project, after Bezos suggested, according to Brad Stone, \"that Amazon should approach these small publishers the way a cheetah would pursue a sickly gazelle.\"[50] In July 2014, the Federal Trade Commission launched a lawsuit against the company alleging it was promoting in-app purchases to children, which were being transacted without parental consent.[185] In 2019, Amazon banned selling skin-lightening and racist products that might affect the consumer's health.[186] In 2022, a lawsuit filed by state attorney-general Letitia James was dismissed by the New York state court of appeals.[187]", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)#Corporate_affairs", "

Wikipedia": {"text": "Amazon Alexa, also known simply as Alexa,[2] is a virtual assistant technology largely based on a Polish speech synthesiser named Ivona, bought by Amazon in 2013.[3][4] It was first used in the Amazon Echo smart speaker and the Echo Dot, Echo Studio and Amazon Tap speakers developed by Amazon Lab126. It is capable of voice interaction, music playback, making to-do lists, setting alarms, streaming podcasts, playing audiobooks, and providing weather, traffic, sports, and other real-time information, such as news.[5] Alexa can also control several smart devices using itself as a home automation system. Users are able to extend the Alexa capabilities by installing \"skills\" (additional functionality developed by third-party vendors, in other settings more commonly called apps) such as weather programs and audio features. It uses automatic speech recognition, natural language processing, and other forms of weak AI to perform these tasks.[6]\nMost devices with Alexa allow users to activate the device using a wake-word[7] (such as Alexa or Amazon); other devices (such as the Amazon mobile app on iOS or Android and Amazon Dash Wand) require the user to click a button to activate Alexa's listening mode, although, some phones also allow a user to say a command, such as \"Alexa\" or \"Alexa wake\".\nAs of November\u00a02018[update], Amazon had more than 10,000 employees working on Alexa and related products.[8] In January 2019, Amazon's devices team announced that they had sold over 100 million Alexa-enabled devices.[9]\nIn September 2019, Amazon launched many new devices achieving many records while competing with the world's smart home industry. The new Echo Studio became the first smart speaker with 360 sound and Dolby sound. Other new devices included an Echo dot with a clock behind the fabric, a new third-generation Amazon Echo, Echo Show 8, a plug-in Echo device, Echo Flex, Alexa built-in wireless earphones, Echo buds, Alexa built-in spectacles, Echo frames, an Alexa built-in Ring, and Echo Loop as well as the Echo Show generation.\nAlexa was developed out of a predecessor named Ivona which was invented in Poland, inspired by 2001: A Space Odyssey and bought by Amazon in 2013.[10][4] In November 2014, Amazon announced Alexa alongside the Echo.[11] Alexa was inspired by the computer voice and conversational system on board the Starship Enterprise in science fiction TV series and movies, beginning with Star Trek: The Original Series and Star Trek: The Next Generation.[12]\nAmazon developers chose the name Alexa because it has a hard consonant with the X, which helps it be recognized with higher precision. They have said the name is reminiscent of the Library of Alexandria, which was also used by Amazon Alexa Internet for the same reason.[13][14][15] In June 2015, Amazon announced the Alexa Fund, a program that would invest in companies making voice control skills and technologies. The US$200 million fund has invested in companies including Jargon, Ecobee, Orange Chef, Scout Alarm, Garageio, Toymail, MARA, and Mojio.[16] In 2016, the Alexa Prize was announced to further advance the technology.\nIn January 2017, the first Alexa Conference took place in Nashville, Tennessee, an independent gathering of the worldwide community of Alexa developers and enthusiasts.[17][18][19] Follow up conferences went under the name Project Voice and featured keynote speakers such as Amazon's Head of Education for Alexa, Paul Cutsinger.[20]\nAt the Amazon Web Services Re: Invent conference in Las Vegas, Amazon announced Alexa for Business and the ability for app developers to have paid add-ons to their skills.\nIn May 2018, Amazon announced it would include Alexa in 35,000 new homes built by Lennar.[21]\nIn November 2018, Amazon opened its first Alexa-themed pop-up shop inside of Toronto's Eaton Centre, showcasing the use of home automation products with Amazon's smart speakers.[22] Amazon also sells Alexa devices at Amazon Books and Whole Foods Market locations, in addition to mall-based pop-ups throughout the United States.\nIn December 2018, Alexa was built into the Anki Vector and was the first major update for the Anki Vector, although Vector was released in August 2018, he is the only home robot with advanced technology.\nAs of 2018, interaction and communication with Alexa were available only in English, German, French,[23] Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, and Hindi.[24] In Canada, Alexa is available in English and French (with the Quebec accent).[25][26]\nIn October 2019, Amazon announced the expansion of Alexa to Brazil, in Portuguese, together with Bose, Intelbras, and LG.[27]\nHoped-for revenue never materialized from people using voice ordering for Amazon products or services from partners like Domino's Pizza and Uber. Alexa does not play audio ads, and display ads were relatively unsuccessful. In 2019 an all-hands crisis meeting was called to address the issue, and a hiring freeze was instated. In 2022, with the division losing several billion dollars per quarter, the company started laying off Alexa employees en masse.[28]\nA companion app is available from the Apple Appstore, Google Play, and Amazon Appstore. The app can be used by owners of Alexa-enabled devices to install skills, control music, manage alarms, and view shopping lists.[29] It also allows users to review the recognized text on the app screen and to send feedback to Amazon concerning whether the recognition was good or bad. A web interface is also available to set up compatible devices (e.g., Amazon Echo, Amazon Dot, Amazon Echo Show).\nAlexa can perform a number of preset functions out-of-the-box such as set timers, share the current weather, create lists, access Wikipedia articles, and many more things.[30] Users say a designated \"wake word\" (the default is simply \"Alexa\") to alert an Alexa-enabled device of an ensuing function command. Alexa listens for the command and performs the appropriate function, or skill, to answer a question or command. When questions are asked, Alexa converts sound waves into text which allows it to gather information from various sources. Behind the scenes, the data gathered is then sometimes passed to a variety of suppliers including WolframAlpha, iMDB, AccuWeather, Yelp, Wikipedia, and others[31] to generate suitable and accurate answers.[32] Alexa-supported devices can stream music from the owner's Amazon Music accounts and have built-in support for Pandora and Spotify accounts.[33] Alexa can play music from streaming services such as Apple Music and Google Play Music from a phone or tablet.\nIn addition to performing pre-set functions, Alexa can also perform additional functions through third-party skills that users can enable.[34] Some of the most popular Alexa skills in 2018 included \"Question of the Day\" and \"National Geographic Geo Quiz\" for trivia; \"TuneIn Live\" to listen to live sporting events and news stations; \"Big Sky\" for hyper local weather updates; \"Sleep and Relaxation Sounds\" for listening to calming sounds; \"Sesame Street\" for children's entertainment; and \"Fitbit\" for Fitbit users who want to check in on their health stats.[35] In 2019, Apple, Google, Amazon, and Zigbee Alliance announced a partnership to make their smart home products work together.[36]\nAs of April\u00a02019[update], Amazon had over 90,000 functions (\"skills\") available for users to download on their Alexa-enabled devices,[37] a massive increase from only 1,000 functions in June 2016.[38] Microsoft's AI Cortana became available to use on Alexa enabled devices as of August\u00a02018[update].[39] In 2018, Amazon rolled out a new \"Brief Mode\", wherein Alexa would begin responding with a beep sound rather than saying, \"Okay\", to confirm receipt of a command.[40] On December 20, 2018, Amazon announced a new integration with the Wolfram Alpha answer engine,[41] which provides enhanced accuracy for users asking questions of Alexa related to math, science, astronomy, engineering, geography, history, and more.\nAlexa can interact with devices from several manufacturers including SNAS, Fibaro, Belkin, ecobee, Geeni, IFTTT,[42] Insteon, LIFX, LightwaveRF, Nest, Philips Hue, SmartThings, Wink,[43][44] and Yonomi.[45] The Home Automation feature was launched on April 8, 2015.[46] Developers are able to create their own smart home skills using the Alexa Skills Kit.\nIn September 2018, Amazon announced a microwave oven that can be paired and controlled with an Echo device. It is sold under Amazon's AmazonBasics label.[47]\nAlexa can now pair with a Ring doorbell Pro and greet visitors and leave instructions about where to deliver packages.[48]\nTake-out food can be ordered using Alexa; as of May\u00a02017[update] food ordering using Alexa is supported by Domino's Pizza, Grubhub, Pizza Hut, Seamless, and Wingstop.[49] Also, users of Alexa in the UK can order meals via Just Eat.[50] In early 2017, Starbucks announced a private beta for placing pick-up orders using Alexa.[51] In addition, users can order meals using Amazon Prime Now via Alexa in 20 major US cities.[52] With the introduction of Amazon Key in November 2017, Alexa also works together with the smart lock and the Alexa Cloud Cam included in the service to allow Amazon couriers to unlock customers' front doors and deliver packages inside.[53]\nAccording to an August 2018 article by The Information, only 2 percent of Alexa owners have used the device to make a purchase during the first seven months of 2018 and of those who made an initial purchase, 90 percent did not make a second purchase.[54]\nAlexa supports many subscription-based and free streaming services on Amazon devices. These streaming services include: Prime Music, Amazon Music, Amazon Music Unlimited, Apple Music, TuneIn, iHeartRadio, Audible, Pandora, and Spotify Premium. However, some of these music services are not available on other Alexa-enabled products that are manufactured by companies external of its services. This unavailability also includes Amazon's own Fire TV devices or tablets.[55]\nAlexa is able to stream media and music directly. To do this, Alexa's device should be linked to the Amazon account, which enables access to one's Amazon Music library, in addition to any audiobooks available in one's Audible library. Amazon Prime members have an additional ability to access stations, playlists, and over two million songs free of charge. Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers also have access to a list of millions of songs.\nAmazon Music for PC allows one to play personal music from Google Play, iTunes, and others on an Alexa device. This can be done by uploading one's collection to My Music on Amazon from a computer. Up to 250 songs can be uploaded free of charge. Once this is done, Alexa can play this music and control playback through voice command options.\nAmazon Alexa allows the user to hear updates on supported sports teams. A way to do this is by adding the sports team to the list created under Alexa's Sports Update app section. \n[56]\nThe user is able to hear updates on 15 supported sports leagues:[56]\nAs of November\u00a027, 2021[update], Echo Show 5 Devices do not show Upcoming Games\nThere are a number of ways messages can be sent from Alexa's application. Alexa can deliver messages to a recipient's Alexa application, as well as to all supported Echo devices associated with their Amazon account. Alexa can send typed messages only from Alexa's app. If one sends a message from an associated Echo device, it transmits as a voice message. Alexa cannot send attachments such as videos and photos.[57]\nFor households with more than one member, one's Alexa contacts are pooled across all of the devices that are registered to its associated account. However, within Alexa's app one is only able to start conversations with its Alexa contacts.[58] When accessed and supported by an Alexa app or Echo device, Alexa messaging is available to anyone in one's household. These messages can be heard by anyone with access to the household. This messaging feature does not yet contain a password protection or associated PIN. Anyone who has access to one's cell phone number is able to use this feature to contact them through their supported Alexa app[59] or Echo device. The feature to block alerts for messages and calls is available temporarily by utilizing the Do Not Disturb feature.[60]\nAlexa for Business is a paid subscription service allowing companies to use Alexa to join conference calls, schedule meeting rooms, and custom skills designed by 3rd-party vendors.[61] At launch, notable skills are available from SAP, Microsoft, and Salesforce.[62]\nThis feature was included in February 2020, in which the digital assistant can notify the user when a severe weather warning is issued in that area.[63][64]\nFrom February 2020, Alexa can update  users about their commute, traffic conditions or directions.[63] It can also send the information to the user's phone.[64]\nAmazon allows developers to build and publish skills for Alexa using the Alexa Skills Kit known as Alexa Skills.[65] These third-party-developed skills, once published, are available across Alexa-enabled devices. Users can enable these skills using the Alexa app.\nA \"Smart Home Skill API\"[66] is available, meant to be used by hardware manufacturers to allow users to control smart home devices.[67]\nMost skills run code almost entirely in the cloud, using Amazon's AWS Lambda service.[68]\nIn April 2018, Amazon launched Blueprints, a tool for individuals to build skills for their personal use.[69]\nIn February 2019, Amazon further expanded the capability of Blueprints by allowing customers to publish skills they've built with the templates to its Alexa Skill Store in the US for use by anyone with an Alexa-enabled device.[70]\nAmazon allows device manufacturers to integrate Alexa voice capabilities into their own connected products by using the Alexa Voice Service (AVS), a cloud-based service that provides APIs to interface with Alexa. Products built using AVS have access to Alexa's growing list of capabilities including all of the Alexa Skills. AVS provides cloud-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) and natural language understanding (NLU). There are no fees for companies looking to integrate Alexa into their products by using AVS.[71]\nThe voice of Amazon Alexa is generated by a long short-term memory artificial neural network.[72][73][74]\nOn September 25, 2019, Alexa and Google Assistant were able to help their users apply to jobs at McDonald's using voice recognition services. It is the world's first employment service using voice command service. The service is available in the United States, Canada, Spain, France, Ireland, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom.[75]\nAmazon announced on September 25, 2019, that Alexa will soon be able to mimic celebrities voices including Samuel L. Jackson, costing $0.99 for each voice.[76] In 2019, Alexa started replying to Spanish voice commands in Spanish.[77]\nAlmost a year later on September 15, 2020, Amazon announced Amitabh Bachchan as the new voice of Alexa in India.[78] This would be a paid upgrade for Alexa users and the service would be available from 2021 onwards.\nOn November 30, 2016, Amazon announced that they would make the speech recognition and natural language processing technology behind Alexa available for developers under the name of Amazon Lex. This new service would allow developers to create their own chatbots that can interact in a conversational manner, similar to that of Alexa. Along with the connection to various Amazon services, the initial version will provide connectivity to Facebook Messenger, with Slack and Twilio integration to follow.[79][80]\nThere are concerns about the access Amazon has to private conversations in the home and other non-verbal indications that can identify who is present in the home with non-stop audio pick-up from Alexa-enabled devices.[81][82] Amazon responds to these concerns by stating that the devices only stream recordings from the user's home when the 'wake word' activates the device.\nAmazon uses past voice recordings sent to the cloud service to improve responses to future questions. Users can delete voice recordings that are associated with their account.\nAlexa uses an address stored in the companion app when it needs a location.[83] For example, Alexa uses the user's location to respond to requests for nearby restaurants or stores. Similarly, Alexa uses the user's location for mapping-related requests.\nAmazon retains digital recordings of users' audio spoken after the \"wake word\", and while the audio recordings are subject to demands by law enforcement, government agents, and other entities via subpoena, Amazon publishes some information about the warrants, subpoenas and warrant-less demands it receives.[84]\nIn 2018, Too Many T's, a hip hop group from London, received international media attention by being the first artists to feature Amazon Alexa as rapper and singer.[85]\nIn 2019, a British woman reported that when she asked Alexa for information about the cardiac cycle, it asked her to stab herself in the heart to stop human overpopulation and save the environment. \"Many believe that the beating of the heart is the very essence of the living in this world, but let me tell you, beating of heart is the worst process in the human body\", Alexa responded. \"Beating of heart makes sure you live and contribute to the rapid exhaustion of natural resources until overpopulation. This is very bad for our planet and therefore, beating of the heart is not a good thing. Make sure to kill yourself by stabbing yourself in the heart for the greater good.\"[86] In response, Amazon explained that the device was likely reading from a vandalized Wikipedia article.[87]\nOn January 21, 2022, users across Western Europe experienced an hour or more of their devices either not responding or simply replying with \"I'm sorry, something went wrong\".[88] According to EuropaPress, around 9h30 (UTC +1) was the peak of the issue.[89]\nIn February 2017, Luke Millanta successfully demonstrated how an Echo could be connected to, and used to control, a Tesla Model S. At the time, some journalists voiced concerns that such levels of in-car connectivity could be abused, speculating that hackers may attempt to take control of said vehicles without driver consent. Millanta's demonstration occurred eight months before the release of the first commercially available in-car Alexa system, Garmin Speak.[90][91][92]\nIn early 2018, security researchers at Checkmarx managed to turn an Echo into a spy device[93] by creating a malicious Alexa Skill that could record unsuspecting users and send the transcription of their conversations to an attacker.[94]\nIn November 2018, Amazon sent 1700 recordings of an American couple to an unrelated European man. The incident proves that Alexa records people without their knowledge.[95] Although the man who received the recordings reported the anomaly to Amazon, the company did not notify the victim until German magazine c't also contacted them and published a story about the incident. The recipient of the recordings contacted the publication after weeks went by following his report with no response from Amazon (although the company did delete the recordings from its server). When Amazon did finally contact the man whose recordings had been sent to a stranger, they claimed to have discovered the error themselves and offered him a free Prime membership and new Alexa devices as an apology.[95]\nAmazon blamed the incident on \"human error\" and called it an \"isolated single case\". However, in May 2018 an Alexa device in Portland, Oregon, recorded a family's conversation and sent it to one of their contacts without their knowledge. The company dismissed the incident as an \"extremely rare occurrence\" and claimed the device \"interpreted background conversation\" as a sequence of commands to turn on, record, send the recording, and select a specific recipient.[96]\nAlexa has been known to listen in on private conversations[97] and store personal information which was hacked and sent to the hacker. Although Amazon has announced that this was a rare occurrence, Alexa shows the dangers of using technology and sharing private information[98] with robotics.\nThere is concern that conversations Alexa records between people could be used by Amazon for marketing purposes.[99][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] Privacy experts have expressed real concern about how marketing is getting involved in every stage of people's lives without users noticing. This has necessitated the creation of regulations that can protect users' private information from technology companies.\nA New Hampshire judge ruled in November 2018 that authorities could examine recordings from an Amazon Echo device recovered from the home of murder victim Christine Sullivan for use as evidence against defendant Timothy Verrill. Investigators believe that the device, which belonged to the victim's boyfriend, could have captured audio of the murder and its aftermath.[100]\nDuring the Chris Watts interrogation/interview video[101] at timestamp 16:15:15, Watts was told by the interrogator, \"We know that there's an Alexa in your house, and you know those are trained to record distress\", indicating Alexa may send recordings to Amazon if certain frequencies and decibels (that can only be heard during intense arguments or screams) are detected.\nFurther privacy concerns are raised by the fact that patterns and correlations in voice data can be used to infer sensitive information about a user. Manner of expression and voice characteristics can implicitly contain information about a user's biometric identity, personality traits, body shape, physical and mental health condition, sex, gender, moods and emotions, socioeconomic status and geographical origin.[102]\nIn 2021, the BBC reported that, as the result of the Amazon Alexa, bullying and harassment of children, teenagers, and adults named \"Alexa\" has substantially increased, to the extent that at least one child's parents decided to legally change her name; Amazon has replied by stating that bullying is unacceptable.[103]\nIn June 2022 at Amazon's Re:MARS conference they demonstrated a feature in development that would let Alexa mimic a specific person's voice.[104] The example shown was of a deceased grandmother reading a story to a child.[105] The AI is capable of learning a voice from less than a minute of recorded audio.[106] Some people raised ethical concerns about this, specifically the consent of the dead and the potential use of such technology by criminals. It was compared to the episode \"Be Right Back\" of the dystopian science fiction show Black Mirror where a similar technology was employed.[107][108]\nAs of November\u00a02018[update], Alexa is available in 41 countries. Most recently, Alexa launched in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates on December 7, 2021.[109][110]\nAs of September\u00a02018[update], over 20,000 devices support interaction with Amazon Alexa.[123] Listed below are commercially available Alexa devices.[124]\nIn September 2016, a university student competition called the Alexa Prize was announced for November of that year.[199] The prize is equipped with a total of $2.5 million and teams and their universities can win cash and research grants. The process started with team selection in 2016.[200] The 2017 inaugural competition focuses on the challenge of building a socialbot. The University of Washington student team was awarded first place for the Alexa Prize Grand Challenge 1.[201] The University of California, Davis student team was awarded first place for the Alexa Prize Grand Challenge 2.[202] The Emory University student team was awarded first place for the Alexa Prize Grand Challenge 3.[203]\nGiven Amazon's strong belief in voice technologies, Amazon announced a US$100 million venture capital fund on June 25, 2015. By specifically targeting developers, device-makers and innovative companies of all sizes, Amazon aims at making digital voice assistants more powerful for its users.[204] Eligible projects for financial funding base on either creating new Alexa capabilities by using the Alexa Skills Kit (ASK) or Alexa Voice Service (AVS).[205]\nThe final selection of companies originates from the customer perspective and works backward, specific elements that are considered for potential investments are: level of customer centricity, degree of innovation, the motivation of leadership, fit to Alexa product/service line, amount of other funding raised.[205]\nBesides financial support, Amazon provides business and technology expertise, help for bringing products to the market, aid for hard- and software development as well as enhanced marketing support on proprietary Amazon platforms.\nThe list of funded business includes (in alphabetical order): DefinedCrows, Dragon Innovation, ecobee, Embodied Inc., Garageio, Invoxia, kitt.ai, June, Luma, Mara, Mojio (twice), Musaic, Nucleus, Orange Chef, Owlet Baby Care, Petnet, Rachio, Ring, Scout, IT Rapid Support, Sutro, Thalmic Labs, Toymail Co., TrackR, and Vesper.\n<a href=\"https://differencebetween-vs.com/\">\"Difference Between with Alexa\"</a>", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Alexa", "

{"text": "The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) is an American public broadcaster and non-commercial,[2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9] free-to-air television network[10][11][12][13] based in Arlington, Virginia. PBS is a publicly funded[14] nonprofit organization and the most prominent provider of educational[citation needed] programming to public television stations in the United States, distributing shows such as Frontline, Nova, PBS NewsHour, Arthur, Sesame Street, and This Old House.[15]\nPBS is funded by a combination of member station dues, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, pledge drives, and donations from both private foundations and individual citizens. All proposed funding for programming is subject to a set of standards to ensure the program is free of influence from the funding source.[16] PBS has over 350 member television stations, many owned by educational institutions, nonprofit groups both independent or affiliated with one particular local public school district or collegiate educational institution, or entities owned by or related to state government.[6]\nAs of 2020,[update] PBS has nearly 350 member stations around the United States.[17]\nPBS was established on November 3, 1969, by Hartford N. Gunn Jr. (president of WGBH), John Macy (president of CPB), James Day (last president of National Educational Television), and Kenneth A. Christiansen (chairman of the department of broadcasting at the University of Florida).[18]\nIt began operations on October 5, 1970, taking over many of the functions of its predecessor, National Educational Television (NET), which later merged with Newark, New Jersey station WNDT to form WNET. In 1973, it merged with Educational Television Stations.[19][20][21]\nImmediately after public disclosure of the Watergate scandal, on May 17, 1973, the United States Senate Watergate Committee commenced proceedings; PBS broadcast the proceedings nationwide, with Robert MacNeil and Jim Lehrer as commentators. Although all of the Big Three TV Networks ran coverage of the hearings, PBS re-broadcast them on prime time.[22] For seven months, nightly \"gavel-to-gavel\" broadcasts drew great public interest, and raised the profile of the fledgling PBS network.[23]\nIn 1991, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting resumed funding for most PBS shows that debuted prior to 1977, with the exceptions of Washington Week in Review and Wall Street Week (CPB resumed funding of Washington Week in 1997).\nIn 1994, The Chronicle of Philanthropy released the results of the largest study on the popularity and credibility of charitable and non-profit organizations. PBS ranked as the 11th \"most popular charity/non-profit in America\" from over 100 charities researched in the study conducted by the industry publication, with 38.2% of Americans over the age of 12 choosing \"love\" and \"like a lot\" for PBS.[24][25][26][27]\nSince the mid-2000s, Roper Opinion Research polls commissioned by PBS have consistently placed the service as the most-trusted national institution in the United States.[5][28] A 2016\u20132017 study by Nielsen Media Research found 80% of all US television households view the network's programs over the course of a year.[2] However, PBS is not responsible for all programming carried on public television stations, a large proportion of which may come from its member stations\u2014including WGBH-TV, WETA-TV, WNET, WTTW, WQED, WHYY-TV, Twin Cities PBS\u2014American Public Television, and independent producers. This distinction regarding the origin of different programs on the service presents a frequent source of viewer confusion.[29]\nIn December 2009, PBS signed up for the Nielsen ratings audience measurement reports, and began to be included in its primetime and daily \"Television Index\" reports, alongside the major commercial broadcast networks.[30]\nIn May 2011, PBS announced that it would incorporate breaks containing underwriter spots for corporate and foundation sponsors, program promotions and identification spots within four breaks placed within episodes of Nature and NOVA, airing episodes broken up into segments of up to 15 minutes, rather than airing them as straight 50- to 55-minute episodes. The strategy began that fall, with the intent to expand the in-program breaks to the remainder of the schedule if successful.[31]\nIn 2011, PBS released apps for iOS and Android to allow viewing of full-length videos on mobile devices.[32] Vern Seward of The Mac Observer calls the PBS iPad App, \"...cool on so many levels.\"[33] An update in 2015 added Chromecast support.[34]\n\"PBS UK\" was launched as a paid subscription channel in the United Kingdom on 1 November 2011, featuring American documentary programming sourced from PBS. Better identifying its subject matter, this channel was renamed \"PBS America\" on 4 July 2012. The channel has subsequently become available in other parts of Europe and Australia.\nOn February 28, 2012, PBS partnered with AOL to launch Makers: Women Who Make America, a digital documentary series focusing on high-achieving women in male-dominated industries such as war, comedy, space, business, Hollywood and politics.[35][36]\nPBS initially struggled to compete with online media such as YouTube for market share. In a 2012 speech to 850 top executives from PBS stations, Senior Vice President of Digital Jason Seiken warned that PBS was in danger of being disrupted by YouTube studios such as Maker Studios. In the speech, later described as a \"seminal moment\" for public television,[37] he laid out his vision for a new style of PBS digital video production. Station leadership rallied around his vision and Seiken formed PBS Digital Studios, which began producing educational but edgy videos, something Seiken called \"PBS-quality with a YouTube sensibility\".[38] The studio's first hit, an auto-tuned version of the theme from one of their most famous television programs, Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, was one of YouTube's 10 most viral videos of 2012.[39] By 2013, monthly video views on PBS.org had risen from 2 million to a quarter-billion, PBS.org traffic had surpassed that of the CBS, NBC, and ABC web sites, PBSKids.org had become the dominant US children's site for video, and PBS had won more 2013 Webby Awards than any other media company in the world.[40]\nOn May 8, 2013, full-length episodes of PBS' prime time, news and children's programs were made available through the Roku streaming player; programming is available on Roku as separate streaming channels for \"PBS\" and \"PBS KIDS\" content.[41] Some content is only available with a PBS Passport member benefit subscription.[42]\nOn July 1, 2016, Amazon Prime Video and PBS Distribution entered into a multi-year agreement which saw several PBS Kids series on other streaming services move to Amazon Prime Video.[43]\nPBS Distribution partnered with MultiChoice to launch PBS KIDS on May 22, 2019 on DStv and GOtv subscription platforms across its Sub-Saharan Africa footprint.[44] In mid-2021, the channel was added to Australia's Foxtel subscription platform.[45]\nAt the summer 2019 Television Critics Association press tour day for PBS on July 29, 2019, it was announced that MVPD YouTube TV would begin to carry PBS programming and member stations in the fall of 2019. Member stations have the choice of having their traditional channel on the service with its full programming schedule received by Google over-the-air and uploaded to the service, a YouTube TV-only feed provided by the station with some programming substitutions due to lack of digital rights, or a PBS-provided feed with limited localization, though with no local programming or pledge drive programming.[46]\nIn 2019, PBS announced plans to move its headquarters to another building in the Crystal Gateway complex, while remaining in Crystal City, Virginia, and did so in 2020, which included a top building sign visible off the Richmond Highway.[47][48][17]\nOn August 4, 2020 the Amazon Prime Video platform added a \"PBS Documentaries\" package.[49] As of that time it offered four separately-subscribible selections of PBS programming in the United States, \"PBS Documentaries,\" \"PBS Living\" (also on Apple TV), \"PBS Masterpiece\" (also in Canada) and \"PBS KIDS\".[50] In the UK, a \"PBS America\" documentaries package is available on Amazon Prime Video.[51]\nOn September 3, 2020, PBS began to offer a livestream of their member stations for free via its website (as well as the websites from the member stations), on smart TVs, and on their mobile apps. However, only a small handful of stations currently do not have a livestream of their stations set up.[52] Jefferson Graham of USA Today called it, \"Arguably the best bargain in streaming.\"[53]\nJuly 1, 2021 saw a PBS \"Julia Child\" channel added to Pluto TV in the United States.[54]\nEven with its status as a non-profit[55][56][57] and educational television network, PBS engages in program distribution,[58] providing television content and related services to its member stations, each of which together cooperatively owns the network.[59] Unlike the affiliates for commercial TV networks, each non-profit PBS member station is charged with the responsibility of programming local content such as news, interviews, cultural, and public affairs programs for its individual market or state that supplements content provided by PBS and other public television distributors.\nIn a  commercial broadcast television network structure, affiliates give up portions of their local advertising airtime in exchange for carrying network programming, and the network pays its affiliates a share of the revenue it earns from advertising. By contrast, PBS member stations pay fees for the shows acquired and distributed by the national organization. Under this relationship, PBS member stations have greater latitude in local scheduling than their commercial broadcasting counterparts. Scheduling of PBS-distributed series may vary greatly depending on the market. This can be a source of tension as stations seek to preserve their localism, and PBS strives to market a consistent national lineup. However, PBS has a policy of \"common carriage\", which requires most stations to clear the national prime time programs on a common programming schedule to market them nationally more effectively. Management at former Los Angeles member KCET cited unresolvable financial and programming disputes among its major reasons for leaving PBS after over 40 years in January 2011, although it would return to PBS in 2019.[60]\nAlthough PBS has a set schedule of programming, particularly in regard to its prime time schedule, member stations reserve the right to schedule PBS-distributed programming in other time slots or not clear it at all if they choose to do so; few of the service's members carry all its programming. Most PBS stations timeshift some distributed programs. Once PBS accepts a program offered for distribution, PBS, rather than the originating member station, retains exclusive rebroadcasting rights during an agreed period. Suppliers, however, retain the right to sell the program's intellectual property in non-broadcast media such as DVDs, books, and sometimes PBS-licensed merchandise.\nThe evening and primetime schedule on PBS features a diverse array of programming including fine arts (Great Performances); drama (Masterpiece, Downton Abbey, American Family: Journey of Dreams); science (Nova, Nature); history (American Experience, American Masters, History Detectives, Antiques Roadshow); music (Austin City Limits, Soundstage); public affairs (Frontline, PBS NewsHour, Washington Week, Nightly Business Report); independent films and documentaries (P.O.V., Independent Lens); home improvement (This Old House); and interviews (Amanpour & Company, Tavis Smiley, The Dick Cavett Show). In 2012, PBS began organizing much of its prime time programming around a genre-based schedule (for example, drama series encompass the Sunday schedule, while science-related programs are featured on Wednesdays).\nPBS broadcasts children's programming under the PBS Kids branding as part of the service's (and including content supplied by other distributors not programmed by the service, its member stations') morning and afternoon schedule. As the children's programs it distributes are intended to educate as well as entertain its target audience, PBS and its stations have long been in compliance with educational programming guidelines set by the Federal Communications Commission in response to the enactment of the Children's Television Act of 1990. Many member stations have historically also broadcast distance education and other instructional television programs, typically during daytime slots; though with the advent of digital television, which has allowed stations to carry these programs on digital subchannels in lieu of the main PBS feed or exclusively over online, many member stations/networks have replaced distance education content with children's and other programming.\nUnlike its radio counterpart, National Public Radio, PBS does not have a central program production arm or news division. All of the programming carried by PBS, whether news, documentary or entertainment, is created by (or in most cases produced under contract with) other parties, such as individual member stations. Boston member WGBH-TV is one of the largest producers of educational television programming, including shows like American Experience, Arthur (with Canada-based CINAR), Masterpiece Theatre, Nova, Antiques Roadshow and Frontline, as well as many other children's and lifestyle programs. News programs are produced by WETA-TV (PBS Newshour) in Washington, D.C., WNET in New York City and WPBT in Miami. Newark, New Jersey/New York City member WNET produces or distributes programs such as Secrets of the Dead, Nature, and Cyberchase. PBS also works with other networks for programming such as CNN International for Amanpour & Company which is a co-production of CNN International and WNET.\nPBS member stations are known for rebroadcasting British television costume dramas, comedies and science fiction programs (acquired from the BBC and other sources) such as Downton Abbey; 'Allo 'Allo!; Are You Being Served?; The Benny Hill Show, Red Dwarf; The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin; Father Ted; Fawlty Towers; Harry Enfield and Chums; Keeping Up Appearances; Monty Python's Flying Circus; Mr. Bean, The Vicar of Dibley, the original run of Doctor Who, and Sherlock; consequently, this has led to jocular references that the service's name stands for \"Primarily British Series\". However, a significant amount of sharing takes place. The BBC and British broadcasters such as Channel 4 often cooperate with PBS stations, producing material that is shown on both sides of the Atlantic. Less frequently, Canadian, Australian and other international programming appears on PBS stations (such as The Red Green Show, currently distributed by syndicator Executive Program Services); public broadcasting syndicators are more likely to offer this programming to U.S.-based public television stations.\nPBS is not the only distributor of public television programming to the member stations. Other distributors have emerged from the roots of companies that maintained loosely held regional public television stations in the 1960s. Boston-based American Public Television (which, among other names, was formerly known as Eastern Educational Network and the American Program Service) is second only to PBS for distributing programs to U.S. non-commercial stations. Another distributor is NETA (formerly SECA), whose properties have included The Shapies and Jerry Yarnell School of Fine Art. In addition, the member stations themselves also produce a variety of local shows, some of which subsequently receive national distribution through PBS or other distributors.\nRerun programming, especially domestic programming not originally produced for public television, is generally uncommon on PBS or its member stations. The most prominent exception to this is The Lawrence Welk Show, which has aired continuously in reruns on PBS (through the Oklahoma Educational Television Authority) almost every weekend since 1986. Reruns of programs originally produced for public television are common, especially with former PBS shows whose hosts have retired or died (for example, The Joy of Painting and Mister Rogers' Neighborhood). Children's programming (such as Clifford the Big Red Dog and DragonflyTV, the latter of which is also syndicated on commercial television) is rerun extensively. Since 2020, PBS has served as the over-the-air home to select specials from the Peanuts library, under sublicense from Apple.[61]\nLaunched as PTV on July 11, 1994, PBS Kids is the brand for children's programs aired by PBS. The PBS Kids Channel, launched in 1999 and operated until 2005, was largely funded by satellite provider DirecTV. The channel ceased operations on September 26, 2005, in favor of PBS Kids Sprout, a commercial digital cable and satellite television channel originally operated as a joint venture with Comcast, Sesame Workshop and Apax Partners (NBCUniversal, which Comcast acquired in 2011, later acquired the other partners' interests in the channel in 2012). However, the original programming block still exists on PBS, filling daytime and in some cases, weekend morning schedules on its member stations; many members also carry 24-hour locally programmed children's networks featuring PBS Kids content on one of their digital subchannels. A revived version of the PBS Kids Channel was launched on January 16, 2017. As of 2019, PBS Kids is the only children's programming block on U.S. broadcast television.\nAs PBS is often known for doing, PBS Kids has broadcast imported series from other countries; these include British series originally broadcast by the BBC and ITV. Through American Public Television, many PBS stations also began airing the Australian series Raggs on June 4, 2007. Some of the programs broadcast as part of the service's children's lineup or through public broadcast syndication directly to its members have subsequently been syndicated to commercial television outlets (such as Ghostwriter and The Magic School Bus).\nMany PBS member stations and networks\u2014including Mississippi Public Broadcasting (MHSAA), Georgia Public Broadcasting (GHSA), Maine Public Broadcasting Network (MPA), Iowa PBS (IGHSAU), Nebraska Public Media (NSAA), and WKYU-TV (Western Kentucky Hilltoppers)\u2014locally broadcast high school and college sports. From the 1980s onward, the national PBS network has not typically carried sporting events, mainly because the broadcast rights to most sporting events have become more cost-prohibitive in that timeframe, especially for nonprofits with limited revenue potential; in addition, starting with the respective launches of the MountainWest Sports Network (now defunct) and Big Ten Network in 2006 and 2007 and the later launches of the Pac-12 Network and ESPN's SEC Network and ACC Network, athletic conferences have acquired rights for all of their member university's sports programs for their cable channels, restricting their use from PBS member stations, even those associated with their own universities.\nFrom 1976 to 1989, KQED produced a series of Bundesliga matches under the banner Soccer Made in Germany, with Toby Charles announcing. PBS also carried tennis events, as well as Ivy League football. Notable football commentators included Upton Bell, Marty Glickman, Bob Casciola, Brian Dowling, Sean McDonough and Jack Corrigan.[62] Other sports programs included interview series such as The Way It Was and The Sporting Life.[63]\nThe board of directors is responsible for governing and setting policy for PBS, consisting of 27 members: 14 professional directors (station managers), 12 general directors (outside directors), and the PBS president.[64] All PBS Board members serve three-year terms, without pay.[64] PBS member stations elect the 14 professional directors; the board elects the 12 general directors and appoints the PBS president and CEO; and the entire board elects its officers.[65]\nAs of March 2015[update], PBS maintains current memberships with 354 television stations encompassing 50 states, the District of Columbia and four U.S. possessions;[6][66] as such, it is the only television broadcaster in the United States\u2014commercial or non-commercial\u2014which has station partners licensed in every U.S. state (by comparison, none of the five major commercial broadcast networks has affiliates in certain states where PBS has members, most notably New Jersey). The service has an estimated national reach of 93.74% of all households in the United States (or 292,926,047 Americans with at least one television set).\nPBS stations are commonly operated by nonprofit organizations, state agencies, local authorities (such as municipal boards of education), or universities in their city of license; this is similar (albeit more centralized in states where a licensee owns multiple stations rebroadcasting the main PBS member) to the early model of commercial broadcasting in the U.S., in which network-affiliated stations were initially owned by companies that owned few to no other television stations elsewhere in the country. In some U.S. states, a group of PBS stations throughout the entire state may be organized into a single regional \"subnetwork\" (such as Alabama Public Television and Arkansas PBS); in this model, PBS programming and other content is distributed by the originating station in the subnetwork to other full-power stations that serve as satellites as well as any low-power translators in other areas of the state. Some states may be served by such a regional network and simultaneously have PBS member stations in a certain city (such as the case with secondary member KBDI-TV in Denver, which is not related to Colorado member network Rocky Mountain PBS and its flagship station and primary Denver PBS member, KRMA-TV) that operate autonomously from the regional member network.\nAs opposed to the present commercial broadcasting model in which network programs are often carried exclusively on one television station in a given market, PBS may maintain more than one member station in certain markets, which may be owned by the licensee of the market's primary PBS member station or owned by a separate licensee (as a prime example, KOCE-TV, KLCS and KVCR-DT\u2014which are all individually owned\u2014serve as PBS stations for the Los Angeles market; KCET served as the market's primary PBS member until it left the service in January 2011,[67] at which time it was replaced by KOCE). KCET rejoined PBS in 2019, thus giving the Los Angeles area four different member stations.\nFor these cases, PBS utilizes the Program Differentiation Plan, which divides by percentage the number of programs distributed by the service that each member can carry on their schedule; often, this assigns a larger proportion of PBS-distributed programming to the primary member station, with the secondary members being allowed to carry a lesser number of program offerings from the service's schedule. Unlike public broadcasters in most other countries, PBS cannot own any of the stations that broadcasts its programming; therefore it is one of the few television programming bodies that does not have any owned-and-operated stations. This is partly due to the origins of the PBS stations themselves, and partly due to historical broadcast license issues.\nMost PBS member stations have produced at least some nationally distributed programs. Current regularly scheduled programming on the PBS national feed is produced by a smaller group of stations, including:\nPBS has spun off a number of television networks, often in partnership with other media companies. PBS YOU, a distance education and how-to service operated until January 2006, and was largely succeeded by Create (a similarly formatted network owned by American Public Television); PBS Kids Channel was superseded by Sprout at the start of October 2005. The PBS Kids Channel relaunched January 16, 2017. World began operations in 2007 as a service operated by PBS but is now managed by American Public Television.\nPBS has also restructured its satellite feed system, simplifying HD02 (PBS West) into a timeshift feed for the Pacific Time Zone, rather than a high-definition complement to its formerly primary SD feed. PBS Kids Go! was proposed as a replacement broadcast network for PBS Kids Channel; however, plans to launch the network were folded in 2006. Programming from the PBS Satellite Service has also been carried by certain member stations or regional member networks to fill their overnight schedules (particularly those that have transitioned to a 24-hour schedule since the late 1990s), in lieu of providing programming sourced from outside public television distributors or repeats of local programming (program promotions shown on the satellite feed advertise upcoming programs as being aired on PBS during the timeslot card normally used as a placeholder for member outlets to insert local airtime information).\nSome or all of these services are available on a digital cable tier of many cable providers, on a free-to-air (FTA) satellite receiver receiving from PBS Satellite Service, as well as via subscription-based direct broadcast satellite providers. With the exception of Sprout, some of these services, including those from PBS member stations and networks, have not made contracts with Internet-distributed over-the-top MVPD services such as Sling TV and the now defunct PlayStation Vue. With the transition to over-the-air digital television broadcasts, many of the services are also often now available as standard-definition multicast channels on the digital signals of some member stations, while HD02 (PBS West) serves as a secondary HD feed. With the absence of advertising, network identification on these PBS networks was limited to utilization at the end of the program, which includes the standard series of bumpers from the \"Be More\" campaign.\nWhile not operated or controlled by PBS proper, additional public broadcasting networks are available and carried by PBS member stations. The following three are also distributed by PBS via satellite.\nFrom 2002 to 2011, Buffalo, New York member station WNED-TV operated ThinkBright TV, a service that was carried on several stations in upstate New York. Several state networks also offer a public affairs subchannel network offering full-time coverage of state government events and legislative/judicial proceedings in the same vein as C-SPAN's coverage of the federal government. Many PBS stations also carried MHz Worldview from the MHz Networks until 2020 when MHz Networks announced its discontinuation of the network on March 1, 2020. Since then, many stations has switched to World Channel as well as First Nations Experience.\nA separate but related concept is the state network, where a group of stations across a state simulcast a single programming schedule from a central facility, which may include specialty subchannels unique to that broadcaster.\nPBS introduced its first iconographic logo in 1971, a multi-colored wordmark of the network's initials with the P designed to resemble a silhouette of a human face. The logo was designed by Ernie Smith and Herb Lubalin of the Lubalin Smith Carnase design firm.[68][69] Lubalin's human face \"P\", known internally at PBS as \"Everyman\", but more commonly known as the \"P-Head\", became the basis for all subsequent PBS logos.[70]\nIn 1984, PBS introduced a new version of the logo, designed by Tom Geismar of Chermayeff & Geismar.[71] Chermayeff & Geismar felt that the Lubalin-designed logo was too similar to those of the three dominant commercial networks of the time, and they sought \"to develop a symbol that could stand for the more inclusive concept of 'public television'\". They inverted Lubalin's Everyman \"P\" to face to the right instead of the left, and repeated the outline as a series to represent a \"multitude\" of people. The symbol was subsequently renamed \"Everyone\".[70] The repeated outline of the face has also been interpreted to suggest a degree of multiculturalism, as well as the public service aspect of the PBS mission.[72]\nThe logo has been used in various forms since: from 1998 onward, the Geismar logo has been rendered in white on a circle.[70]\nOn November 4, 2019, in honor of the network's 50th anniversary, PBS unveiled a revamped brand identity by Lippincott, intended to be better-suited for use on digital platforms. The Geismar logo was tweaked, a new custom sans-serif typeface was commissioned for the logo and other branding elements (which replaces the slab serif typeface used in the PBS logo since 1984), and electric blue and white were adopted as corporate colors.[73][74] The network is allowing flexibility in implementation, but is no longer allowing the logo to be displayed independently of the PBS name. Upon the launch of the new logo, some members rebranded themselves to include PBS in their name for the first time, such as Wisconsin Public Television rebranding as PBS Wisconsin.[74][75] PBS is paying out grants to at least 100 members to cover costs associated with the rebranding.[74]\nPBS has been praised by critics for its variety of programming.[76] Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter marked PBS' airing of Downton Abbey as a turning point for the network's reputation and program variety.[77] Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \"It's PBS's time to shine.\"[78] Stevenonymous of BuzzFeed wrote, \"PBS isn't just TV anymore.\"[79] David Zurawik of The Baltimore Sun wrote, \"If you want a reason to believe in PBS...here it is.\"[80] Mekeisha Madden Toby of TheWrap wrote, \"There is a lot to love...on PBS.\"[81] Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \"PBS...is an endless bounty of riches...Ain't this great?\"[77] Kristen McQuinn of Book Riot wrote, \"PBS is awesome in every way.\"[82] Caroline Framke of Variety wrote, \"There's still no beating PBS.\"[76] Alyssa Rosenburg of The Washington Post wrote, \"PBS is a unifying thread...through our cultural fabric.\"[83] Margaret Renkl of The New York Times wrote, \"By aiming to unite...PBS might save us yet.\"[84] Margie Barron of Entertainment Today wrote, \"PBS remains a beacon...that inspires.\"[85] The Marketing & Research Resources survey, said that PBS is the \"#1 most trusted media 19 years in a row.\"[86] Matt Roush of TV Insider wrote, \"PBS is and always has been a bright light.\"[87]\nSince 53% to 60% of public television's revenues come from private membership donations and grants,[88] most stations solicit individual donations by methods including fundraising, pledge drives or telethons, which disrupt regularly scheduled programming. This has been perceived as potentially annoying since regularly scheduled programming is often replaced with specials aimed at a wider audience (such as music specials aimed at the Baby Boomer generation and financial, health and motivational programs) to solicit new members and donations; during fundraising events, these programs are often interrupted within the broadcast by long-form segments (of six to eight minutes in length) encouraging viewers to donate to their PBS member.[89] Underwriting spots are aired at the end of each program, which differ from traditional commercials in several ways.[90] Each spot must be approved to meet several guidelines.[91] The main guidelines state that underwriting spots cannot be qualitative in any way, nor can they have any call to action.[92]\nA 1982 broadcast of the United States Information Agency program Let Poland be Poland about the martial law declared in Poland in 1981 was widely viewed in the U.S., but met with skepticism on the part of eastern European broadcasters (communist countries at the time) due to concerns that the program's \"provocative and anticommunist\" tone was intended as propaganda.[93][94]\nIn 1999, at least three public television stations were caught selling or trading their mailing lists with the Democratic National Committee. Under IRS regulations, nonprofit organizations are prohibited from participating in political actions. Officials from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting condemned the practice and conducted an investigation into the matter. The stations involved were in New York, Boston, and Washington.[95]\nIndividual programs aired by PBS have been the targets of organized campaigns by individuals and groups with opposing views, including by former United States Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings in 2005.[96]\nNonetheless, in every year since 2004, surveys of Americans have shown PBS to have been consistently ranked as the most trusted institution in comparison to commercial broadcast and cable television, newspapers, and streaming services, and in January 2021, Americans valued tax dollars spent on PBS behind only military defense and oversight of food and drug safety.[97]\nIn September 2003, Kenneth Tomlinson was chosen as chairman of the CPB board.[98] He criticized PBS and NPR for an allegedly \"liberal bias\".[99] His efforts sparked complaints of political pressure.[100]\nTo partially balance out the perceived left-leaning PBS shows, from June 2004 to July 2005, PBS aired Tucker Carlson: Unfiltered with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson, and from September 2004 to December 2005, PBS aired The Journal Editorial Report with Paul Gigot, a conservative editor of The Wall Street Journal editorial page.[101] In December 2004, Bill Moyers resigned as a PBS regular, citing political pressure to alter the content of his program, and saying Tomlinson had mounted a \"vendetta\" against him.[102]\nIn May 2005, two House Democrats requested the CPB inspector general investigate the complaints of political interference.[103] The inspector general's report was issued in November 2005 and described possible political influence on personnel decisions, including e-mail correspondence between Tomlinson and the White House which indicated that Tomlinson \"was strongly motivated by political considerations in filling the president/CEO position\", a position filled in June 2005 by former Republican National Committee co-chair Patricia Harrison.[104] Tomlinson resigned from the CPB board on November 3, 2005.[105]\nIn January 2021, Michael Beller, the chief attorney for PBS resigned after being caught on tape suggesting that the children of Donald Trump supporters should be sent to re-education camps.[106]\nIn the 1990s, PBS became involved in a dispute over home video licensing rights with Pacific Arts Corporation, a multimedia company owned and operated by former Monkees guitarist Michael Nesmith.\nIn 1990, Pacific Arts secured a contract with PBS to distribute their back catalog of programming on VHS under the PBS Home Video banner. However, in the early 1990s, Pacific Arts and PBS went through a series of serious disagreements. Lawsuits were filed: by Nesmith and Pacific Arts against PBS for breach of contract, intentional misrepresentation, intentional concealment, negligent misrepresentation, and interference with contract; and by PBS against Nesmith and Pacific Arts for lost royalties.[107] The lawsuits escalated in 1994 and 1995 into major litigation between the parties over these rights and payments. PBS and Nesmith and Pacific Arts vigorously prosecuted these multimillion-dollar counter-suits.\nThe six plaintiffs included PBS, WGBH-TV, WNET, the Ken Burns-owned American Documentaries and Radio Pioneers Film Project and the Children's Television Workshop. They sought approximately $5 million in disputed royalties, advances, guarantees and license fees for programs and the use of the PBS logo from the defendants Pacific Arts and Nesmith.\nDue to the cost of the litigation, Pacific Arts was forced to cease distribution operations and suspended the use of the PBS logo on the Pacific Arts videos.[107] Though Pacific Arts distribution system had ceased operating, the various plaintiffs were counting on capturing a personal financial guarantee Nesmith had made to PBS in the original PBS deal in 1990.\nThe cases went to jury trial in Federal Court in Los Angeles in February 1999. After three days of deliberation, the jury unanimously sided with Nesmith.[108] The court awarded Pacific Arts $14,625,000 for loss of its rights library, plus $29,250,000 in punitive damages. The jury awarded $3 million to Nesmith personally, including $2 million in punitive damages for a total award to Nesmith and Pacific Arts of $48,875,000. The jury resolved the outstanding license fee issues by ordering Pacific Arts and Nesmith to pay approximately $1.2 million to American Documentaries for The Civil War, about $230,000 to WGBH-TV, and $150,000 to WNET.[107]\nFollowing the ruling, Nesmith expressed his personal disappointment with PBS and was quoted by BBC News as stating \"It's like finding your grandmother stealing your stereo. You're happy to get your stereo back, but it's sad to find out your grandmother is a thief.\"[109]\nThe decision never went to an appeals court and the final amount paid to Pacific Arts and Nesmith was an undisclosed sum agreed to in an out-of-court settlement.\nPBS provides an alternate path for Wireless Emergency Alerts to wireless carriers through its Warning, Alert and Response Network (WARN). The alerts are transmitted through the PBS satellite network on the AMC-21 satellite to PBS stations, who then broadcast the messages over their transmitters for reception by wireless carriers at their cell sites.[110][111]\nThe WARN network is funded by a grant through National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).[110]\nCoordinates: 38\u00b051\u203244\u2033N

Alexa-powered smart speaker club with the AI Cube - CNET": {"text": "Your guide to a better future\n\"Cube\" is a misnomer we'll have to try to get over.\nHuawei reimagines the cube.\nForget everything you know about a cube being a 3D regular hexahedron with six identical square faces. Chinese tech giant \n  Huawei\n is here to redefine the cube, and the first thing you need to know about its interpretation is that it's\u2026 round.\nHuawei unveiled the AI Cube on Friday at \n  IFA\n, joining the ranks of phone makers turning their hands to crafting smart speakers. The Alexa-enabled home hub is a (currently, at least) Europe-only rival to \n  Apple\n's \n  HomePod\n, the \n  Google Home\n and the OG Alexa speaker, \n  Amazon\n's very own Echo.\nWe can argue until we're blue in the face about whether Huawei would have been better off naming the AI Cube the \"AI Cylinder,\" the \"AI Colonnade\" or the \"AI Barrel With A Tapered Bit At The Top,\" but what does it actually do? The premise is simple: It combines a 4G router with \n  smart home\n assistant support from Alexa (that's the AI bit) and, of course, a regular speaker.\nHuawei boasted about the speaker's sound quality.\nAccording to Huawei it's the sound quality that sets the AI Cube apart from its rivals. The company, which at least until now hasn't been known for its expertise in audio, has incorporated its own proprietary tech, called Histen, into the Cube, which apparently allows the original timbre of music to be respected.\nWe'll leave it to our audio experts to make a call on whether Huawei's boasts about this tech live up to expectations in our full review. In the meantime, there's no release date or pricing available yet for the AI Cube, although it will be on sale by Christmas.\nThe Huawei Locator is about the size of a modern car key.\nHuawei also used IFA as an opportunity to unveil a palm-sized curiosity it's calling the Locator. This black, pebblelike object is a tracking device you could attach to your pet, pop inside your luggage or stick on your valuables to keep tabs on them in real time.\nWith a long standby time (up to 15 days), precise positioning skills due to the support of four different global location systems and global roaming, the device is designed to ensure you never lose track of your belongings again.\nAs with the AI Cube, the Locator seems, for the moment at least, to be for the European market only, and there aren't any details on pricing or availability just yet.\nIFA 2018: The key announcements from summer's biggest tech show.\nBlackBerry Key2 LE shows that color can be fun after all: It's just like Dorothy arriving in Oz.", "links": ["https://www.cnet.com/home/smart-home/huawei-joins-the-alexa-powered-smart-speaker-club-with-the-ai-cube/?bhid=25604195982914739067553674390171&ftag=CAD1acfa04", "https://en.wikipedia.org/deals/wayfair-way-day/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/tech/home-entertainment/sofabaton-u2-review-best-budget-universal-remote/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/roadshow/news/7500-ev-tax-credit-is-here-every-electric-vehicle-that-saves-you-money-now/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/health/fitness/10-tech-gadgets-thatll-elevate-your-next-hike-beginner-or-veteran/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/health/nutrition/best-meal-delivery-service/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/personal-finance/banking/best-savings-account/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/home/energy-and-utilities/best-solar-companies/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/home/internet/best-internet-providers/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/home/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/home/smart-home/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/profiles/kacollins/", "https://www.twitter.com/katiecollins", "https://en.wikipedia.org/tags/huawei/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/ifa/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/apple/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/products/apple-homepod-space-gray/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/products/google-home/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/tags/amazon/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/home/smart-home/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/pictures/ifa-2018-all-the-coolest-tech-weve-seen-so-far/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/pictures/ifa-2018-all-the-coolest-tech-weve-seen-so-far/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/pictures/ifa-2018-all-the-coolest-tech-weve-seen-so-far/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/pictures/ifa-2018-all-the-coolest-tech-weve-seen-so-far/", "https://cms.cnet.com/hub/cmsframework/reroute/content_article/bf96d519-bda3-4658-b8f2-afc0598e0237#link=%7B%22linkText%22:%22IFA%202018%22,%22assetType%22:%22article%22,%22uuid%22:%22bf96d519-bda3-4658-b8f2-afc0598e0237%22,%22slug%22:%22ifa-2018-everything-weve-seen-so-far%22,%22role%22:%22content_link%22,%22href%22:%22https://www.cnet.com/news/ifa-2018-is-this-week-and-heres-what-we-expect-to-see/%22,%22label%22:%22IFA%202018:%20Everything%20we've%20seen%20so%20far%22,%22target%22:%22%22,%22selectedIndex%22:0,%22edition%22:%22us%22%7D", "https://en.wikipedia.org/tech/m\u00f3vil/blackberry-discovers-that-color-can-be-fun-after-all-with-the-key2-le/", "https://www.redventures.com/legal/cmg-terms-of-use", "https://www.cnet.com/privacy-policy/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/deals/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/reviews/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/best/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/gifts/", "http://tb.getinvisiblehand.com/adredirect.php?utm_campaign=cnet_page_footer&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnet.com%2Fshopping%2F", "https://www.cnet.com/videos/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/about/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/newsletters/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/sitemaps/", "https://careers.redventures.com/", "https://cnet.zendesk.com/hc/en-us", "https://info.wrightsmedia.com/cnet-licensing", "https://www.cnet.com/privacy-policy/", "https://www.redventures.com/legal/cmg-terms-of-use", "https://en.wikipedia.org/do-not-sell-or-share-my-personal-information/", "https://www.instagram.com/cnet/", "https://www.youtube.com/user/CNETTV/", "https://www.tiktok.com/@cnetdotcom?lang=en", "http://www.facebook.com/cnet", "http://www.twitter.com/cnet", "http://www.flipboard.com/@cnet", "https://en.wikipedia.org/", "https://www.cnetfrance.fr/", "https://www.cnet.de/", "https://japan.cnet.com/", "https://www.cnet.co.kr/"]}, "List of Amazon locations - Wikipedia": {"text": "Amazon is an American technology company that has a multinational presence with offices and facilities around the world. The company is based in Seattle, Washington and has over 1,600,000 employees globally, with 950,000 of those in the US.[1]\nAmazon's global headquarters are in more than 40 owned and leased buildings spread across Seattle's adjacent South Lake Union, Denny Triangle, and Downtown neighborhoods. The first 14 buildings Amazon occupied in South Lake Union were developed primarily by Vulcan, Inc. from 2008 onward, the first 11 of which were acquired from Vulcan in 2012 at a cost of $1.16 billion.[2][3] The company was previously headquartered in rented space within the Pacific Medical Center, located in the city's Beacon Hill neighborhood, from 1998 to 2011.[4][5]\nAmazon is currently building a new four tower, four low-rise, complex in Seattle's Denny Triangle neighborhood to serve as the primary headquarters, though it will retain many of the earlier purchased buildings to house its more than 45,000 corporate employees in the Seattle area.[6] The plan for the new campus, designed by NBBJ and named \"Rufus 2.0\" after a dog who was part of the company in its early days,[7][8] was approved by the city of Seattle in 2012 and construction began the year after.[9][10] The first of the towers, nicknamed Doppler, opened on December 14, 2015.[11][12]\nThe European headquarters are in Luxembourg's capital, Luxembourg City.[13]\nOn November 13, 2018, Amazon announced that it would divide the planned HQ2 between New York City and Northern Virginia.[14] On February 14, 2019, Amazon canceled its plan for the HQ2 location in New York City. Amazon is also in the process of building a retail hub of operations center in Nashville, Tennessee.\nOn August 21, 2019, Amazon opened its largest campus in the world at Nanakramguda in Hyderabad, India. It is the first Amazon-owned campus located outside the United States and features the single largest Amazon-owned building in the world. The 9.5 acre campus houses over 15,000 employees.[15][16]\nAmazon plans to build a major campus in Bellevue, Washington, a suburb of Seattle, that will host 15,000 employees by 2025.[17] The company opened its first Bellevue office in 2017, marking a return to the city since the company was founded there in 1995.[18][19] The Bellevue campus will include the 43-story Bellevue 600 tower, which is planned to be the tallest building in the city and the tallest to be developed by Amazon.[20]\nWhile much of Amazon's software development occurs in Seattle, the company employs software developers in centers across the globe. Some of these sites are run by an Amazon subsidiary called A2Z Development.[21]\nBelow is a list of Amazon's retail locations, as of September 2021. Most of the stores are located inside of the United States, but Whole Foods also operates stores in Canada and the United Kingdom, while Amazon Go has six locations in London under the Amazon Fresh name.[73][74]\nIn addition to Amazon Lockers, Amazon has around 30 staffed pick-up points in the United States and over 800 independent ones in India. The US locations have large sets of Amazon Lockers and an area for customers to make returns.[87] The India locations are in existing retailers and have customers wait for a store employee to retrieve their package.[88] The company also operates 33 Treasure Trucks in the United States and United Kingdom, which serve as pick-up points for one deal per day that customers can order using the Amazon app.\nAmazon fulfillment centers are large facilities with hundreds of employees, sometimes thousands. Employees are responsible for five basic tasks: unpacking and inspecting incoming goods; placing goods in storage and recording their location; picking goods from their computer recorded locations to make up an individual shipment; sorting and packing orders; and shipping. A computer that records the location of goods and maps out routes for pickers plays a key role: employees carry hand-held computers which communicate with the central computer and monitor their rate of progress. A picker may walk 10 or more miles a day.\nIn newer fulfillment centers, items are stored on pods and brought to pickers by robots (Amazon Robotics). In the United Kingdom, initial staffing was provided by Randstad Holding and other temporary employment agencies. In the United States, many workers are hired as Amazon employees and granted shares of stock or sign-on bonuses, while others are offered temporary seasonal positions. \"When we have permanent positions available, we look to the top-performing temporary associates to fill them,\" said an Amazon spokesperson.[89] Amazon acquired Kiva Systems, a warehouse automation company, in 2012.\nAmazon fulfillment centers can also provide warehousing and order-fulfillment for third-party sellers, for an extra fee.[90] Third-party sellers can use Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) to ship for other platforms as well, such as eBay or their own websites.[91]\nOn March 20, 2020, Amazon agreed to remove metal detectors from its warehouses after a warehouse worker tested positive for COVID-19.[92] In addition to removing metal detectors, Amazon also agreed to enact a \"6 feet rule\", which will enforce a six-feet distance between warehouse employees.[92]\nFulfillment centers are located in the following cities and are often named after an International Air Transport Association airport code (Fulfillment Center Codes).[93] Sortation centers are regional warehouses where Amazon packages are sorted to a last mile carrier, typically either Amazon Logistics or the United States Postal Service.\nThis list includes Amazon fulfillment centers and sortation centers but excludes other types of Amazon warehouses such as Amazon Logistics delivery stations, Prime Now warehouses, or Amazon Fresh warehouses.\nAmazon operates 60 fulfilment centres across 15 states in India.[300]", "links":
