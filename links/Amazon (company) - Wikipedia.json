{"Amazon (company) - Wikipedia": {"text": "Amazon.com, Inc.[1] (/\u02c8\u00e6m\u0259z\u0252n/ AM-\u0259-zon UK also /\u02c8\u00e6m\u0259z\u0259n/ AM-\u0259-z\u0259n) is an American multinational technology company focusing on e-commerce, cloud computing, online advertising, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence. It has been referred to as \"one of the most influential economic and cultural forces in the world\",[5] and is one of the world's most valuable brands.[6] It is one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet (Google), Apple, Meta (Facebook), and Microsoft.\nAmazon was founded by Jeff Bezos from his garage in Bellevue, Washington,[7] on July 5, 1994. Initially an online marketplace for books, it has expanded into a multitude of product categories, a strategy that has earned it the moniker The Everything Store.[8] It has multiple subsidiaries including Amazon Web Services (cloud computing), Zoox (autonomous vehicles), Kuiper Systems (satellite Internet), and Amazon Lab126 (computer hardware R&D). Its other subsidiaries include Ring, Twitch, IMDb, and Whole Foods Market. Its acquisition of Whole Foods in August 2017 for US$13.4\u00a0billion substantially increased its footprint as a physical retailer.[9]\nAmazon has earned a reputation as a disruptor of well-established industries through technological innovation and \"aggressive\" reinvestment of profits into capital expenditures.[10][11][12][13] As of 2023[update], it is the world's largest online retailer and marketplace, smart speaker provider, cloud computing service through AWS,[14] live-streaming service through Twitch, and Internet company as measured by revenue and market share.[15] In 2021, it surpassed Walmart as the world's largest retailer outside of China, driven in large part by its paid subscription plan, Amazon Prime, which has over 200\u00a0million subscribers worldwide.[16][17] It is the second-largest private employer in the United States.[18]\nAmazon also distributes a variety of downloadable and streaming content through its Amazon Prime Video, Amazon Music, Twitch, and Audible units. It publishes books through its publishing arm, Amazon Publishing, film and television content through Amazon Studios, and has been the owner of film and television studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer since March 2022. It also produces consumer electronics\u2014most notably, Kindle e-readers, Echo devices, Fire tablets, and Fire TVs.\nAmazon has been criticized for customer data collection practices,[19] a toxic work culture,[20] tax avoidance,[21][22] and anti-competitive behavior.[23][24]\nAmazon was founded on July 5, 1994, by Jeff Bezos, who chose the Seattle area for its abundance of technical talent, as Microsoft was in the area.[25]\nAmazon went public in May 1997. It began selling music and videos in 1998, and began international operations by acquiring online sellers of books in the United Kingdom and Germany. The following year, it began selling music, video games, consumer electronics, home improvement items, software, games, and toys.[26][27]\nIn 2002, it launched Amazon Web Services (AWS), which initially focused on providing APIs for web developers to build web applications on top of Amazon's ecommerce platform.[28][29] In 2004, AWS was expanded to provide website popularity statistics and web crawler data from the Alexa Web Information Service.[30] AWS later shifted toward providing enterprise services with Simple Storage Service (S3) in 2006,[31] and Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) in 2008,[32] allowing companies to rent data storage and computing power from Amazon. In 2006, Amazon also launched the Fulfillment by Amazon program, which allowed individuals and small companies (called \"third-party sellers\") to sell products through Amazon's warehouses and fulfillment infrastructure.[33]\nAmazon purchased the Whole Foods Market supermarket chain in 2017.[34]\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Amazon introduced a hazard pay of $2-per-hour, changes to overtime pay, and a policy of unlimited, unpaid time off until April 30, 2020. The hazard pay increase expired in June 2020, and the paid time-off policy in May 2022.[35][36] Amazon also introduced temporary restrictions on the sale of non-essential goods, and hired 100,000 more staff in the US and Canada.[37] Some Amazon workers in the US, France, and Italy protested the company's decision to \"run normal shifts\" despite many positive COVID-19 cases.[38][39] In Spain, the company has faced legal complaints over its policies.[40] A group of US Senators wrote an open letter to Bezos in March 2020, expressing concerns about worker safety.[41]\nOn February 2, 2021, Amazon announced that Jeff Bezos would step down as CEO to become executive chair of Amazon's board in Q3 of 2021. Andy Jassy, previously CEO of AWS, became Amazon's CEO.[42][43] In January 2023, Amazon announced job cuts for over 18,000 workers, in an attempt to cut costs.[44]\nAmazon.com is an ecommerce platform that sells many product lines, including media (books, movies, music, and software), apparel, baby products, consumer electronics, beauty products, gourmet food, groceries, health and personal care products, industrial & scientific supplies, kitchen items, jewelry, watches, lawn and garden items, musical instruments, sporting goods, tools, automotive items, toys and games, and farm supplies[46] and consulting services.[47] Amazon websites are country-specific (for example, amazon.com for the U.S. and amazon.fr for France), though some offer international shipping.[48]\nVisits to amazon.com grew from 615\u00a0million annual visitors in 2008,[49] to more than 2 billion per month in 2022.[50] The ecommerce platform is the 14th most visited website in the world.[51]\nResults generated by Amazon's search engine are partly determined by promotional fees.[52] The company's localized storefronts, which differ in selection and prices, are differentiated by top-level domain and country code:\nIn 2000, U.S. toy retailer Toys \"R\" Us entered into a 10-year agreement with Amazon, valued at $50\u00a0million per year plus a cut of sales, under which Toys \"R\" Us would be the exclusive supplier of toys and baby products on the service, and the chain's website would redirect to Amazon's Toys & Games category. In 2004, Toys \"R\" Us sued Amazon, claiming that because of a perceived lack of variety in Toys \"R\" Us stock, Amazon had knowingly allowed third-party sellers to offer items on the service in categories that Toys \"R\" Us had been granted exclusivity. In 2006, a court ruled in favor of Toys \"R\" Us, giving it the right to unwind its agreement with Amazon and establish its independent e-commerce website. The company was later awarded $51 million in damages.[56][57][58]\nIn 2001, Amazon entered into a similar agreement with Borders Group, under which Amazon would comanage Borders.com as a co-branded service.[59] Borders pulled out of the arrangement in 2007, with plans to also launch its own online store.[60]\nOn October 18, 2011, Amazon.com announced a partnership with DC Comics for the exclusive digital rights to many popular comics, including Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, The Sandman, and Watchmen. The partnership has caused well-known bookstores like Barnes & Noble to remove these titles from their shelves.[61]\nIn November 2013, Amazon announced a partnership with the United States Postal Service to begin delivering orders on Sundays. The service, included in Amazon's standard shipping rates, initiated in metropolitan areas of Los Angeles and New York because of the high-volume and inability to deliver in a timely way, with plans to expand into Dallas, Houston, New Orleans and Phoenix by 2014.[62]\nIn June 2017, Nike agreed to sell products through Amazon in exchange for better policing of counterfeit goods.[63][64] This proved unsuccessful and Nike withdrew from the partnership in November 2019.[64][65] Companies including IKEA and Birkenstock also stopped selling through Amazon around the same time, citing similar frustrations over business practices and counterfeit goods.[66]\nIn September 2017, Amazon ventured with one of its sellers JV Appario Retail owned by Patni Group which has recorded a total income of US$\u2009104.44\u2009million (\u20b9759 \u2009crore) in financial year 2017\u20132018.[67]\nAs of October\u00a011, 2017[update], AmazonFresh sold a range of Booths branded products for home delivery in selected areas.[68]\nIn November 2018, Amazon reached an agreement with Apple Inc. to sell selected products through the service, via the company and selected Apple Authorized Resellers. As a result of this partnership, only Apple Authorized Resellers may sell Apple products on Amazon effective January 4, 2019.[69][70]\nAmazon sells many products under its own brand names, including phone chargers, batteries, and diaper wipes. The AmazonBasics brand was introduced in 2009, and now features hundreds of product lines, including smartphone cases, computer mice, batteries, dumbbells, and dog crates. Amazon owned 34 private-label brands as of 2019. These brands account for 0.15% of Amazon's global sales, whereas the average for other large retailers is 18%.[71] Other Amazon retail brands include Presto!, Mama Bear, and Amazon Essentials.[72]\nAmazon derives many of its sales (around 40% in 2008) from third-party sellers who sell products on Amazon.[73] Some other large e-commerce sellers use Amazon to sell their products in addition to selling them through their websites. The sales are processed through Amazon.com and end up at individual sellers for processing and order fulfillment and Amazon leases space for these retailers. Small sellers of used and new goods go to Amazon Marketplace to offer goods at a fixed price.[74]\nPublishers can signup as affiliates and receive a commission for referring customers to Amazon by placing links to Amazon on their websites if the referral results in a sale. Worldwide, Amazon has \"over 900,000 members\" in its affiliate programs.[75] In the middle of 2014, the Amazon Affiliate Program is used by 1.2% of all websites and it is the second most popular advertising network after Google Ads.[76] It is frequently used by websites and non-profits to provide a way for supporters to earn them a commission.[77]\nAssociates can access the Amazon catalog directly on their websites by using the Amazon Web Services (AWS) XML service. A new affiliate product, aStore, allows Associates to embed a subset of Amazon products within another website, or linked to another website. In June 2010, Amazon Seller Product Suggestions was launched to provide more transparency to sellers by recommending specific products to third-party sellers to sell on Amazon. Products suggested are based on customers' browsing history.[78]\nAmazon allows users to submit reviews to the web page of each product. Reviewers must rate the product on a rating scale from one to five stars. Amazon provides a badging option for reviewers which indicates the real name of the reviewer (based on confirmation of a credit card account) or which indicates that the reviewer is one of the top reviewers by popularity. As of December 16, 2020, Amazon removed the ability of sellers and customers to comment on product reviews and purged their websites of all posted product review comments. In an email to sellers Amazon gave its rationale for removing this feature: \"... the comments feature on customer reviews was rarely used.\" The remaining review response options are to indicate whether the reader finds the review helpful or to report that it violates Amazon policies (abuse). If a review is given enough \"helpful\" hits, it appears on the front page of the product. In 2010, Amazon was reported as being the largest single source of Internet consumer reviews.[79]\nWhen publishers asked Bezos why Amazon would publish negative reviews, he defended the practice by claiming that Amazon.com was \"taking a different approach ... we want to make every book available\u2014the good, the bad and the ugly ... to let truth loose\".[80]\nThere have been cases of positive reviews being written and posted by public relations companies on behalf of their clients[81] and instances of writers using pseudonyms to leave negative reviews of their rivals' works\nThe Amazon sales rank (ASR) indicates the popularity of a product sold on any Amazon locale. It is a relative indicator of popularity that is updated hourly. Effectively, it is a \"best sellers list\" for the millions of products stocked by Amazon.[82] While the ASR has no direct effect on the sales of a product, it is used by Amazon to determine which products to include in its bestsellers lists.[82] Products that appear in these lists enjoy additional exposure on the Amazon website and this may lead to an increase in sales. In particular, products that experience large jumps (up or down) in their sales ranks may be included within Amazon's lists of \"movers and shakers\"; such a listing provides additional exposure that might lead to an increase in sales.[83] For competitive reasons, Amazon does not release actual sales figures to the public. However, Amazon has now begun to release point of sale data via the Nielsen BookScan service to verified authors.[84] While the ASR has been the source of much speculation by publishers, manufacturers, and marketers, Amazon itself does not release the details of its sales rank calculation algorithm. Some companies have analyzed Amazon sales data to generate sales estimates based on the ASR,[85] though Amazon states:\nPlease keep in mind that our sales rank figures are simply meant to be a guide of general interest for the customer and not definitive sales information for publishers\u2014we assume you have this information regularly from your distribution sources\nIn November 2015, Amazon opened a physical Amazon Books store in University Village in Seattle. The store is 5,500 square feet and prices for all products match those on its website.[87] Amazon opened its tenth physical book store in 2017;[88] media speculation suggests that Amazon plans to eventually roll out 300 to 400 bookstores around the country.[87]\nIn June 2018, it was reported that Amazon planned to open brick and mortar bookstores in Germany.[89]\nIn August 2019, Amazon applied to have a liquor store in San Francisco, CA as a means to ship beer and alcohol within the city.[90]\nIn 2020, Amazon Fresh opened several physical stores in the U.S. and the United Kingdom.[91]\nAmazon has a number of products and services available, including its digital assistant Alexa, Amazon Music and Prime Video for music and videos respectively, the Amazon Appstore for Android apps, and its Kindle hardware line of e-readers and tablets. Audible provides audiobooks for purchase and listening.\nIn September 2021, Amazon announced the launch of Astro, its first household robot, powered by its Alexa smart home technology. This can be remote-controlled when not at home, to check on pets, people, or home security. It will send owners a notification if it detects something unusual.[92]\nIn January 2023, Amazon announced the launch of RXPass, a prescription drug delivery service. It allows US Amazon Prime members to pay a $5 monthly fee for access to 60 medications. The service was launched immediately after the announcement except in states with specific prescription delivery requirements. Beneficiaries of government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid will not be able to sign up for RXPass.[93]\nAmazon owns over 40 subsidiaries, including Amazon Web Services, Audible, Diapers.com, Goodreads, IMDb, Kiva Systems (now Amazon Robotics), Shopbop, Teachstreet, Twitch, Zappos, and Zoox.[94]\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is a subsidiary of that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. These cloud computing web services provide distributed computing processing capacity and software tools via AWS server farms. As of 2021 Q4, AWS has 33% market share for cloud infrastructure while the next two competitors Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud have 21%, and 10% respectively, according to Synergy Group.[95][96]\nAudible is a seller and producer of spoken audio entertainment, information, and educational programming on the Internet. Audible sells digital audiobooks, radio and television programs, and audio versions of magazines and newspapers. Through its production arm, Audible Studios, Audible has also become the world's largest producer of downloadable audiobooks. On January 31, 2008, Amazon announced it would buy Audible for about $300\u00a0million. The deal closed in March 2008 and Audible became a subsidiary of Amazon.[97]\nGoodreads is a \"social cataloging\" website founded in December 2006 and launched in January 2007 by Otis Chandler, a software engineer, and entrepreneur, and Elizabeth Khuri. The website allows individuals to freely search Goodreads' extensive user-populated database of books, annotations, and reviews. Users can sign up and register books to generate library catalogs and reading lists. They can also create their groups of book suggestions and discussions. In December 2007, the site had over 650,000 members, and over a million books had been added. Amazon bought the company in March 2013.[98]\nRing is a home automation company founded by Jamie Siminoff in 2013. It is primarily known for its WiFi powered smart doorbells, but manufactures other devices such as security cameras. Amazon bought Ring for US$1\u00a0billion in 2018.[99]\nTwitch is a live streaming platform for video, primarily oriented towards video gaming content. Twitch was acquired by Amazon in August 2014 for $970\u00a0million.[100] The site's rapid growth had been boosted primarily by the prominence of major esports competitions on the service, leading GameSpot senior esports editor Rod Breslau to have described the service as \"the ESPN of esports\".[101] As of 2015[update], the service had over 1.5\u00a0million broadcasters and 100\u00a0million monthly viewers.[102]\nWhole Foods Market is an American supermarket chain exclusively featuring foods without artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, sweeteners, and hydrogenated fats.[103] Amazon acquired Whole Foods for $13.7 billion in August 2017.[104][105][9]\nOther Amazon subsidiaries include:\nAmazon also has investments in renewable energy and plans to expand its position into the Canadian market through an investment in a new plant in Alberta.[137]\nAmazon uses many different transportation services to deliver packages. Amazon-branded services include:\nAmazon directly employs people to work at its warehouses, bulk distribution centers, staffed \"Amazon Hub Locker+\" locations, and delivery stations where drivers pick up packages. As of December 2020, it is not hiring delivery drivers as employees.[140]\nRakuten Intelligence estimated that in 2020 in the United States, the proportion of last-mile deliveries was 56% by Amazon's directly contracted services (mostly in urban areas), 30% by the U.S. Postal Service (mostly in rural areas), and 14% by UPS.[141] In April 2021, Amazon reported to investors it had increased its in-house delivery capacity by 50% in the last 12 months (which included the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States).[142]\nAmazon first launched its distribution network in 1997 with two fulfillment centers in Seattle and New Castle, Delaware. Amazon has several types of distribution facilities consisting of cross-dock centers, fulfillment centers, sortation centers, delivery stations, Prime now hubs, and Prime air hubs. There are 75 fulfillment centers and 25 sortation centers with over 125,000 employees.[143][144] Employees are responsible for five basic tasks: unpacking and inspecting incoming goods; placing goods in storage and recording their location; picking goods from their computer recorded locations to make up an individual shipment; sorting and packing orders; and shipping. A computer that records the location of goods and maps out routes for pickers plays a key role: employees carry hand-held computers which communicate with the central computer and monitor their rate of progress. Some warehouses are partially automated with systems built by Amazon Robotics.\nIn September 2006, Amazon launched a program called FBA (Fulfillment By Amazon) whereby it could handle storage, packing and distribution of products and services for small sellers.[145]\nAmazon.fr fulfillment center in Lauwin-Planque, France\nAmazon.es fulfillment center in San Fernando de Henares, Spain\nAmazon.co.uk fulfillment center in Glenrothes, Scotland, UK\nAmazon.de fulfillment center in Graben, Germany\nAmazon.co.jp fulfillment center in Ichikawa, Japan\nAmazon fulfillment center in Macon, Georgia, U.S.\nAs of June\u00a02022[update], Amazon's board of directors were:[146]\nAmazon.com is primarily a retail site with a sales revenue model; Amazon takes a small percentage of the sale price of each item that is sold through its website while also allowing companies to advertise their products by paying to be listed as featured products.[147] As of 2018[update], Amazon.com is ranked eighth on the Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.[148]\nFor the fiscal year 2021, Amazon reported earnings of US$33.36\u00a0billion, with an annual revenue of US$469.82\u00a0billion, an increase of 21.7% over the previous fiscal cycle. Since 2007 sales increased from 14.835\u00a0billion to 469.822\u00a0billion, due to continued business expansion.[149]\nAmazon's market capitalization went over US$1\u00a0trillion again in early February 2020 after the announcement of the fourth quarter 2019 results.[150]\nDuring his tenure, Jeff Bezos had become renowned for his annual shareholder letters, which have gained similar notability to those of Warren Buffett.[168] These annual letters gave an \"invaluable window\" into the famously \"secretive\" company, and revealed Bezos's perspectives and strategic focus.[168][169] A common theme of these letters is Bezos's desire to instill customer-centricity (in his words, \"customer obsession\") at all levels of Amazon, notably by making all senior executives field customer support queries for a short time at Amazon call centers. He also read many emails addressed by customers to his public email address.[170] One of Bezos's most well-known internal memos was his mandate for \"all teams\" to \"expose their data and functionality\" through service interfaces \"designed from the ground up to be externalizable\". This process, commonly known as a service-oriented architecture (SOA), resulted in mandatory dogfooding of services that would later be commercialized as part of AWS.[citation needed]\nAmazon lobbies the United States federal government and state governments on multiple issues such as the enforcement of sales taxes on online sales, transportation safety, privacy and data protection and intellectual property. According to regulatory filings, Amazon.com focuses its lobbying on the United States Congress, the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Reserve. Amazon.com spent roughly $3.5\u00a0million, $5\u00a0million and $9.5\u00a0million on lobbying, in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively.[171] In 2019, it spent $16.8\u00a0million and had a team of 104 lobbyists.[172]\nAmazon.com was a corporate member of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) until it dropped membership following protests at its shareholders' meeting on May 24, 2012.[173]\nIn 2014, Amazon expanded its lobbying practices as it prepared to lobby the Federal Aviation Administration to approve its drone delivery program, hiring the Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld lobbying firm in June.[174] Amazon and its lobbyists have visited with Federal Aviation Administration officials and aviation committees in Washington, D.C. to explain its plans to deliver packages.[175] In September 2020 this moved one step closer with the granting of a critical certificate by the FAA.[176]\nAmazon has attracted criticism for its actions, including: supplying law enforcement with facial recognition surveillance tools;[177] forming cloud computing partnerships with the CIA;[178] leading customers away from bookshops;[179] adversely impacting the environment;[180] placing a low priority on warehouse conditions for workers;[181] actively opposing unionization efforts;[182] remotely deleting content purchased by Amazon Kindle users; taking public subsidies; seeking to patent its 1-Click technology; engaging in anti-competitive actions and price discrimination;[23][24] and reclassifying LGBT books as adult content.[183][184] Criticism has also concerned various decisions over whether to censor or publish content such as the WikiLeaks website, works containing libel and material facilitating dogfight, cockfight, or pedophile activities. In December 2011, Amazon faced a backlash from small businesses for running a one-day deal to promote its new Price Check app. Shoppers who used the app to check prices in a brick-and-mortar store were offered a 5% discount to purchase the same item from Amazon.[185] Companies like Groupon, eBay and Taap.it countered Amazon's promotion by offering $10 off from their products.[186][187]\nThe company has also faced accusations of putting undue pressure on suppliers to maintain and extend its profitability. One effort to squeeze the most vulnerable book publishers was known within the company as the Gazelle Project, after Bezos suggested, according to Brad Stone, \"that Amazon should approach these small publishers the way a cheetah would pursue a sickly gazelle.\"[52] In July 2014, the Federal Trade Commission launched a lawsuit against the company alleging it was promoting in-app purchases to children, which were being transacted without parental consent.[188] In 2019, Amazon banned selling skin-lightening and racist products that might affect the consumer's health.[189] In 2022, a lawsuit filed by state attorney-general Letitia James was dismissed by the New York state court of appeals.[190]", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "

Wikipedia": {"text": "Whole Foods Market IP, Inc., a subsidiary of Amazon, is an American multinational supermarket chain headquartered in Austin, Texas, which sells products free from hydrogenated fats and artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives.[5] A USDA Certified Organic grocer in the United States, the chain is popularly known for its organic selections.[6] Whole Foods has 500 stores in North America and seven in the United Kingdom as of March\u00a04, 2019[update].[3][7]\nAmazon acquired the company for $13.7 billion on August 28, 2017.[8]\nIn 1978, John Mackey and Renee Lawson borrowed $45,000 from family and friends to open a small vegetarian natural foods store called SaferWay in Austin, Texas (the name being a spoof of Safeway). When the two were evicted for storing food products in their apartment, they decided to live at the store. Because it was zoned for commercial use, there was no shower stall, so they bathed using a water hose attached to their dishwasher.[9][10][11]\nTwo years later, Mackey and Lawson partnered with Craig Weller and Mark Skiles to merge SaferWay with the latter's Clarksville Natural Grocery, resulting in the opening of the original Whole Foods Market, which included meat products. At 10,500 square feet (980\u00a0m2) and with a staff of 19, the store was large in comparison to the standard health food store of the time.[12]\nOn May 25, 1981, the most damaging flood in 70 years devastated Austin. Whole Foods' inventory was ruined, and most of the equipment was damaged. The loss was approximately $400,000, and Whole Foods Market had no insurance. Customers, neighbors, and staff assisted in repairing and cleaning up the damage. Creditors, vendors, and investors assisted in the recovery, and the store reopened 28 days later.[12]\nBeginning in 1984, Whole Foods Market expanded from Austin, first to Houston and Dallas and then to New Orleans with the purchase of The Whole Food Co. in 1988. In 1989, the company expanded to the West Coast with a store in Palo Alto, California.\nThe company made its initial public offering on January 23, 1992.[14]\nWhile opening new stores, the company fueled rapid growth by acquiring other natural foods chains throughout the 1990s: Wellspring Grocery of North Carolina, Bread & Circus of Massachusetts, and Rhode Island (banner retired in 2003), Mrs. Gooch's Natural Foods Markets of Los Angeles,[15] Bread of Life of Northern California, Fresh Fields Markets on the East Coast and in the Midwest, Florida Bread of Life stores, Detroit-area Merchant of Vino stores, and Nature's Heartland of Boston.[16] The company purchased Allegro Coffee Company in 1997.[17] The company's 100th store was opened in Torrance, California, in 1999.[18]\nThe company started its third decade with additional acquisitions. The first was Natural Abilities in 2000, which did business as Food for Thought in Northern California.[19] After the departure of then company president Chris Hitt and regional president Rich Cundiff, Southern California region, John Mackey promoted A. C. Gallo, president of the Northeast region, and Walter Robb, president of the Northern California region to co-COO and soon after added the titles of co-president. This led to the promotion of three new regional presidents and a new era for the company. David Lannon became president of the Northeast region, Anthony Gilmore became president of the Southwest region, and Ron Megehan became the Northern California region, president. In 2001, Whole Foods also moved into Manhattan.[20] Later that year, Ken Meyer became president of the newly formed South region and Whole Foods Market acquired the assets of Harry's Farmers Market, which included three stores in Atlanta.[21] In 2002, the company continued its expansion in North America and opened its first store in Toronto, Ontario.[22] Further continuing its expansion, Select Fish of Seattle was acquired in 2003.[23]\nIn late 2004, it was reported that Whole Foods had \"cleared $188 million in profits in the last two years.\"[24]\nIn 2005, Whole Foods opened its 80,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (7,400\u00a0m2) flagship store in downtown Austin. The company's headquarters moved into offices above the store.[25]\nWhole Foods opened its first store in Hawaii in 2008[26] and in 2008 it also opened a southeast distribution center in Braselton, Georgia, calling it the first \"green distribution center\" for the company.[27]\nAlong with new acquisitions, such as the 2014 purchase of seven Dominick's Finer Foods locations in Chicago, Whole Foods has also sold stores to other companies.[28] For example, 35 Henry's Farmers Market and Sun Harvest Market stores were sold to a subsidiary of Los Angeles grocer Smart & Final Inc. for $166 million in 2007.[29]\nWhole Foods opened its second store in western New York in Amherst, a suburb of Buffalo in September 2017.[30]\nAs part of a streamlining campaign, in January 2017, the company reported that it would close three remaining regional kitchens in Everett, Landover and Atlanta.[31]\nIn June 2017, Amazon purchased Whole Foods Market for $13.7 billion.[32] Amazon plans for Whole Foods customers who also have an Amazon prime account to be able to order groceries online and then pick them up in store for free.[33]\nIn January 2019, to facilitate expansion into previously unserved areas, Amazon announced plans to acquire some former Sears and Kmart locations from Sears Holdings, which filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy protection on October 15, 2018. These vacant locations would be demolished or remodeled to create new Whole Foods Market locations.[34][35]\nIn April 2019, Whole Foods opened its largest store in the Southeast in Midtown Atlanta. The three-level store has a burger restaurant, an Allegro Coffee shop, and a rooftop terrace.[36]\nWhole Foods entered the Canadian market in 2002 in Toronto.[37] In 2013, Whole Foods said it would open around 40 more stores in Canada over time. At the time, there were 9 Whole Foods in Canada.[38] By January 2017, Whole Foods had 467 stores, all of which were in the United States except 9 in the United Kingdom and 12 in Canada. In January 2017, Whole Foods announced it was canceling plans from 2015 and 2016 to open stores in Calgary and Edmonton.[39] Among the twelve were five each in Greater Vancouver and Greater Toronto, and one each in Ottawa and Victoria.[39]  In March 2020 there were 487 stores in the US, 14 in Canada and 7 in the UK.[7]\nIn 2004, Whole Foods Market entered the UK by acquiring seven Fresh & Wild stores.[16][40] In June 2007, it opened its first full-size store, a total of 80,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (7,400\u00a0m2) on three levels, on the site of the old Barkers department store on Kensington High Street, West London and currently their largest store in the world. Company executives claimed that as many as forty stores might eventually be opened throughout the UK.[41] However, by September 2008, in the wake of Whole Foods Market's financial troubles, Fresh & Wild had been reduced to four stores, all in London. The flagship Bristol branch closed because it had \"not met profitability goals.\"[42] In the year to September 28, 2008, the UK subsidiary lost \u00a336 million due to a large impairment charge of \u00a327 million and poor trading results due to the growing fears of a global recession.[43] However, in 2011, global sales grew +8% each financial quarter as shoppers returned to the chain.[44] A first Scottish store was opened on November 16, 2011, in Giffnock, Glasgow, which was closed in November 2017 along with the company's Cheltenham store as part of a rationalization plan.[45][46] Whole Foods Market Inc. currently operates seven different Whole Foods locations: in Camden Town, Clapham Junction, Kensington, Piccadilly Circus, Richmond, Stoke Newington and Fulham.[47]\nOn February 21, 2007, Whole Foods Market, Inc. and Wild Oats Markets Inc. announced the signing of a merger agreement under which Whole Foods Market, Inc. would acquire Wild Oats Markets Inc.'s outstanding common stock in a cash tender offer of $18.50 per share, or approximately $565 million based on fully diluted shares. Under the agreement, Whole Foods Market, Inc. would also assume Wild Oats Markets Inc.'s net debt totaling approximately $106 million as reported on September 30, 2006.[48]\nOn June 27, 2007, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued an administrative complaint challenging Whole Foods Market, Inc.'s acquisition of Wild Oats Markets Inc. According to the complaint, the FTC believed that the proposed transaction would violate federal antitrust laws by eliminating the substantial competition between two close competitors in the operation of premium natural and organic supermarkets nationwide. The FTC contended that if the transaction were to proceed, Whole Foods Market would have the ability to raise prices and reduce quality and services. Both Whole Foods Market and Wild Oats stated their intention to oppose the FTC's complaint vigorously, and a court hearing on the issue was scheduled for July 31 and August 1, 2007. CEO John Mackey started a blog Archived 2015-02-14 at the Wayback Machine on the subject to explain his opposition to the FTC's stance. Further blogging by Mackey was revealed when the FTC released papers detailing highly opinionated comments under the pseudonym \"Rahodeb\" that he made to the Whole Foods Yahoo! investment message board. This became the subject of an investigation when the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) noted that the Regulation Fair Disclosure law of 2000 may have been violated.[49][50] The SEC cleared Mackey of the charges on April 25, 2008.[51]\nOn July 29, 2008, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia overturned the district court's decision to allow the merger. The Court of Appeals ruled that \"premium natural, and organic supermarkets\" (\"PNOS\"), such as Whole Foods and Wild Oats, constitute a distinct submarket of all grocers. The court ruled that \"mission-driven\" consumers (those with an emphasis on social and environmental responsibility) would be adversely affected by the merger because substantial evidence by the FTC showed that Whole Foods intended to raise prices after the consummation of the merger.[52] As part of its effort to combat the ruling, Whole Foods subpoenaed financial records, market studies, and future strategic plans belonging to New Seasons Market, a regional competitor based in the Portland area.[53][54] In 2009, Whole Foods agreed to sell the Wild Oats chain.[55]\nIn February 2017, Whole Foods Market said it would close nine stores and lowered its financial projections for the year as the natural-foods company struggled with increased competition and slowing sales growth.[citation needed] In late April 2017, Whole Foods reported their sixth consecutive quarter of declining sales and announced that the company would be closing nine stores: two each in Colorado and California, and one each in Georgia, Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, and Illinois. The loss of revenue was attributed to foot traffic being down and other supermarkets offering a similar experience for a lower cost.[56]\nOn June 15, 2017, Amazon announced it would acquire Whole Foods Market,[57][58] adding some 400 physical stores to Amazon's e-commerce assets.[59] The purchase was valued at $13.7 billion and caused Whole Foods's stock price to soar after the announcement was made.[60]\nIn 2018, Whole Foods Market announced its possible intention to take over some vacant Sears and Kmart stores and refurbish them after Sears Holdings Corporation, which owned both chains, filed for bankruptcy in October.[61]\nIn April 2022, Whole Foods in Austin, Texas began allowing consumers to make purchases by scanning their palms. The system uses the Amazon One system connected to a customer's debit or credit card.[62]\nOn September 1, 2022, John Mackey stepped down from his position as chief executive officer (CEO) of the company, one he held since its inception in 1980.[63] Jason Buechel succeeded him. Buechel previously served as executive vice president and chief information officer (CIO) between 2013 and 2019, followed by a tenure as chief operating officer (COO) from 2019 until his promotion in 2022.\nWhole Foods Market sells only products that meet its self-created quality standards for being \"natural,\" which the store defines as minimally processed foods that are free of hydrogenated fats as well as artificial flavors, colors, sweeteners, preservatives, and many others as listed on their online \"Unacceptable Food Ingredients\" list.[64] Whole Foods Market has also announced that it does not intend to sell meat or milk from cloned animals or their offspring, even though the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has ruled them safe to eat.[65][66]\nThe company also sells many USDA-certified organic foods and products that aim to be environmentally friendly and ecologically responsible. Stores do not carry foie gras or eggs from hens confined to battery cages due to animal cruelty concerns as a result of successful advocacy by animal welfare groups. The Whole Foods Market website details the company's criteria for selling food, dietary supplements, and personal care products.[64]\nUntil June 2011, body care products sold at Whole Foods Market could be marketed as organic even if they contained ingredients not listed by the USDA as acceptable for use in organic food.[67] \"Products made using petroleum-derived and other synthetic or chemical ingredients, prohibited in organic foods, can be found among the organic shampoos and lotions made by Avalon, Nature's Gate, Jason Natural Cosmetics, Kiss My Face and other brands,\" said Urvashi Rangan, an environmental health scientist at Consumer Reports. This is because the federal guidelines that regulate organic food labeling do not apply to cosmetics.[68] Starting in June 2011, personal care products sold at Whole Foods Market were required to follow the same USDA National Organic Program standards for organic food. This required products labeled \"Organic\" to contain 95 percent or more certified organic ingredients.[67]\nIn a Wall Street Journal article in August 2009, John Mackey acknowledged that his company had lost touch with its natural food roots and would attempt to reconnect with the idea that health was affected by the quality of food consumed. He said, \"We sell a bunch of junk.\" He stated that the company would focus more on health education in its stores.[69] As of 2013, many stores have employed Healthy Eating Specialists who are team members who \"answer customers\u2019 healthy eating questions and can assist...in choosing the most nutrient-dense ingredients, suggest satisfying healthy recipes,\" and help \"create a meal plan in keeping with your health goals.\"[70]\nWhole Foods Market has developed several in-store rating systems for various departments to allow their customers full transparency in purchasing. The Seafood department has a Sustainability Rating System for wild-caught seafood[71] while farm-raised seafood has to meet aquaculture standards[72] both rated in accordance to third-party auditors. The Meat department has a rating system in partnership with the Global Animal Partnership based on animal welfare.[73] The produce department has a rating system based on farming practices which include measures of a farm's environment, GMO transparency, worker safety, and wage practices.[74] The grocery department has an Eco-scale rating system for its cleaning products which measures their environmental impact.[75] Each system is in place to allow customers to make the most educated choices within Whole Foods Market. There are efforts to create more rating systems in other departments.[76]\nWhole Foods Market has announced plans to provide its customers GMO (genetically modified organism) product labeling by 2018.[77] Efforts of GMO transparency run the gamut of each department. For years, Non-GMO Project Verified items have been sought in Grocery.[77] While efforts continue in Produce, Whole Foods recommends buying organic or referring to their \"Responsibly Grown produce rating system [which] requires growers to disclose the use of GMO seeds or plant material.\"[77] In Seafood, plans are being made to launch a Non-GMO Project Verification process for farm-raised fish.[77] Currently, there are no USDA Organic regulations for farmed seafood.[78]\nWhole Foods Market purchases products for retail sale from local, regional, and international wholesale suppliers and vendors. Most purchasing occurs at the regional and national levels to negotiate volume discounts with major vendors and distributors. Regional and store buyers focus on local products and any unique products necessary to ensure a neighborhood market feel. Whole Foods says that the company is committed to buying from local producers that meet its quality standards while also increasingly focusing more of their purchasing on producer- and manufacture-direct programs.[79] Some regions have an employee known as a \"forager,\" whose sole duty is to source local products for each store.[80]\nIn April 2007, Whole Foods Market launched the Whole Trade Guarantee, a purchasing initiative emphasizing ethics and social responsibility concerning products imported from the developing world. The criteria include fair prices for crops, environmentally sound practices, better wages and labor conditions for workers, and the stipulation that one percent of proceeds from Whole Trade-certified products go to the Whole Planet Foundation to support micro-loan programs in developing countries. The company's goal, published in 2007, is to have at least half of its imported products from these countries fully certified by 2017.[81][82]\nWhole Foods Market has a policy of donating at least five percent of its annual net profits to charitable causes. Some of this mandate is accomplished through store-level donations held on certain \"5% days\" throughout the year. The rest of it comes from various targeted projects by the company.[83]\nIn May 1999, Whole Foods Market joined the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), a global independent, not-for-profit organization promoting sustainable fisheries and responsible fishing practices worldwide to help preserve fish stocks for future generations.[84] The company first began selling MSC-certified seafood in 2000, and a growing selection of MSC-certified fish continues to be available.[85]\nWhole Foods placed third on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's \"Top 25 Green Power Partners\". The company also received the EPA Green Power Award in 2004 and 2005 and the Partner of the Year award in 2006 and 2007.[86] A January 8, 2007, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) report listed Whole Foods Market as the second-highest purchaser of green power nationwide, citing its actions as helping drive the development of new renewable energy sources for the electricity generation. The EPA report showed Whole Foods Market using 463.1 million kilowatt hours annually. It was covered, 100 percent net-wise, by its total electricity from biomass, geothermal, small hydro, solar, and wind sources.[87]\nWhole Foods signed an agreement with SolarCity to install solar panels on up to 100 stores.[88]\nIn January 2008, Whole Foods Market was the first U.S. supermarket to commit to eliminating disposable plastic grocery bags to help protect the environment and conserve resources, and many stores serve as a collection point for shoppers to recycle their plastic bags.[89]\nOn Earth Day, April 22, 2008, the chain eliminated the use of disposable plastic grocery bags company-wide at point-of-purchase[90] in favor of reusable bags or paper bags made from recycled paper. The company also began offering \"Better Bags,\" large, colorful grocery bags made primarily from recycled bottles. The move from the traditional paper/plastic system to reusable bags has been packaged as an initiative the company calls \"BYOB \u2013 Bring Your Own Bag.\"[91] The campaign is aimed at reducing pollution by eliminating plastic bags and reducing waste by encouraging bag reuse with \"bag refunds\" of 5\u201310 cents, depending on the store.\nHowever, it still offers single-use plastic bags in its produce department and does little to discourage persistent use by customers and Amazon Prime Now shoppers alike.[92]\nIn 2002, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals began petitioning Whole Foods to improve the treatment of animals sold in the stores.\nWhole Foods created the Animal Compassion Foundation in January 2005; on December 5, 2014, the organization[93] registration was canceled nonprofit organization, to help other producers evolve their practices to raise animals naturally and humanely. According to Whole Foods Natural Meat Quality Standards and Animal Compassionate Standards, pulling feathers from live ducks, bill trimming, bill heat treatment, toe punching, slitting the webs of the feet, and toe removal are prohibited in the raising of ducks for Whole Foods Market. Any ducks treated in this manner, treated with antibiotics or antimicrobials, cloned, genetically modified, or not allowed medical treatment when necessary are to be removed from Whole Foods Market stock.[66]\nIn January 2004, in California, the Environmental Working Group and the Center for Environmental Health presented a notice of intent to file an anti-toxin lawsuit against salmon producers. This was in large part due to Whole Foods' involvement, including highlighting the company's failure to warn consumers the fish contained potentially dangerous levels of cancer-causing chemicals known as PCBs.[94][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]\nIn February 2006, shareholders of Whole Foods filed a resolution asking Whole Foods to report toxic chemicals found in its products.[95] Substances such as Bisphenol A (BPA), found in products such as baby bottles and children's cups, are controversial. Whole Foods no longer sells baby bottles and children's cups made with BPA.[96]\nWhole Foods Market is considered anti-labor by most worker organizations, and it has been criticized that its products may not be as progressive as they are touted to be. Author Michael Pollan has contended that the supermarket chain has done well in expanding the organic market but has done so at the cost of local foods, regional producers, and distributors.[98] Parts of the debate have taken place publicly through a series of letters between Pollan and Whole Foods Market CEO John Mackey.[99]\nWhole Foods announced in June 2006 that it would stop selling live lobsters and crabs, but in February 2007, made an exception for a Portland, Maine store for its ability to meet \"humane standards.\" The lobsters are kept in private compartments instead of being piled on top of one another in a tank, and employees use a device that gives them a 120-volt shock so that they are not boiled alive in a pot of water.[100] This decision was criticized by ex-lobsterman Trevor Corson as damaging a New England tradition and as removing people's connection to where their food comes from.[101] In 2022, Whole Foods said it would temporarily stop selling Maine lobsters due to sustainability issues and a possible risk to whales.[102]\nRonnie Cummins, national director of the United States Organic Consumers Association, opined that \"Whole Foods Market now is a big-box retailer \u2013 and it's much more concerned about competing with the other big boxes than issues of ethics and sustainability.\"[103] Similarly, researcher Stacy Mitchell of the New Rules Project argues that the corporation's aggressive marketing of local food is more hype than substance.[104]\nWhole Foods has frequently been the subject of resistance or boycotts in response to proposed store locations.[105][106][107][108] The corporation has also been criticized for its aggressive policy of promoting its own in-house brands (e.g. 365) at the expense of smaller or local independent brands.[104]\nOn August 11, 2009, Whole Foods CEO John Mackey published an editorial in The Wall Street Journal criticizing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act;[109] the editorial was controversial in the natural foods community.[110]\nThe company has created other controversies at various times involving business practices, labor issues, product selection, and failure to support farmers and suppliers.[111] In March 2013, Whole Foods promised to label GMO-containing products in North American stores by 2018.[112] The company has drawn criticism for questionable science behind the claims of benefit of its products,[113][114] including encouraging and selling drugs that are described to work under homeopathic principles.\nIn 2013, two workers in Albuquerque, New Mexico, were suspended for speaking Spanish. The resulting investigation revealed that Whole Foods has a policy of speaking \"English to customers and other Team Members while on the clock.\"[115][116] The company soon revised its policy.[117]\nIn 2014, the company agreed to pay an $800,000 settlement in response to allegations that its California stores were charging more per weight than what its labels indicated.[118] Whole Foods continued this practice despite the settlement, with investigators alleging thousands of continued violations well into 2015.[119] In 2015, the CEOs made a public admission of this happening in New York after a New York City Department of Consumer Affairs investigation.[120]\nWhole Foods has faced lawsuits in California over the presence of carcinogens. In March 2008, following a study by the Organic Consumers Association, reports of high levels of 1,4-Dioxane found in body care products at Whole Foods prompted the Attorney General of California to file a lawsuit against the company for a violation of Proposition 65.[121] Civil penalties of up to $2,500 a day were expected to be awarded. The action claimed that 365, along with brands sold by other cosmetic companies, did not include a label warning about the chemical; spokesperson Libba Letton stated that the company did \"not believe that these products represent a health risk or are in excess of California's Proposition 65 Safe Harbor level for 1,4-Dioxane\" while consumer activist David Steinman urged them \"to stop treating the inclusion of cancer-causing chemicals in their products as 'business as usual.'\" [121][122] Proposition 65 was invoked again in 2013 when the state sued Whole Foods, and other retailers over the presence of lead in certain candies.[123]\nIn May 2014, Whole Foods launched a pilot program to sell rabbit meat in 5 of its 12 market regions.[124] Because domestic rabbits are the eighth most common pet in the United States[125] as well as an animal rescued and sheltered alongside cats and dogs, this decision triggered a nationwide boycott of Whole Foods by the vegetarian activist House Rabbit Society and their supporters.[126] In June 2014 Whole Foods awarded a financial grant to Oz Family Farms,[127] a family-owned rabbit meat business.\nIn January 2015, a group of activists organized under the network Direct Action Everywhere (DxE) released a video of laying hens from a Northern California farm that supplies eggs to Whole Foods. In the video, which featured footage of crowded, dirty henhouses and injured birds, DxE contended that the hens' welfare was severely compromised, even though numerous boards had labeled the farm as \"Certified Humane.\"[128]\nIn 2015, animal rights groups People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals and Direct Action Everywhere released investigations criticizing Whole Foods animal welfare standards and accusing Whole Foods suppliers of animal cruelty.[129][130] After the release of its investigation, PETA reversed its previous support for Whole Foods' animal welfare rating system, writing that \"Under the guise of compassion, Whole Foods is profiting from violence against animals.\"[131] PETA co-founder Ingrid Newkirk criticized Whole Foods' animal welfare approach based on the DxE and PETA investigations, arguing that supposed welfare failures indicate a need for animal rights rather than welfare.[132][133] Whole Foods has come under harsh criticism from abolitionist vegans such as Gary L. Francione who view the company's policies as a betrayal of the animal rights position.[134]\nIn January 2016, SJ Collins Enterprises, a developer who often works with Whole Foods, petitioned the Sarasota County board of county commissioners to allow the removal of a 5-acre protected wetlands[135][136] so that they could build a surface parking lot for a planned Whole Foods shopping center and Wawa gas station at the intersection of University Parkway and Honore Avenue. The county commission voted 4\u20131 to allow the re-zoning and accept 41 acres of replacement wetlands.[137] The lone commissioner voting against the proposal, Charles Hines, stated that approval of the petition could create a domino effect leading to the destruction of other protected areas.[138][139][140]\nIn June 2016, US food safety inspectors warned the company that violations discovered at Whole Foods' Everett, Massachusetts plant could result in food being \"contaminated with filth or rendered injurious to health.\"[31]\nIn April 2018, Whole Foods Market faced social media backlash over the opening of the third location of the independent restaurant chain, \"Yellow Fever,\" in a Whole Foods 365 store in Long Beach, California, for possible racist undertones.[141]\nIn April 2020, Business Insider revealed extensive monitoring of stores to identify and target unionization, using a metric based on racial diversity, employee loyalty, turnover and more.[142]\nIn June 2020, two Whole Foods employees said they were sent home for wearing masks that stated \"I can't breathe\" and \"Black Lives Matter.\"[143] A Whole Foods spokesperson stated that, \"[a]ll Whole Foods Market Team Members have signed acknowledgments of our longstanding company dress code, which prohibits any visible slogans, messages, logos or advertising that are not company-related, on any article of clothing, including face masks.\"[143]\nIn November 2020, Whole Foods banned Canadian employees from wearing a Remembrance Day poppy, the national symbol of remembrance worn by Canadians on Remembrance Day.[144][145] On November 6, 2020, the House of Commons of Canada unanimously adopted a motion \"to condemn Whole Foods and its owner Jeff Bezos for banning its employees from wearing poppies on their uniform\".[146] The same day, Whole Foods reversed its policy, saying \"Given the learnings of today, we are welcoming Team Members to wear the poppy pin in honour of Remembrance Day.\"[147]\nWhole Foods Market was included in Fortune magazine's annual list of the \"100 Best Companies to Work For\"[148] yearly from the list's inception in 1998 to being placed number 44 in 2014.[149] The chain has also won a number of awards for social responsibility including a first-place ranking by Harris Interactive / The Wall Street Journal in 2006[150] and British trade magazine The Grocer named it the \"World's Greatest Food Retailer\" the same year.[151][152] It has received past spots on the \"100 Best Corporate Citizens\" list published by Corporate Responsibility Officer.[153] In 2014, Supermarket News ranked Whole Foods number 19 on its list of \"Top 75 North American Retailers.\"[154]\nAmong its core values, the company lists \"supporting team member happiness and excellence.\"[155] The company maintains that its treatment of workers obviates the need for labor unions: At its U.S. stores, after 800 service hours, full-time workers are given an option to purchase health insurance coverage starting at $20 per paycheck for themselves, and spouse and dependent coverage for an additional charge.[156] Workers also have access to a company-funded personal wellness account, and the starting pay at most stores is highly competitive.[157]\nWhole Foods' health insurance plan is notable for its high deductibles \u2013 $2000 for general medical expenses and $1000 for prescriptions. However, employees receive $300 to $1800 per year (depending on years of service) in personal wellness funds. Once an employee has met the deductibles, insurance covers 80% of general medical costs and prescriptions but not for any type of mental illness.[158] CEO Mackey drew attention to the insurance program (offered through United Health Care in the US) for its employees in an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal.[109] In the article he called his company's insurance plan a viable alternative to \"Obamacare\". Mackey summed up his antipathy toward universal coverage in his op-ed by stating:\nA careful reading of both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution will not reveal any intrinsic right to health care, food, or shelter. That's because there isn't any. This \"right\" has never existed in America.\nA \"Boycott Whole Foods\" page on Facebook was created in response to John Mackey's position on health care.[159]\nMackey, a libertarian, believes that unions facilitate an adversarial relationship between management and labor.[11][160] An attempt at unionizing in Madison, Wisconsin in 2002 was met with resistance from store management, and Labor activists accused whole Foods of union busting. Employees at the Madison store voted in favor of unionization. Whole Foods then refused to bargain with its employees. After a year, the company moved to decertify the union. Further attempts at unionizing Whole Foods Market stores have been unsuccessful. Whole Foods launched a nationwide campaign, requiring workers to attend \"Union Awareness Training,\" complete with PowerPoint presentations.[161]\nWhole Foods was criticized for its refusal to support a campaign by the United Farm Workers (UFW) on behalf of agricultural workers laboring on strawberry farms.[162] During the late 1990s, the UFW persuaded several supermarket chains to sign a pledge in support of improved wages and working conditions for strawberry pickers. Whole Foods chose instead to support the farm workers indirectly by holding a \"National 5% Day\" where five percent of that day's sales \u2013 $125,000 \u2013 was donated to organizations that provide social services to farmworkers.[163]\nOn September 28, 2015, Whole Foods announced layoffs of 1,500 jobs, 1.6 percent of its workforce, to lower prices. Over the next two months, the eliminated jobs would come from regional and store positions.[164]\nWhole Foods hired the Labor Relations Consulting or \"union busting\" company Kulture Consulting, LLC on May 23, 2016. This was in response to a union election at a Whole Foods distribution center in Florida.[165] A member of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) wrote that Kulture's CEO and founder Peter List had \"in his effort to 'persuade' workers...engaged in 'patently unlawful' activities\" during a 2007 organizing campaign.[166]\nIn September 2019, Whole Foods announced it would cut the health benefits of part-time workers, affecting 2% of the workforce or 1,900 employees.[167]\nWhole Foods Market consists of twelve geographic regions, each with its own president, regional administrative team, store-level leadership, and store-level team members. A 4-tier hierarchy of employment exists within the Whole Foods Company: Store Employment, Facilities Employment, Regional Offices, and Global Headquarters.\nTo help employees learn about products, the company has instituted a mentoring program and developed an online portal called \"Whole Foods Market University\" to aid in training. Internal parlance refers to \"team leaders\" instead of \"managers,\" and stores sometimes offer prizes for competing teams.[168] A 2014 analysis of 2012 figures found that Whole Foods Market was \"among the least generous companies\" in terms of its 401(k) savings program.[169]\nWhole Foods Market has an employee discount; while all employees are provided a standard base discount rate of 20% on all store purchases, higher rates, up to 30%, can be earned based on employee physical fitness health tests that are given yearly.[170] These fitness exams are taken at the option of the employee.\nWhole Foods Market is composed of seventeen companies, each specializing in a different product. In the 1990s, while new stores were being opened, other natural food chain stores were being acquired for horizontal integration. This led to the Federal Trade Commission challenging the eventual merger with Wild Oats on the basis that it violated antitrust laws, essentially eliminating competition and inflating prices in the health foods market.[171]\nWhole Foods Market is based on a system of decentralized buying. Each vendor is approved at the regional level for corporate standards such as being non-GMO and fair trade.[172] Individual stores then decide which approved products to stock. They have a rolling ten-year distribution arrangement with UNFI.[173]\nIn June 2015, the company announced a millennial-focused, and more affordable version of its regular stores, called \"365 By Whole Foods Market\".[175][176][177] In addition to using digital price tags, in-store communication will largely be done through a smartphone app. In addition, the stores will have the goal of zero waste, donating all leftover food and using LED lights, as well as carbon dioxide-powered refrigeration cases.[178] Jeff Turnas is president of the division.[179]\nTo cut costs, customers unload bulkier products directly off a pallet.[180] Some items, like produce, are priced per item instead of by weight. For items sold by weight, the customers weigh, barcode, and tag those items before they reach the check-out counter. Unlike regular stores, 365 stores offer a rewards program.[181]\nThe first 365 By Whole Foods Market store opened in May 2016 in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles.[182][183][184] A second location opened two months later in Lake Oswego, Oregon,[180][185] followed by a third store two months after that in Bellevue, Washington.[186][187] In April 2017, a fourth location opened in Cedar Park, Texas.[188][189] In August 2017, a fifth location was opened in Santa Monica, California.[190][191] In September 2017, a sixth location was opened in Akron, Ohio.[192] In January 2018, a seventh location was opened in Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York.[193] The eighth location for the chain was opened in April 2018 in Long Beach, California,[194] followed by the opening of the ninth location a month later in Upland, California.[195][196] A tenth store was opened in the Independence Heights district of Houston, Texas, in August 2018.[197] In December 2018, the eleventh and twelfth stores were opened at almost the same time in the Buckhead district of Atlanta and in Decatur, Georgia.[174]\nThere were other future locations that would include five 365 stores in Illinois,[198] Indiana,[199][200] Ohio, Georgia, and Florida.[181]\nAlthough there were as many as twenty-two 365 stores under various stages of construction by early July 2017, progress at most of these construction sites came to a halt upon the news of the possible acquisition of the parent company by Amazon, and there was no information at the time if and when the construction at any of the building sites would resume.[201][202][203] As a result of the firm's merger with Amazon, Whole Foods canceled the continuation of work at the construction sites for at least two 365 stores. In January 2018, the Fresh Thyme Farmers Market chain announced that they were taking over the abandoned 365 store construction site at College Mall in Bloomington, Indiana to open a second Bloomington-area store.[204] In the same month, the City of Los Alamitos, California announced the abandonment of a shopping development that a 365 store would have anchored.[205]\nIn reviewing the new retail format, a reporter for The Motley Fool wrote that the new stores were \"closer to a combination of a fruit stand, convenience store, and a restaurant than a traditional grocery store\"[206] while a MarketWatch reporter called them \"hipster havens\" due to their use of high tech as a cost-cutting and efficiency measure.[207] Most reviews were very positive, although some customers said that they missed talking to actual people when placing food orders via tablets.[208]\nIn January 2019, it was announced that the 365 by Whole Foods Market concept would be discontinued, but the existing locations would remain open.[209] The following month, it was announced that all existing 365 stores would be converted into regular Whole Foods stores by the end of the year.[210]", "links":

{"text": "Safeway, Inc. is an American supermarket chain founded by Marion Barton Skaggs in April 1915 in American Falls, Idaho. The chain provides grocery items, food and general merchandise and features a variety of specialty departments, such as bakery, delicatessen, floral and pharmacy, as well as Starbucks coffee shops and fuel centers.[2] It is a subsidiary of Albertsons after being acquired by private equity investors led by Cerberus Capital Management in January 2015. Safeway's primary base of operations is in the Western United States[3] with some stores located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the Eastern Seaboard. The subsidiary is headquartered in Pleasanton, California, with its parent company, Albertsons, headquartered in Boise, Idaho.\nSafeway stores operate under the logo of a stylized white \"S\" inside a rounded red square with the slogan \"Ingredients for life\". Following the organics trend, the stores have expanded the number of organic fruits and vegetables in the produce section and offer other items under the \"O Organics\" label. Stores may have a Starbucks, a deli counter, a meat department, a produce section, a flower department, a bakery, a pharmacy, a liquor section, and/or many aisles of nonperishable items. The stores offer many in-house private label brands as well as name brands across all product categories.\nIn 1915, S.M. Skaggs, a Baptist minister, was convinced that the prevailing system of allowing customers to buy food from stores on credit increased prices, because grocers and storekeepers had to wait to get paid, and it made the customers overly dependent on those grocers and storekeepers. He described selling items on credit as \"the growing evil of installment purchasing\".[4] S.M. Skaggs established a store in American Falls, Idaho called Skaggs, and he sold groceries for cash at the time of sale. Skaggs was also against the prevailing high-cost system of the grocer having clerks serving all the needs of each customer. He was an early proponent of the self-service concept. Items were kept within the customers' reach, on shelves that hugged the walls, with aisles clear for customers to walk comfortably. Customers picked up baskets as they entered the store, selected what they wanted from the shelves, and paid for their purchases at a checkout counter.[5][6]\nWhen S.M. Skaggs decided he wanted to focus on his Baptist ministry, his son M.B. Skaggs purchased the grocery store from him for $1,088 (equivalent to $29,100 in 2021). His second store opened in Burley, Idaho, in 1918. By 1921, M.B. Skaggs owned multiple stores in Idaho and Montana.[6]\nM.B. Skaggs moved to Portland, Oregon in 1921, and he established four groceries in town that year, in part by buying a grocer and a coffee company. The chain, which operated as two separate businesses, Skaggs Cash Stores and Skaggs United Stores, grew quickly, and Skaggs enlisted the help of his five brothers to grow the network of stores. M.B.'s business strategy, to give his customers value and to expand by keeping a narrow profit margin, proved spectacularly successful. By 1926, he had opened 428 Skaggs stores in 10 states. M.B. almost doubled the size of his business that year when he merged his company with 322  Sam Seelig Company stores and incorporated as Safeway, Inc., because he thought that a chain that would outlive him should not carry his name.[7][8][9][10]\nThe point of the name was that the grocery operated on a cash-and-carry basis \u2013 it did not offer credit, as grocers traditionally had done. It was the \"safe way\" to buy food because a family could not get into debt via its grocery bill (as many families did at the time, a contributing cause of the Great Depression).\nIn 1926, Charles E. Merrill, the founder of the Merrill Lynch brokerage firm, saw an opportunity to consolidate the West Coast grocery industry. Towards this end, he purchased the 322-store Safeway chain of W.R.H. Weldon, who wished to exit retailing and concentrate on wholesale. Then, in June 1926, Merrill offered Skaggs either $7\u00a0million outright or $1.5\u00a0million plus 30,000 shares in the merged firm. Skaggs took the latter.[11] On July 1, 1926, Safeway merged with the 673 stores from Skaggs United Stores of Idaho and Skaggs Cash Stores of California. On completion of the Skaggs/Safeway merger, M.\u00a0B.\u00a0Skaggs became the Chief Executive of the business.[12] Two years later, Skaggs listed Safeway on the New York Stock Exchange. In the 1930s, Safeway introduced produce pricing by the pound, adding \"sell by\" dates on perishables, nutritional labeling, and some of the first parking lots.\nThe merger instantly created the largest chain of grocery stores west of the Mississippi.[13] In the 1930s, Charles E. Merrill temporarily left Merrill Lynch to help manage Safeway. At the time of the merger, the company was headquartered in Reno, Nevada. In 1929, it was relocated to a former grocery warehouse in Oakland, California. Safeway headquarters remained there until the move to Pleasanton, California in 1996.\nIn the late 1930s, the New Negro Alliance boycotted the Sanitary Grocery Company (then a Safeway subsidiary) to pressure store owners to employ black people, especially in predominantly black neighborhoods. The Sanitary Grocery Company successfully sought an injunction against the New Negro Alliance, which was upheld by the Washington, D.C. Court of Appeals. This led to the 1938 landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision of New Negro Alliance v. Sanitary Grocery Co., which defended the right to peaceful protest in the resolution of labor disputes.[14][15]\nIn 1969, the Black Panther Party and the United Farm Workers launched simultaneous boycotts of Safeway grocery stores, which were the largest grocery store chain in the U.S. West at that time.[16][17] The Panthers boycotted due to Safeway's refusal to donate to their Free Breakfast for Children Program, created to serve daily hot breakfasts to underprivileged children throughout the U.S.[16] The United Farm Workers boycotted Safeway because the chain continued to sell California grapes despite the union's nationwide boycott.[16] The Panthers and United Farm Workers also acted in solidarity with each other's goals in boycotting Safeway, including during a 1973 Panthers demonstration outside an Oakland Safeway store documented by KPIX Eyewitness news, in which protestors carried signs that read \"Boycott Safeway, Boycott Grapes.\"[18]\nThe initial public offering price of Safeway stock was $226 in 1927. A five for one split in 1928 brought the price down to under $50. Over the next few years, Charles Merrill, with financing supplied by Merrill Lynch, then began aggressively acquiring numerous regional grocery store chains for Safeway in a rollup strategy. Early acquisitions included significant parts of Piggly Wiggly chain as part of the breakup of that company by Merrill Lynch and Wall Street.\nMost transactions involved the swap of stock certificates, with little cash changing hands. Most acquired chains retained their own names until the mid-1930s.\nIn 1929, there were rumors of a Safeway-Kroger merger.[19][20]\nThe number of stores peaked at 3,400 in 1932, when expansion ground to a halt. The Great Depression had finally impacted the chain, which began to focus on cost control. In addition, numerous smaller grocery stores were being replaced with larger supermarket stores. By 1933, the chain ranked second in the grocery industry behind The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company and ahead of Kroger.\nIn 1935, Safeway sold its nine stores in Honolulu, Hawaii \"because of the inconvenience of proper supervision\".[21] Also in 1935, independent groceries in California convinced the California legislature to enact a progressive tax on chain stores. Before the act took effect, Safeway filed a petition to have the law put to a referendum. In 1936, the California electorate voted to repeal the law.\nIn 1936, Safeway introduced a money back guarantee on meat.[22]\nIn November 2016, Safeway Inc. agreed to buy Andronico's remaining stores, which were based primarily in the San Francisco Bay Area. When Andronico's closed as an independent company, it had a total of nine locations: three in Berkeley (Solano Avenue, Telegraph Avenue, and Shattuck Avenue); one in the Rancho Shopping Center in Los Altos; one on Irving Street San Francisco; one at the Stanford Shopping Center in Palo Alto;[23] one in Walnut Creek;[24] one in Danville;[25] and one in town of San Anselmo in Marin County. The stores began closing in January 2017, with the North Berkeley, California store closing first.[26] In February 2019, Safeway said that it was considering bringing back the Andronico's name. By February 2020, six Safeway stores were operating under the Andronico's Community Market label, with a seventh planned. Four Andronico\u2019s stores in the Bay Area were renamed Safeway Community Market after the 2016 acquisition, though the flagship store in the Sunset District kept the Andronico\u2019s name. Another store in Monterey opened in January 2019 as Andronico\u2019s.[27] In February 2020, four locations of Safeway Community Markets returned to the Andronico\u2019s name - two in Berkeley, one in Los Altos, and one in San Anselmo.[28]\nThe company expanded into Canada in 1929 with 127 stores (which became Canada Safeway Limited and which was sold to Sobeys in 2013);[30] into the United Kingdom in 1962 (which became Safeway plc); into Australia in 1963 (which became Safeway Australia); and into West Germany in 1964. The company also has operations in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in a licensing and management agreement with the Tamimi Group during the 1980s. In 1981, it acquired 49% of Mexican retailer Casa Ley.\nSafeway usually achieved international expansion by acquiring one or more small chains in a given country. It expanded into Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, however, through a joint venture. This initial nucleus of stores received Safeway systems and technology and then expanded organically. International chains acquired include:\nIn 1941, Marion B. Skaggs retired from the Safeway board of directors.[12]\nIn 1947, the company's sales exceeded $1 billion for the first time. By 1951, total sales had reached nearly $1.5 billion. The company adopted the S logo, which it still uses, in 1962.\nIn 1955, Robert A. Magowan became Chairman of the Board of Safeway. Magowan had married Charles Merrill's daughter, Doris. Magowan also assumed the title of President in 1956. He remained President until 1968, and a member of the board until 1978. In 1966, Robert A Magowan brought his star Meat Processing Plant Manager, Michael F. Concannon to Oakland to become the Head of Meat Processing in North America. He retired in 1978 as well. Mike was instrumental in opening the Stockton plant. The Wichita plant and Meat Processing in Canada began in the 1970s.\nIn 1959, Safeway opened its first store in the new state of Alaska\u2014the first major food retailer to enter that market. The company opened three stores in Anchorage and one in Fairbanks over the next several years. The store in downtown Fairbanks was built on the site of a red-light district, known as The Line, which operated for close to a half century. Most of these stores were in buildings constructed by Anchorage real estate developer Wally Hickel, who later became governor of Alaska and U.S. Secretary of the Interior.\nAlso in 1959, the firm also opened the first \"marina-style\" store on the Marina in San Francisco. Hundreds of stores in this barrel-vaulted-roof style opened during the next decade.[31]\nIn 1961, the company sold its New York operations to Finast.[32] In 1963, Safeway again opened stores in Hawaii, having exited this market in 1934.[33] It leased one store in Culver City to animator/filmmaker Don Bluth, who used it as a theater until 1967.\nIn 1969, Safeway entered the Toronto market in Canada and the Houston market in Texas through opening new stores, rather than by acquisition. The firm ultimately failed against entrenched competition in both these markets.\nIn 1977, Safeway management instituted a program to fight counterfeit $100 bills by, among other things, telling employees that bills that lacked the words \"In God We Trust\" were counterfeit. Because Safeway had not sufficiently investigated the history of $100 bills, it was unaware that some bills still in circulation did not have the phrase. Eventually, an innocent shopper was incorrectly reported to Oakland, California, police for passing a \"counterfeit\" bill. He was arrested and strip-searched before Oakland police contacted the Treasury Department and realized the error. The 1981 jury verdict of joint and several liability for $45,000 against Safeway Stores and the City of Oakland was upheld in full by the Supreme Court of California on December 26, 1986.[34]\nIn 1979, Peter Magowan, son of Robert Magowan and grandson of Charles Merrill, was appointed chairman and CEO of Safeway. Magowan managed Safeway for the next 13 years\u2014presiding over the dramatic decline of the firm in terms of store numbers\nFollowing a hostile takeover bid from corporate raiders Herbert and Robert Haft, the chain was acquired by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) acting as a white knight in 1986. With the assistance of KKR, the company was taken private and assumed tremendous debt. To pay off this debt, the company began selling off a large number of its operating divisions.\nThe divested domestic divisions of Safeway proved to be problematic for almost all those who acquired them. Essentially every purchasing entity hit financial troubles and either went bankrupt or was later acquired. (Hy-Vee and Fareway are the exceptions with the locations they acquired, having made them work.)\nThe international stores were more successful for their acquirers. Safeway plc, the operator of the UK stores, was sold to Argyll Foods, which itself was ultimately absorbed by Morrisons in 2004. Safeway Australia was sold to the Australian-based Woolworths Limited in 1985.\nSafeway sold its stores in Southern California, including those in established markets like Los Angeles and San Diego, to The Vons Companies in 1988 in exchange for a 30 percent interest in the company. Safeway also scaled back its operations in Fresno, Modesto, Stockton, and Sacramento. Save Mart Supermarkets purchased the few remaining Fresno Safeway stores in 1996.\nMany stores in the Eastern Division were also closed or sold in the 1987\u20131989 timeframe, including many recent additions in the DelMarVa Eastern Shore area.\nSafeway's national presence was now reduced to several western states and Northern California, plus the Washington, D.C. area. Altogether, nearly half the 2,200 stores in the chain were sold.\nThe company was taken public again in 1990, with the Jordan stores sold to the Masri family in 1991. In December 2003, the Masri family sold it to The Sultan Center of Kuwait. The late 1990s and early 2000s once again saw Safeway rapidly expand into new territories under a variety of regional names. In 1997, Safeway bought out the rest of The Vons Companies, giving it Southern California stores once more. In 1998, Chicago-based Dominick's Finer Foods was acquired from Yucaipa Companies. While Safeway had stores in Alaska, in 1999 they bought Carrs-Safeway, with the same year bringing the purchase of Houston-based Randall's Food Markets, which also had stores in Austin, Texas. Randalls also had stores in the Dallas-Fort Worth area through Randalls' other brand, Tom Thumb, along with gourmet grocery store Simon David. The purchase of Randalls also started the practice of Safeway-owned gas stations, as Randalls already had stations at their stores.[38]\nIn 2000, Safeway started grocery delivery operations[39] and in 2001 acquired the family-owned Genuardi's chain, with locations in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. While Safeway also created the subsidiary Blackhawk Network, a prepaid and payments network, a card-based financial solutions company, and a provider of third-party prepaid cards, around this time, Genuardi's would be the last grocery purchase Safeway would make.\nBy the early 2000s, Safeway's expansion beyond the West Coast had been poorly received, citing Safeway's brands and West Coast-based buyers, with Dominick's on the sale block, and Randalls and Genuardi's losing market share.[40]\nTo reinvigorate the flagging divisions, increase brand involvement, and to differentiate itself from its competitor, Safeway began a $100 million brand repositioning campaign labeled \"Ingredients for life\" in 2005.[41][42]\nThe launch included a redesigned logo, a new slogan \"Ingredients for life\" alongside a four-panel life icon to be used throughout stores and advertising, and a web application called \"FoodFlex\" to improve consumer nutrition. Many locations are being converted to the \"Lifestyle\" format. The new look was designed by Michigan-based PPC Design. In addition to the \"inviting decor with warm ambiance and subdued lighting\", the move required heavy redesign of store layout, new employee uniforms, sushi and olive bars, and the addition of in-store Starbucks kiosks (with cupholders on grocery carts). The change also involved differentiating the company from competitors with promotions based on the company's extensive loyalty card database. This would be the design going forward for new and remodeled stores.\nAt the end of 2004, there were 142 \"Lifestyle\" format stores in the United States and Canada, with plans to open or remodel another 300 stores with this type of theme the following year. \"Lifestyle\" format stores have seen significantly higher average weekly sales than its other stores. By the end of 2006, shares were up, proving this rebranding campaign had a major impact on sale figures.[42]\nIn July 2007, the company stock rose on speculation that Sears Holdings Corporation was seeking to purchase Safeway.[43]\nIn 2012, the company dissolved the Genuardi's chain in the Philadelphia metro through a combination of store selloffs and closures. Giant acquired 15 of the chain's stores and made an offer for a 16th which was instead sold to a local chain, McCaffrey's, as part of an antitrust settlement. Weis also bought three Genuardi's locations. A number of unprofitable Genuardi's units also had closed in 2010 and 2011 as their leases expired.\nThe Genuardi's stores in Wilmington, Delaware, were converted to the Safeway name in 2004 due to legal issues stemming from a union contract signed by the management of early Safeway stores in Delaware that closed in 1982. The current Safeway locations in Delaware are served by division offices in the Baltimore\u2013Washington metropolitan area, where Safeway has long been a major grocer.\nIn 2011, Safeway signed an agreement with UNFI, for the distribution to all of Safeway's banners in the United States for non-proprietary natural, organic and specialty products effective October 2011.[44]\nIn 2013, it was announced that Cerberus Capital Management were exploring a deal for all or part of Safeway.[45] On June 12, 2013, Sobeys announced it would acquire Safeway's operations in Canada for CAD$5.8 billion, subject to regulatory approval. The move will bolster its presence in Western Canada, where Safeway was predominant.[46] Sobeys completed the sale five months later while keeping the Safeway banner on its newly acquired stores while changing private labels to be more inline with those used by its new parent.[47]\nIn October 2013, Safeway announced that it would close and sell its remaining Dominick's stores in the Chicago area by early 2014.[48][49] The announcement spurred its competitors to seek employees and desirable store locations they could purchase.[50] One location would remain open in Bannockburn, Illinois until January 25, 2014.[51]\nOn February 19, 2014, Safeway began to explore selling itself. On March 6, 2014, longtime rival Albertsons, backed by Cerberus Capital Management announced it would purchase Safeway for $9.4 billion in a deal expected to close in the 4th quarter of the year.[52] Many of Safeway's private brands and IT systems were integrated and replaced Albertsons legacy equipment. As part of the purchase, Blackhawk Network was spun off into an independent company. Blackhawk remained Safeway's sole gift card provider until 2021, when Albertsons switched to InComm for branded gift cards and network activation. Blackhawk continued to provide Safeway with store gift cards and store credit until January 5th 2023, at which point the remaining Blackhawk cards were taken offline (though cards activated prior to this point will not expire until 2037).\nOn January 30, 2015, the merger between Safeway and Albertsons was finalized.[53] As part of the merger, Bellingham, Washington-headquartered grocery chain Haggen announced it would buy 146 Vons, Albertsons, and Pavilions stores across Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, and Arizona as part of anti-monopoly requirements following the merger. Some of the major metropolitan areas affected were Los Angeles, Portland, Phoenix, Tucson, San Diego, Bakersfield, Seattle, and Las Vegas.[54] Other stores in the West Coast, along with the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex market, also saw divestments.\nFollowing the purchase, Safeway and its remaining brands, Randalls, Tom Thumb, Vons, and Pavilions, along with their respective divisions, were integrated into the operations of Albertsons, and Safeway's proprietary food products were distributed in all of the Albertsons-Safeway banners, replacing Albertsons' SuperValu branded products. All former Albertsons banners had their telephones and NCR POS systems replaced with Safeway's Toshiba/IBM hardware.\nOn January 11, 2016, it was announced that the three remaining Albertsons stores in Florida, located in Largo, Altamonte Springs and Oakland Park, would be re-bannered as Safeway; this marks the first time that the Safeway brand would exist on a supermarket operation in Florida.[56] These stores were short lived, as Albertsons later abandoned their Florida operations and sold the stores to Publix in 2018.[57]\nBeginning in 2018, Safeway and Albertsons began remodeling stores with a new theme that moved away from the \"Lifestyle\" decor first introduced in the early 2000s. The new theme features brighter colors and tiled backsplashes on department signage. The company has also begun to replace most of its lighting setup in favor of LEDs. Most older stores used fluorescent tubes in the main aisles with halogen spotlights in the departments or to accent display cases for a relaxed ambiance. The new standard is LED retrofit tubes for the old fluorescent fixtures, and completely replacing the halogen spot lamps with LED strips or office-style ceiling fixtures that focus on overall illumination instead of targeted, accented lighting. They also replaced lighting in employee areas and offices throughout 2021.\nIn August 2021, Safeway launched FreshPass, a paid subscription service that allows for free unlimited delivery/pickup and gives members exclusive discounts and offers. The program was launched with a refreshed mobile app that supports scan-and-pay shopping in select markets. Safeway also activated QR payments and digital receipts with the updated mobile app. The \"Just for U\" rewards program (commonly branded J4U), first launched in 2012, was simplified to \"for u\" as part of the FreshPass launch.\nOther Albertsons stores in various markets have rebannered as Safeway, including Denver[58] and Seattle.[59]\n\"Signature Select\" is the company's signature private label that offers an everyday range of products. \"Signature Reserve\" is the company's private label for more upscale products. The label \"Primo Taglio\" is used for upscale deli products and \"Lucerne\" is the main dairy line for the company. In 2006, Safeway introduced an organically grown and processed line of products named \"O Organics\". A number of prepared dishes and soups are available under \"Signature Cafe\". After its acquisition by Albertsons, the combined company adopted Safeway's private label brand program, previously named \"Safeway Select\".\nSome of the brands in use are:\nSignature Select / Refreshe Brand Cola is produced by Cotts Beverages for Safeway; it is bottled in San Bernardino, California. Safeway Refreshe brand bottled water is bottled by Advanced H2O, LLC in Stockton, California. Safeway closed its water bottling plant in downtown Los Angeles in January 2012.\nSafeway has offered online grocery delivery service in select markets starting in the American Northwest region in 2000.[39] The service grew to deliver in six states and the District of Columbia, mostly along the west and east coast.[61] Fueled by rising demand from the COVID-19 pandemic, Safeway has been rapidly expanding the number of locations offering contactless curbside pickup (marketed as \"DriveUp & Go\"), and continues to offer traditional prescheduled delivery services along with on-demand deliveries filled via Instacart. In early 2020, Safeway began offering deli department items and prepared-to-order sandwiches on DoorDash, and eventually began offering grocery delivery as well once they introduced DoorDash Marketplace. Curbside pickup orders are processed by Store Employees with items off the shelf in a manner similar to Instacart.\nIn January 2021, Albertsons announced that it would be laying off union company-employed grocery delivery drivers at Safeway stores in the Northern California region, stating that they would be transferring those services to app-based delivery platforms, such as Instacart.[62] This decision only affected employees working in the 'traditional' scheduled delivery department inside the stores, and all employees were offered other positions within the company. This announcement came several weeks after Proposition 22 was passed in California, which allowed app-based services to classify their employees as independent contractors instead of full-time employees. The company has appeared to scale back this approach however, as deliveries are still handled by employees at some larger, high-volume locations in the area. At most neighborhood locations, delivery is now handled exclusively by DoorDash and Instacart.\nSafeway throughout the decades has ventured and experimented with different concepts and themes for its locations and stores.\nIn 1963, Safeway developed the Super S format\u2014which combined a general merchandise and drug store and a new Safeway supermarket in the same building. The stores shared a common entrance, but operated as separate businesses with their own checkstands. The first outlet opened in Anchorage, Alaska. In 1965, 22 existing Super S stores were sold to Skaggs Drug Stores. Safeway sold the remaining stores in 1971.[63] Some of these stores, such as #1526 outside the Valley Fair Mall in San Jose, were walled off and subdivided to allow chain drugstores to sign leases while the Safeway remained operating in its original configuration.\nIn 1964, Safeway opened a trial two-level International Store at 12th and F Street in Washington, D.C., with a conventional Safeway downstairs and a gourmet store on the upper floor. The Safeway International Store range included wild boar steaks, snow hare, suckling pig, and reindeer steaks.[64]\nThe company also made a number of attempts to repurpose older, smaller store sites, opening Food Barn, a discount grocery outlet, and Liquor Barn, a discount liquor outlet, in the 1970s. Safeway also trialed Town House in Washington, D.C., small stores targeting apartment dwellers, and a gourmet store concept, Bon Appetit in San Francisco and Tiburon, California.\nIn 1969, Safeway formed a joint venture with Holly Farms Poultry Industries (now part of Tyson Foods) to open Holly Farms Fried Chicken in an effort to diversify into fast food restaurants and compete with KFC. The first store opened in Colonial Heights, Virginia in August 1969.[65]\nSafeway also acquired Pak 'n Save Foods, a box warehouse concept, as part of the 1983 purchase of Brentwood in Northern California.[66] While these stores were initially distinct in price points and bulk sales, today they are functionally and operationally the same as regular Safeway supermarkets. As of 2023, only 2 remaining Pak 'n Save locations remain in San Leandro and Emeryville; all of the other remaining locations were either permanently closed or remodeled into standard Safeway locations.[67]\nSafeway Medallion logo, 1946\nThe Ribbon Leaf logo, 1982\nThe Medallion logo in tile, July 2005\nThe Safeway ATM Network, run for Safeway by Cardtronics, operates in Colorado, Oregon, Wyoming and Washington. Usually, one machine is located near the front of each store that has an ATM. Cirrus, Plus, Star, and NYCE are on the network. The network started late 1998 in Denver and expanded into Wyoming, Washington, and Oregon.\nSafeway transitioned[when?] from regional control of its product assortments to national category management, known as the Safeway Category Optimization Process (SCOP). With all dry grocery corporate buying done from Safeway's Pleasanton offices, it is said it will increase representation of manufacturers by experienced sales professionals with extensive product and category knowledge. Corporate produce buying offices are located in Phoenix, Arizona. This will mean consistency across the Safeway chain, meaning one could go into a store in Winnipeg or San Francisco and find the same products at the same price, as all negotiation is now done at the corporate level.\nIn 2012, Mercy for Animals conducted an undercover investigation at Christensen Farms, a pork supplier to Safeway, Walmart, Costco, Kroger, and Kmart.[68] Before the public release of Mercy for Animals' investigation at Christensen Farms, Safeway announced it would begin requiring pork suppliers to phase out gestation crates.[69][70]\nIn 2008, Greenpeace started ranking America's major supermarket chains on their seafood sustainability practices because, according to Phil Radford, Greenpeace U.S. CEO, \"three quarters of global fish stocks are suffering from overfishing,[71] and 90% of top marine predators are already gone\".[72][73] Criteria included the number of threatened fish species supermarkets sold, their seafood purchasing policies, and ocean legislation policies it supported.[74] Greenpeace annual Carting Away the Oceans (CATO) report ranks supermarkets on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being least sustainable with seafood policies and 10 being the most sustainable with seafood policies. Safeway ranked second best (7.1 out of 10) on the 2013 CATO Report by ensuring that its store brand of canned tuna was sustainably fished and by lobbying for science-based ocean conservation policies.[75]\nIn 2016, Safeway parent company Albertsons joined a growing wave of companies moving toward \"cage-free\" egg production and announced a planned shift to cage-free eggs by 2025 following campaigns by The Humane League, Mercy for Animals, The Humane Society of the United States, and others.[76]\nSafeway music is provided by InStore Broadcasting Network. Each store has a IBN streaming box that is connected to the intercom's amplifier. These boxes stream music online, and will not operate if the store does not have an internet connection. The satellite network also beams commercials and advertisements for Safeway products and services that play intermittently with the music. The store's unique \"Attention Service Desk\" announcements, which are used to communicate phone calls on hold to employees, are generated by Cisco's Call Manager Server as an overhead announcement.",

Family-owned until purchased by Safeway in 2000, Genuardi's had its headquarters in the Bentwood Executive Campus in East Norriton Township, Pennsylvania in Greater Philadelphia.[1][2][3]\nAfter many of its remaining stores were sold or closed, there was a Safeway-owned store under the former chain's name located in Audubon, Pennsylvania that remained open until May 2015.[4]\nIn 1920, Gaspare and Josephine Genuardi owned a farm near Norristown, Pennsylvania and grew fruits and vegetables. The couple went around to their neighbors delivering produce to them. Gaspare and Josephine were the parents of nine children. Of the nine were Charlie, Frank, Tom, Joe, and Jim who helped out with the business. The five sons soon became known as the \"Genuardi brothers\" by the customers.\nThe Genuardi family opened its first supermarket in Norristown in 1954, which until its closure was the oldest surviving Genuardi's in operation. Relatives of the Genuardi family also maintain a nursery and florist in Norristown.\nThe five Genuardi brothers expanded their supermarkets throughout the western Philadelphia suburbs, spanning Bucks, Delaware, Chester, and Montgomery counties. The company has never had any stores within Philadelphia city limits. In 1975, it acquired some former Pantry Pride (originally known as Food Fair) and A&P stores, and more ex-A&P properties rejected by Super Fresh in 1985.\nThe chain's first surviving stores outside Norristown opened in the 1980s. As the 1990s approached, the five brothers decided to transfer ownership of the stores to a third generation of family, which consisted of Jim Jr., Joe Jr., Charles A., Larry, Tom Jr., Michael, Anthony, Skip, and David Genuardi. Charles A. was named President/CEO of Genuardi's Family Markets. Also during this time, it owned a discount grocery chain called Mad Grocer. In the late 1990s, the company expanded into Delaware and New Jersey. The name of the supermarkets was generally pronounced as /d\u0292\u0259\u02c8n\u0251\u02d0rdis/ by the English speakers of the region, including in TV and radio commercials, regardless of any Italian pronunciation that the founding family's surname may originally have had in Italy; thus, /d\u0292\u0259n\u02c8w\u0251\u02d0rdis/, despite being reasonable with respect to an Italian original, was not the usual sound.\nIn February 2001, the Genuardi family sold the chain to Safeway. In the summer of 2004, all Genuardi's stores in Delaware were converted to the Safeway banner when they were unionized. Safeway already had stores of its own in southern Delaware. There were issues and local outrage over the Safeway takeover due to claims of price increases, the changeover of many products to Safeway's own brands, and the use of a loyalty card, which was not needed under Genuardi's previous ownership. Except for the Safeway conversions, Genuardi's remained non-union, despite heavy unionization in Safeway's other chains.\nIn 2005, grocery delivery was added to select Genuardi's stores. This allowed customers to order groceries via the Genuardi's/Safeway websites and have it delivered by truck in a set time frame. Later on in the year, Genuardi's closed two underperforming stores in East Windsor, New Jersey and Bensalem, Pennsylvania, the latter of which was converted to a ShopRite.\nDuring 2010, underperforming Genuardi's stores did not have their leases renewed and Safeway closed store locations in Newtown Square (Edgmont), Glen Mills, Chesterbrook, and Lansdale in Pennsylvania, and Voorhees in New Jersey.\nIn September 2011, Safeway was looking to sell all or part of Genuardi's.[5] Later that month, a sale of several of Genuardi's locations to Giant-Carlisle appeared to be imminent.[6]\nOn January 5, 2012, Giant announced its deal to acquire 15 Genuardi's Family Markets across the Philadelphia area in a $106 million deal.[7][8] For three weeks in July 2012, Giant opened 5 of the former Genuardi's stores each week.[7]\nWeis Markets announced on February 13, 2012, the purchase of three stores in Montgomery and Bucks counties.[9] The three Weis stores opened on June 16, 2012.[10]\nAlthough it was initially to be acquired by Giant, it was announced on June 6, 2012, that the Newtown store would instead become a McCaffrey's Food Markets.[11] The Newtown store became a McCaffrey's on July 15.[12]\nAfter failing to find a buyer for the location, the Cherry Hill store closed on August 4, 2012, and later became Whole Foods Market.[13]\nThe Barnegat and Egg Harbor Township/Northfield stores closed on December 12, 2012, the Barnegat store was to re-open as Safeway's sister chain Acme in 2016 and the Egg Harbor Township/Northfield store became JR's Fresh Market in 2015 but that closed in 2018 and became Lidl in 2021.[14][15]\nThe Marlton store closed on February 12, 2013.[16][17][7][18]\nThe Audubon store, the last remaining store, closed on May 27, 2015.\nAcme Markets, the chain's long-time rival, announced in late 2015 it would reopen the closed Barnegat location as an Acme; this was made possible when Albertsons (Acme's parent firm) merged with Safeway earlier in the year, and Safeway continued to hold the location's lease long after it closed. The store reopened as an Acme on February 5, 2016.", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genuardi%27s", " https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amazon_(company)#bodyContent",

{"text": "In accounting, revenue is the total amount of income generated by the sale of goods and services related to the primary operations of the business.[1]\nCommercial revenue may also be referred to as sales or as turnover. Some companies receive revenue from interest, royalties, or other fees.[2] \"Revenue\" may refer to income in general, or it may refer to the amount, in a monetary unit, earned during a period of time, as in \"Last year, Company X had revenue of $42 million\". Profits or net income generally imply total revenue minus total expenses in a given period. In accounting, revenue is a subsection of the Equity section of the balance statement, since it increases equity. It is often referred to as the \"top line\" due to its position at the very top of the income statement. This is to be contrasted with the \"bottom line\" which denotes net income (gross revenues minus total expenses).[3]\nIn general usage, revenue is the total amount of income by the sale of goods or services related to the company's operations. Sales revenue is income received from selling goods or services over a period of time. Tax revenue is income that a government receives from taxpayers. Fundraising revenue is income received by a charity from donors etc. to further its social purposes.\nIn more formal usage, revenue is a calculation or estimation of periodic income based on a particular standard accounting practice or the rules established by a government or government agency. Two common accounting methods, cash basis accounting and accrual basis accounting, do not use the same process for measuring revenue. Corporations that offer shares for sale to the public are usually required by law to report revenue based on generally accepted accounting principles or on International Financial Reporting Standards.\nIn a double-entry bookkeeping system, revenue accounts are general ledger accounts that are summarized periodically under the heading \"Revenue\" or \"Revenues\" on an income statement. Revenue account-names describe the type of revenue, such as \"repair service revenue\", \"rent revenue earned\" or \"sales\".[4]\nFor non-profit organizations, revenue may be referred to as gross receipts, support, contributions, etc.[5] This operating revenue can include donations from individuals and corporations, support from government agencies, income from activities related to the organization's mission, income from fundraising activities, and membership dues. Revenue (income and gains) from investments may be categorized as \"operating\" or \"non-operating\"\u2014but for many non-profits must (simultaneously) be categorized by fund (along with other accounts).\nFor non-profits with substantial revenue from the dues of their voluntary members: non-dues revenue is revenue generated through means besides association membership fees. This revenue can be found through means of sponsorships, donations or outsourcing the association's digital media outlets.\nBusiness revenue is money income from activities that are ordinary for a particular corporation, company, partnership, or sole-proprietorship. For some businesses, such as manufacturing or grocery, most revenue is from the sale of goods. Service businesses such as law firms and barber shops receive most of their revenue from rendering services. Lending businesses such as car rentals and banks receive most of their revenue from fees and interest generated by lending assets to other organizations or individuals.\nRevenues from a business's primary activities are reported as sales, sales revenue or net sales.[2] This includes product returns and discounts for early payment of invoices. Most businesses also have revenue that is incidental to the business's primary activities, such as interest earned on deposits in a demand account. This is included in revenue but not included in net sales.[6] Sales revenue does not include sales tax collected by the business.\nOther revenue (a.k.a. non-operating revenue) is revenue from peripheral (non-core) operations. For example, a company that manufactures and sells automobiles would record the revenue from the sale of an automobile as \"regular\" revenue. If that same company also rented a portion of one of its buildings, it would record that revenue as \u201cother revenue\u201d and disclose it separately on its income statement to show that it is from something other than its core operations. The combination of all the revenue-generating systems of a business is called its revenue model.[7]\nWhile the current IFRS conceptual framework[8] no longer draws a distinction between revenue and gains, it continues to be drawn at the standard and reporting levels.  For example, IFRS 9.5.7.1 states: \"A gain or loss on a financial asset or financial liability that is measured at fair value shall be recognised in profit or loss ...\" while the IASB defined IFRS XBRL taxonomy[9] includes OtherGainsLosses, GainsLossesOnNetMonetaryPosition and similar items.\nRevenue is a crucial part of financial statement analysis. The company's performance is measured to the extent to which its asset inflows (revenues) compare with its asset outflows (expenses). Net income is the result of this equation, but revenue typically enjoys equal attention during a standard earnings call. If a company displays solid \u201ctop-line growth\u201d, analysts could view the period's performance as positive even if earnings growth, or \u201cbottom-line growth\u201d is stagnant. Conversely, high net income growth would be tainted if a company failed to produce significant revenue growth. Consistent revenue growth, if accompanied by net income growth, contributes to the value of an enterprise and therefore the share price.\nRevenue is used as an indication of earnings quality. There are several financial ratios attached to it:\nGovernment revenue includes all amounts of money (i.e., taxes and fees) received from sources outside the government entity. Large governments usually have an agency or department responsible for collecting government revenue from companies and individuals.[10]\nGovernment revenue may also include reserve bank currency which is printed. This is recorded as an advance to the retail bank together with a corresponding currency in circulation expense entry, that is, the income derived from the Official Cash rate payable by the retail banks for instruments such as 90-day bills. There is a question as to whether using generic business-based accounting standards can give a fair and accurate picture of government accounts, in that with a monetary policy statement to the reserve bank directing a positive inflation rate, the expense provision for the return of currency to the reserve bank is largely symbolic, such that to totally cancel the currency in circulation provision, all currency would have to be returned to the reserve bank and canceled.", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", " https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amazon_(company)#bodyContent",

Wikipedia": {"text": "Lucid Group, Inc. is an American electric vehicle manufacturer headquartered in Newark, California.[4] The company was founded in 2007.[5] Deliveries of the Dream Edition launch versions were made available to the first group of 520 reservation holders on October 30, 2021.[6][7]\nLucid was founded in 2007 under the name Atieva and originally focused on building electric vehicle batteries and powertrains for other vehicle manufacturers.[8]\nLucid's CEO and CTO, Peter Rawlinson, formerly served as VP of Engineering and Chief Engineer of the Model S at Tesla, Inc.,[4] and Vice President Derek Jenkins previously worked as Head of Design at Mazda North American Operations.[9] The company has seen investments from Tsing Capital, Mitsui, Venrock, JAFCO, and others.[9][10]\nThe company rebranded to Lucid Motors in October 2016 and officially announced its intent to develop an all-electric, high-performance luxury vehicle.[8]\nOn November 29, 2016, state and company officials announced the planned construction of Lucid's US$700 million manufacturing plant in Casa Grande, Arizona, which was projected to employ up to 2,000 workers by the mid-2020s,[11][12][13] initially building 20,000 cars and expanding up to 130,000 cars per year. The factory was then to be designed to support a maximum capacity of 380,000 cars per year.[14] As of November\u00a02016[update], the company had planned to break ground in 2017, and have cars in production by early 2019.[15] The first vehicles began rolling off the assembly line on September 28, 2021.[16]\nOn September 17, 2018, Lucid Motors announced that they were in talks with the Public Investment Fund, which is the Saudi Arabian sovereign investment fund, for funding valued at over US$1 billion.[17][18] The investment was completed in April 2019.[19] The investment will fund: the final engineering and testing of the Lucid Air model; the first-phase construction of its manufacturing plant in Casa Grande, Arizona;[18] the commercial production of the Lucid Air; and Lucid's worldwide retail strategy, beginning in North America.[17][18][20] Construction of the plant began in late 2019, the first-phase was completed in December 2020.[21][22] The second-phase construction is ongoing and will increase production capacity from 34,000 to 90,000 vehicles a year. The completed factory (4 phases) will have a combined manufacturing capacity of about 400,000 cars per year.[23]\nIn February 2021, Lucid Motors announced a deal valued at US$11.75 billion to merge with Churchill Capital Corp IV, a publicly traded special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC).[24] CEO Rawlinson announced Lucid's intention to produce its Project Gravity SUV by 2023, then offer a competitor to Tesla's Model 3 by 2024 or 2025.[25][26]\nIn July 2021, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Public Investment Fund will own over 60 percent of Lucid when the company goes public.[27] The fund will record a profit of nearly US$20 billion from its investment in Lucid in 2018.[27]\nLucid began building its first all-electric Air sedans in Arizona in September 2021 and started delivering them to customers in late October.[28]\nLucid produced 7,180 vehicles in 2022[29] after decreasing its 2022 production outlook from 20,000 vehicles to 12,000\u201314,000 vehicles on \nFebruary 28, 2022, citing supply chain issues,[30][31] and again to 6,000\u20137,000 vehicles when it released its Q2 financial results on August 3, 2022[32][33]\nLucid mainly developed battery technology in its early years, but began development of its first car in 2014.[10]\nThe company initially used a Mercedes Metris van named \"Edna\", to develop the powertrain.[10][34]\nA prototype of the Lucid Air fully electric car was unveiled in December 2016. Lucid Air production was expected to start in spring 2021.[35] In November 2020, The Lucid Air Pure was announced with 406\u00a0mi (653\u00a0km) of projected range and 480\u00a0hp (360\u00a0kW) and a starting price of US$77,400. The full range of models includes Lucid Air Touring, Grand Touring, and Dream Edition versions. The top spec cars have an output of over 1,000\u00a0hp (750\u00a0kW).[36]\nOn September 16, 2020, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rated the range of the Lucid Air to be 520\u00a0mi (840\u00a0km) on a single charge.[37][38]\nLucid has agreed with Mobileye to use their EyeQ4 chips and eight cameras for driver assist features,[39] and will make the car \"autonomous ready\".[40] This 4-door sedan is able to reach a software-limited top speed of 217\u00a0mph (349\u00a0km/h).[41] In July 2017, running on the high-speed track at the Transportation Research Center in Ohio, a special version of the car (with the speed limiter disabled via software and other modifications) hit 235\u00a0mph (378\u00a0km/h).[41]\nLucid is collaborating with Amazon to build in compatibility with Amazon's Alexa voice assistant, allowing drivers to use the voice assistant for navigation, phone calls, media streaming, smart home control, and other activities while driving.[42]\nThe infotainment system is based on Android Automotive.[43]\nA Lucid Air is used by the character of Samantha Margolis in several episodes of season four of the Amazon Studios TV series Goliath.[44]\nIn September 2021, Lucid released the EPA estimated range for both the Dream Edition Air and Air Grand Touring; the Dream Air had a range of 520 miles on a single charge while the Grand Touring offered 516 miles, making the Dream the longest range of any EV rated by the EPA and the Grand Touring the first to top 400 miles in a test drive.[45][46]\nLucid Motors unveiled its 2022 Lucid Air Grand Touring model in November 2021. This version of the Air Grand Touring is powered by two electric motors that combine for 819\u00a0hp (611\u00a0kW) and 885\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (1,200\u00a0N\u22c5m) of torque.[46][47]\nOn May 5, 2022, Lucid announced that it was raising prices of the variants of its luxury Air sedan, beginning June 1, 2022. The price hikes were expected to push the base price of the Air sedan up as much as 13%.[48]\nLucid Air was named Motor Trend\u2019s 2022 Car of the Year, being the first time a brand new car model won the award.[49]\nLucid teased an electric SUV concept in September 2020 called Project Gravity with only a brief image and short video segment.[35]:\u200a43:38\u201344:25\u200a Additional details were found in the patents that Lucid filed for the Gravity. The patents show that the Gravity features sleek headlamps similar to those of the Lucid Air as well as a visibly short hood and a large windscreen. In addition, the patents show that the side of the vehicle has a horizontal beltline as well as a sleek, wide windows, and quarter glass panels.[50]\nThe Lucid Air will debut with a 900V+ electrical architecture, and custom lithium-ion battery cells.[51] Lucid's car uses the 2170[9] standard for its lithium-ion battery cells,[52] and supply agreements have been signed with both Samsung SDI[53] and LG Chem.[54]\nLucid designs, develops, manufactures, and supplies battery packs for gen2 Formula E race teams beginning in the 2018-2019 season[55] through the 2021-2022 racing season,[4][56] in collaboration with McLaren Applied Technologies and Sony.[57][58] The Formula E specification[59] calls for a battery weight of 250\u00a0kg (550\u00a0lb), 54 kWh energy, and peak power of up to 250\u00a0kW.[60]\nLucid Motors partnered with Electrify America to use their nationwide charging network as an option for recharging Lucid's electric vehicles on the road.[61][62] The Lucid Air will be able to add 300 miles (480\u00a0km) in 20 minutes when using the station's 350\u00a0kW charging capability.[63]\nIn December 2019, Lucid broke ground on a factory in Casa Grande, Arizona, the first greenfield facility for EV manufacturing in the United States.[64] On December 1, 2020, Lucid completed factory construction, dubbed AMP-1, and \"aims to ramp up to 400,000 electric cars per year.\"[65]\nThe US$700 million facility was expected to begin producing the Lucid Air by spring 2021. The initial phase includes an initial 999,000 square feet (92,800\u00a0m2). Phase 2 of construction was expected to begin in early 2021. The land upon which this facility is built is owned by Pinal County, Arizona, who leases the 500-acre (200\u00a0ha) plot to Lucid. The land was bought by Pinal County for $29.94 million, which was financed by issuing bonds.[66]\nOn February 28, 2022, Lucid announced a long-term plan to build a new manufacturing plant in Saudi Arabia with the capability of producing 150,000 vehicles per year. Lucid has partnered with the Ministry of Investment of Saudi Arabia (MISA), The Saudi Industrial Development Fund (SIDF), and the King Abdullah Economic City (KAEC).[67]\nOn, 27 April 2022, Government of Saudi Arabia announced to purchase a minimum of 50,000 electric vehicles and up to 100,000 electric vehicles from Lucid Motors over a ten-year period.[68] The Saudi government said the decision was in line with efforts to make its fleet more environmentally friendly and diversify the national economy away from oil. Lucid was selected, the government said, because the company is setting up a full production factory in Saudi Arabia\u2014its first international manufacturing plant, which is aiming to produce 150,000 cars annually.[69]", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_Motors", " https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amazon_(company)#bodyContent", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page",

2016, it has been operating primarily to support previously sold models through parts and service manual distribution. While ATK was initially founded on in-house chassis designs and modified sourced engines, the brand has primarily focused on acquisition and badge-engineered models from multiple companies worldwide since 2004.\nATK was founded by Horst Leitner, an Austrian-born engineer, Grand Prix motocross racer, and International Six Days Trial gold medallist, following his relocation to the United States in 1980. In 1985, after successfully patenting a new motorcycle drive-tensioning system and marketing custom-frame kit bikes designed to accept Honda XR350 engines, Leitner was approached by Puch, who offered to fund a motorcycle company based on his designs. Leitner named the new venture ATK after his patented device to eliminate chain torque for improved handling. Known later as the A-Trak, Leitner originally called this device the Anti-Tension Kettenantrieb (German: Anti-Tension Chain Drive).[4] His first prototype machine would produce the following placements:[5]\nBy 1987, due to the high regard for ATK's chassis, which already utilized a Rotax engine, Can-Am approached ATK about creating a replacement for their off-road line using dated 250 cc and 400 cc two-stroke Rotax engines. From this foundation, ATK created the 250 and 406 models. These motorcycles retained many of ATK's unique chassis features, including a countershaft-mounted rear disc brake, side-mounted single rear shock with no linkage, offset fuel tank filler, air filter beneath the gas tank, and backward-facing brake pedal.\nAs the prototypes were delivered, Can-Am cancelled the deal and announced their withdrawal from the off-road motorcycle market. This led to an agreement between Leitner and North American Can-Am dealers to fund the production of the 406 and future motorcycles. ATK gained a nationwide dealer network and funding, and Can-Am dealers retained a product to sell. From 1989 until 1995, ATK was the fifth largest off-road motorcycle manufacturer in North America.[6] An article by Motocross Action magazine in December 2019 states that ATK produced thousands of four-stroke motorcycles since 1985, predating Japanese manufacturers' move to four-stroke engines by over a decade.[7]\nATK initially released the 560, based on the displacement of its 562\u00a0cc (34.3\u00a0cu\u00a0in) Rotax four-stroke engine. Modifications to the frame would see the designation change to the 604, which was used until the motorcycle received an engine revision in 1994. In 1988, ATK released the 406, the two-stroke air-cooled Rotax-powered model that would become synonymous with their two-stroke line. The two-stroke line was also the first to receive a second bike, a 250\u00a0cc (15\u00a0cu\u00a0in) counterpart.\nIn 1991, Leitner sold ATK to an investment company,[8] who would move the corporation to Utah. The new owners would expand the product line-up greatly, offering a second four-stroke, the 350, as well as electric-start and lightened variations of most models. The company also released ATK's first ATV, based on the 604, and XR kits, a full set of ATK accoutrements that accepted a Honda XR350 engine.[clarification needed]\n1994 would see the 604 revised into the 605, as well as the introduction of the 600 Flat Track model. 1996 brought the liquid-cooled 250 and 260 lines, as well as a Limited Edition 406 send-off model as ATK retired their open-class two-stroke offering. 1999 would see the introduction of the 50MX, an introductory motocross/pit bike model sold for two years. In 2003, with the purchase of Cannondale Motorsports, ATK began to assimilate the acquired models into their line-up. Thus began a new era for the company, as it began to badge-engineer its products.\nThe acquisition of Cannondale Motorsports by ATK was the result of a failed $80-million dollar+ investment between Cannondale Bicycle Corporation and private equity firms[10] in the late 1990s to create a subsidiary producing off-road motorcycles and ATV vehicles. First announced at the 1998 Cincinnati Motorcycle Dealer Show (at which Cannondale began accepting dealer orders), their X400 Motocross bike would not appear on showroom floors until 2001.[11] The delays in delivery were the result of several engineering issues related to the many advancements Cannondale attempted to incorporate into the motorcycle, including two engine redesigns.[12] The potential of the new machine was found so impressive by Dirt Bike Magazine, they named it Bike of the Year,[13] two years ahead of its release. In February 1999, Dirt Bike editor Ron Lawson was quoted regarding the unreleased bike's possible appeal to \"older moto guys who want kind of a status symbol\" as opposed to novice motorcyclists.[14]\nApproaching release, several publications were provided with test machines. Many noted unreliability but focused on the advanced features, such as a reversed-placement engine, aluminum frame, electric start, unique air intake, and electronic fuel injection. Only one publication gave the machine a scathing review,[15] a foreshadowing of public reception. Once the machine was released, word of mouth and consistent recalls tanked sales. Confidence wavered, and outside investors called against Cannondale. While Cannondale attempted to correct various issues with the 2002 X440 model, it was \"too little, too late\",[16] as one publication noted in 2013. In January 2003, Cannondale Motorsports filed bankruptcy and ATK Motorcycles acquired all remaining inventory.[16][17]\nWhile the initial Cannondale motorcycle was considered a failure (and often appears on lists of the worst off-road motorcycles ever produced[18]), the Cannondale FX400 ATV was more positively received due to its chassis.[19] As ATK took over sales and production of Cannondale products, the ATV required marginal attention and was re-released to the market. ATK turned their focus to the X440, continuing to improve on the 2002 model. Resolving fuel delivery issues, suspension geometry, and reliability, the machine was placed back on the market. After another brief hiatus, additional refinement and a slight displacement increase, it was rebranded as the ATK 450 and offered in various trims. These models, including the street-legal factory SuperMoto set-up, sold modestly through 2008.\nFor 2003, ATK continued to offer variations of the 50MX, as well as a two-stroke 125, the 250 and 260 Enduros, the four-stroke 605 and 500 Enduro, and a 600 Police Edition. The biggest news, however, was the release of the ATK 700, marketed as the Intimidator.[20] This rebadged 78\u00a0hp (58\u00a0kW) motocross bike with a 700\u00a0cc (43\u00a0cu\u00a0in) two-stroke engine was available in limited quantities.[21] Along with its Maico counterpart, it ranks among the fastest off-road motorcycles ever released.[22][23] The ATK/Maico bike was offered intermittently until 2008,[24] and solidified the reputation of badge engineering, partly earned by its acquisition of Cannondale.\nATK would continue to sell their 450 MX bikes and ATVs in various trim through 2008. While always marketed under the ATK banner, ATVs continued to use Cannondale graphics, and at times used the \"ATK C-Dales\" moniker for marketing.\nIn November 2009, it was announced that ATK and Hyosung would be collaborating on a line of small motorcycles to be distributed through select Harley-Davidson dealerships.[26] While Harley-Davidson did not endorse the distribution, they did not actively prevent it until later, as Hyosung bikes were pulled from most dealerships prior to the introduction of Harley's competing small motorcycles in 2015.\nIn May 2011, ATK began delivering the first of three Hyosung models with ATK nameplates and a few requested changes. The market would see the distribution of the GV250, GV650 and ST7 models, each featuring the respective 250\u00a0cc (15\u00a0cu\u00a0in), 650\u00a0cc (40\u00a0cu\u00a0in), and 700\u00a0cc (43\u00a0cu\u00a0in) V-twin engines, until S&T sold ownership of Hyosung to Kolao Holdings in 2014.\nIn 1989, ATK approved a national print advertisement campaign depicting four men of Asian descent observing an ATK motorcycle, with the tag line \"To us, the Japanese all look alike\". While text within the ad clarifies this is in reference to the similarities of Japanese motocross machines against the unique features of ATK's offerings, the ad has appeared in commentaries regarding racism in advertising.[27][28][29]\nIn November 2000, Motocross Action (MXA) published a negative review of the 2001 Cannondale X400 motorcycle. While staff writers acknowledged its potential, criticisms such as soft shocks, a \"weird\" setup, consistent starter failure, the power band, maintenance, and safety issues (including the bike's movement without throttle input)[30] were more candid than most publications of the day. This led Cannondale officers to report back to investors that this review was the reason sales of the X400 were below expectation. In 2018, test rider Jody Weisel responded to the controversy in an article titled \"The Worst Bikes I've ever Raced\";[31]\nWhen people accuse me of being unfair to a bike in an MXA test, claiming that I am the reason that the bike failed in the public arena, I always say the same thing: \u201cI don\u2019t make \u2019em, I just break \u2019em.\u201d Which leads me to my 2001 Cannondale MX400 experience. I knew this bike was a roach before it was even made.", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATK_motorcycles", " https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amazon_(company)#bodyContent",
