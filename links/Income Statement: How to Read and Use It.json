{"Income Statement: How to Read and Use It": {"text": "What you need to know about this essential financial statement\nJames Chen, CMT is an expert trader, investment adviser, and global market strategist.\nAmanda Bellucco-Chatham is an editor, writer, and fact-checker with years of experience researching personal finance topics. Specialties include general financial planning, career development, lending, retirement, tax preparation, and credit.\nMira Norian / Investopedia\nAn income statement is one of the three important financial statements used for reporting a company\u2019s\u00a0financial performance\u00a0over a specific accounting period. The other two key statements are the balance sheet\u00a0and the cash flow statement.\nThe income statement focuses on the revenue,\u00a0expenses, gains, and losses of a company during a particular period. Also known as the profit and loss (P&L) statement or the statement of revenue and expense, an income statement provides valuable insights into a company\u2019s operations, the efficiency of its management, underperforming sectors, and its performance relative to industry peers.\nThe income statement is an integral part of the company performance reports that must be submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While a balance sheet provides the snapshot of a company\u2019s financials as of a particular date, the income statement reports income through a specific period, usually a quarter or a year, and its heading\u00a0indicates the duration, which may read as \u201cFor the (fiscal) year/quarter ended June 30, 2021.\u201d\nTheresa Chiechi \u00a9 Investopedia 2022\nThe income statement focuses on four key items: revenue,\u00a0expenses, gains, and losses. It does not differentiate between cash and non-cash\u00a0receipts\u00a0(sales in cash vs. sales on credit) or cash vs. non-cash payments/disbursements (purchases in cash vs. purchases on credit). It starts with the details of sales and then works down to compute\u00a0net income\u00a0and eventually earnings per share (EPS). Essentially, it gives an account of how the net revenue\u00a0realized by the company gets transformed into net earnings (profit or loss).\nThe following are covered in the income statement, though its format may vary, depending upon the local regulatory requirements, the diversified scope of the business, and the associated operating activities:\nRevenue realized through primary activities is often referred to as operating revenue. For a company manufacturing a product, or for a wholesaler, distributor, or retailer involved in the business of selling that product, the revenue from primary activities refers to revenue achieved from the sale of the product. Similarly, for a company (or its franchisees) in the business of offering services, revenue from primary activities refers to the revenue or fees earned in exchange for offering those services.\nRevenue realized through secondary, noncore business\u00a0activities is often referred to as nonoperating, recurring revenue. This revenue is sourced from the earnings that are outside the purchase and sale of goods and services and may include income from interest earned on business capital parked in the bank, rental income from business property, income from strategic partnerships like royalty payment receipts, or income from an advertisement display placed on business property.\nAlso called other income, gains indicate the net money made from other activities, like the sale of long-term assets. These include the net income realized from one-time nonbusiness activities, such as a company selling its old transportation van, unused land,\u00a0or a subsidiary company.\nRevenue should not be confused with receipts. Payment is usually accounted for in the period when sales are made or services are delivered. Receipts are the cash received and are accounted for when the money is received.\nA customer may take goods/services from a company on Sept. 28, which will lead to the revenue accounted for in September. The customer may be given a 30-day payment window due to his excellent credit and reputation, allowing until Oct. 28 to make the payment, which is when the receipts are accounted for.\nA business's cost to continue operating and turning a profit is known as an expense. Some of these expenses may be written off on a tax return if they meet Internal Revenue Service (IRS) guidelines.\nThese are all expenses incurred for earning the average operating revenue linked to the primary activity of the business. They include the cost of goods sold (COGS); selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses; depreciation or amortization; and research and development (R&D) expenses. Typical items that make up the list are employee wages, sales commissions, and expenses for utilities such as electricity and transportation.\nThese are all expenses linked to noncore business activities, like interest paid on loan money.\nThese are all expenses that go toward a loss-making sale of long-term assets, one-time or any other unusual costs, or expenses toward lawsuits.\nWhile primary revenue and expenses offer insights into how well the company\u2019s core business is performing, the secondary revenue and fees account for the company\u2019s involvement and expertise in managing ad hoc, non-core activities. Compared with the income from the sale of manufactured goods, a\u00a0substantially high-interest income from money lying in the bank indicates that the business may not be using the available cash to its full potential by expanding the production capacity, or that it is facing challenges in increasing its market share amid competition.\nRecurring rental income gained by hosting billboards at the company factory along a highway indicates that management is capitalizing upon the available resources and assets for additional profitability.\nMathematically, net income is calculated based on the following:\nTo understand the above formula with some real numbers, let\u2019s assume that a fictitious sports merchandise business, which additionally provides training, is reporting its income statement for a recent hypothetical quarter.\nImage by Sabrina Jiang \u00a9 Investopedia\u00a02022\nIt received $25,800 from the sale of sports goods and $5,000 from training services. It spent various amounts listed for the given activities that total of $10,650. It realized net gains of $2,000 from the sale of an old van, and it incurred losses worth $800 for settling a dispute raised by a consumer. The net income comes to $21,350 for the given quarter. The above example is the simplest form of income statement that any standard business can generate. It is called the single-step income statement as it is based on a simple calculation that sums up revenue and gains and subtracts expenses and losses.\nHowever, real-world companies often operate on a global scale, have diversified business segments offering a mix of products and services, and frequently get involved in mergers, acquisitions, and strategic partnerships. Such a wide array of operations, diversified set of expenses, various business activities, and the need for reporting in a standard format per regulatory compliance leads to multiple and complex accounting entries in the income statement.\nListed companies follow the multiple-step income statement, which segregates the operating revenue,\u00a0operating expenses, and gains from the nonoperating revenue, nonoperating expenses, and losses, and offers many more details through the income statement produced this way.\nEssentially, the different\u00a0measures of profitability in a multiple-step income statement are reported at four different levels in a business's operations: gross, operating, pretax, and after-tax. As we\u2019ll see shortly in the following example, this segregation helps in identifying how the income and profitability are moving/changing from one level to the other. For instance, high gross profit but lower operating income indicates higher expenses, while higher pretax profit and lower post-tax profit indicate loss of earnings to taxes and other one-time, unusual expenses.\nLet\u2019s look at an example based on the 2021 annual income statements of two large, publicly listed, multinational companies from different sectors: technology (Microsoft) and retail (Walmart).\nThe focus in this standard format is to calculate the profit/income at each subhead of revenue and operating expenses and then account for mandatory taxes, interest, and other nonrecurring, one-time events to arrive at the net income that applies to common stock. Though calculations involve simple additions and subtractions, the order in which the various entries appear in the statement and their relationships often get repetitive and complicated. Let\u2019s take a deep dive into these numbers for a better understanding.\nThe first section, titled Revenue, indicates that Microsoft\u2019s gross (annual) profit, or gross margin, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2021, was $115.86 billion. It was arrived at by deducting the cost of revenue ($52.23 billion) from the total revenue ($168.09 billion) realized by the technology giant during this fiscal year. Just over 30% of Microsoft\u2019s total sales went toward costs for revenue generation, while a similar figure for Walmart in its fiscal year 2021 was about 75% ($429 billion/$572.75 billion). It indicates that Walmart incurred much higher cost than Microsoft to generate equivalent sales.\nThe next section, called Operating Expenses, again takes into account Microsoft\u2019s cost of revenue ($52.23 billion) and total revenue ($168.09 billion) for the fiscal year to arrive at the reported figures. As Microsoft spent $20.72 billion on R&D and $25.23 billion on SG&A expenses, total operating expenses\u00a0are computed by summing all these figures ($52.23 billion + $20.72 billion + $25.23 billion = $98.18 billion).\nReducing total operating expenses from total revenue leads to operating income (or loss)\u00a0of $69.92 billion ($168.09 billion - $98.18 billion). This figure represents the earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) for its core business activities and is again used later to derive the net income.\nA comparison of the line items indicates that Walmart did not spend anything on R&D and had higher SG&A and total operating expenses than Microsoft.\nThe next section, titled Income from Continuing Operations, adds net other income or expenses (like one-time earnings), interest-linked expenses, and applicable taxes to arrive at the net income from continuing operations\u00a0($61.27 billion) for Microsoft, which is nearly 60% higher than that of Walmart ($13.67 billion).\nAfter discounting for any nonrecurring events, it\u2019s possible to arrive at the value of net income applicable to common shares. Microsoft had a much higher net income of $61.27 billion compared with Walmart\u2019s $13.67 billion.\nEarnings per share are computed by dividing\u00a0the net income figure by the number of weighted average shares outstanding. With 7.55 billion outstanding shares for Microsoft, its 2021 EPS came to $8.12 per share ($61.27 billion \u00f7 7.55 billion). With Walmart having 2.79 billion outstanding shares that fiscal year, its EPS came to $4.90 per share ($13.67 billion \u00f7 2.79 billion).\nMicrosoft had a lower cost for generating equivalent revenue, higher net income from continuing operations, and higher net income applicable to common shares compared with Walmart.\nThough the primary purpose of an income statement is to convey details of profitability and business activities of the company to the stakeholders, it also provides detailed insights into the company\u2019s internal activities for comparison across different businesses and sectors. By understanding the income and expense components of the statement, an investor can appreciate what makes a company profitable.\nBased on income statements, management can make decisions like expanding to new geographies, pushing sales, expanding production capacity, increasing the use of or the outright sale of assets, or shutting down a department or product line. Competitors also may use them to gain insights about the\u00a0success parameters of a company and focus areas such as lifting R&D spending.\nCreditors may find income statements\u00a0of limited use, as they are more concerned about a company\u2019s future cash flows than its past profitability.\u00a0Research analysts use the income statement to compare year-on-year\u00a0and quarter-on-quarter\u00a0performance. One can infer, for example, whether a company\u2019s efforts at reducing the cost of sales helped it improve profits over time, or whether management kept tabs on operating expenses without compromising on profitability.\n(1) Revenue,\u00a0(2) expenses, (3) gains, and (4) losses. An income statement is not a balance sheet or a cash flow statement.\nOperating revenue is realized through a business' primary activity, such as selling its products. Non-operating revenue comes from ancillary sources such as interest income from capital held in a bank or income from rental of business property.\nThe income and expense components can help an investor learn what makes a company profitable (or not). Competitors can use them to measure how their company compares on various measures. Research analysts use them to compare performance year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter.\nAn income statement provides valuable insights into various aspects of a business. It includes readings on a company\u2019s operations, the efficiency of its management, the possible leaky areas that may be eroding\u00a0profits, and whether the company is performing in line with industry peers.\nAccountingTools. \u201cIncome Statement Definition.\u201d\nMicrosoft, via U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cForm 10-K for the Fiscal Year Ended June 30,

Definition, Meaning, Types, and Examples": {"text": "Ariel Courage is an experienced editor, researcher, and former fact-checker. She has performed editing and fact-checking work for several leading finance publications, including The Motley Fool and Passport to Wall Street.\nInvestopedia / Sydney Saporito\nAn acquisition is when one company purchases most or all of another company's shares to gain control of that company. Purchasing more than 50% of a target firm's stock and other assets allows the acquirer to make decisions about the newly acquired assets without the approval of the company\u2019s other shareholders.\u00a0Acquisitions, which are very common in business, may occur with the target company's approval, or in spite of its disapproval. With approval, there is often a no-shop clause during the process.\nWe mostly hear about acquisitions of large well-known companies because these huge and significant deals tend to dominate the news. In reality, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) occur more regularly between small- to medium-size firms than between large companies.\nCompanies acquire other companies for various reasons. They may seek economies of scale, diversification, greater market share, increased synergy, cost reductions, or new niche offerings. Other reasons for acquisitions include those listed below.\nIf a company wants to expand its operations to another country, buying an existing company in that country could be the easiest way to enter a foreign market. The purchased business will already have its own personnel, a brand name, and other intangible assets, which could help to ensure that the acquiring company will start off in a new market with a solid base.\nPerhaps a company met with physical or logistical constraints or depleted its resources. If a company is encumbered in this way, then it's often sounder to acquire another firm than to expand its own. Such a company might look for promising young companies to acquire and incorporate into its revenue stream as a new way to profit.\nIf there is too much competition or supply, companies may look to acquisitions to reduce excess capacity, eliminate the competition, and focus on the most productive providers.\nSometimes it can be more cost-efficient for a company to purchase another company that already has implemented a new technology successfully than to spend the time and money to develop the new technology itself.\nOfficers of companies have a fiduciary duty to perform thorough due diligence of target companies before making any acquisition.\nAlthough technically, the words \"acquisition\" and \"takeover\" mean almost the same thing, they have different nuances on Wall Street.\nIn general, \"acquisition\" describes a primarily amicable transaction, where both firms cooperate; \"takeover\" suggests that\u00a0the target company resists or strongly opposes the purchase; the term \"merger\" is used when the purchasing and target companies mutually combine to form a completely new entity. However, because each acquisition, takeover, and merger is a unique case, with its own peculiarities and reasons for undertaking the transaction, the exact use of these terms tends to overlap in practice.\nFriendly acquisitions occur when the target firm agrees to be acquired; its board of directors (B of D, or board) approves of the acquisition. Friendly acquisitions often work toward the mutual benefit of the acquiring and target companies. Both companies develop strategies to ensure that the acquiring company purchases the appropriate assets, and they review the financial statements and other valuations for any obligations that may come with the assets. Once both parties agree to the terms and meet any legal stipulations, the purchase proceeds.\nUnfriendly acquisitions, commonly known as \"hostile takeovers,\" occur when the target company does not consent to the acquisition. Hostile acquisitions don't have the same agreement from the target firm, and so the acquiring firm must actively purchase large stakes of the target company to gain a controlling interest, which forces the acquisition.\nEven if a takeover is not exactly hostile, it implies that the firms are not equal in one or more significant ways.\nAs the mutual fusion of two companies into one new legal entity, a merger is a more-than-friendly acquisition. Mergers generally occur between companies that are roughly equal in terms of their basic characteristics\u2014size, number of customers, the scale of operations, and so on. The merging companies strongly believe that their combined entity would be more valuable to all parties (especially shareholders) than either one could be alone.\nBefore making an acquisition, it is imperative for a company to evaluate whether its target company is a good candidate.\nIn corporate America, the 1990s will be remembered as the decade of the internet bubble and the megadeal. The late 1990s, in particular, spawned a series of multi-billion-dollar acquisitions not seen on Wall Street since the junk bond fests of the roaring 1980s. From Yahoo!'s 1999 $5.7-billion purchase of Broadcast.com to AtHome\u00a0Corporation's $7.5-billion purchase of Excite, companies were lapping up the \"growth now, profitability later\" phenomenon. Such acquisitions reached their zenith in the first few weeks of 2000.\nAOL Inc. (originally America Online) was the most publicized online service of its time, and had been extolled as \"the company that brought the internet to America.\" Founded in 1985, by the year 2000 AOL had grown to become the United States' largest internet provider. Meanwhile, the legendary media conglomerate, Time Warner, Inc. was being labeled an \"old media\" company, given its range of tangible businesses like publishing, and television, and an enviable income statement.\nIn 2000, in a masterful display of overweening confidence, the young upstart AOL purchased the venerable giant Time Warner (TWX) for $165 billion; this dwarfed all records and became the biggest merger in history. The vision was that the new entity, AOL Time Warner, would become a dominant force in the news, publishing, music, entertainment, cable, and Internet industries. After the merger, AOL became the largest technology company in\u00a0America.\nHowever, the joint phase lasted less than a decade. As AOL lost value and\u00a0the dot-com bubble burst,\u00a0the expected successes of the merger\u00a0failed to materialize, and\u00a0AOL and Time Warner dissolved their union:\nThen, in October 2016, AT&T (NYSE: T)\u00a0and Time Warner (TWX) announced a deal in which AT&T will buy Time Warner for $85.4 billion, morphing AT&T into a media heavy-hitter. In June 2018, after a protracted court battle, AT&T completed its acquisition of Time Warner.\nCertainly, the AT&T-Time Warner acquisition deal of 2018 will be as historically significant as the AOL-Time Warner deal of 2000; we just can't know exactly how yet. These days, 18 years equals numerous lifetimes\u2014especially in media, communications, and technology\u2014and much will continue to change. For the moment, however, two things seem certain:\nOften, a business combination like an acquisition or merger can be categorized in one of four ways:\nAcquiring other companies can serve many purposes for the parent company. First, it can allow the company to expand its product lines or offerings. Second, it can cut down costs by acquiring businesses that feed into its supply chain. It can also acquire competitors in order to maintain market share and reduce competition.\nThe main difference is that in an acquisition, the parent company fully takes over the target company and integrates it into the parent entity. In a merger, the two companies combine, but create a brand new entity (e.g., a new company name and identity that combines aspects of both).\nWall Street Journal. \"AtHome Agrees to Acquire Excite In Stock Deal Valued at $7.5 Billion.\"\nCNN Money. \"Yahoo!

and personal finance and over twenty years of experience in the classroom.\nRevenue\u00a0and retained earnings provide insights into a company\u2019s financial performance. Revenue is a critical component of the income statement. It reveals the \"top line\" of the company or the sales a company has made during the period. Retained earnings are an accumulation of a company's net income and net losses over all the years the business has been operating. Retained earnings make up part of the stockholder's equity on the balance sheet.\nRevenue is the income earned from selling goods or services produced. Retained earnings are the amount of net income retained by a company. Both revenue and retained earnings can be important in evaluating\u00a0a company's financial management.\nRevenue provides managers and stakeholders with a metric for evaluating the success of a company in terms of demand for its product. Revenue\u00a0sits\u00a0at the top of the\u00a0income statement. As a result, it is often referred to as the top-line number when describing a company's\u00a0financial performance. Since revenue\u00a0is\u00a0the income\u00a0earned by a company, it\u00a0is\u00a0the income generated\u00a0before the\u00a0cost of goods sold (COGS), operating expenses, capital\u00a0costs, and taxes are deducted.\nGross sales are calculated by adding all sales receipts before discounts, returns, and allowances. For smaller companies, this may be as easy as calculating the number of products sold by the sales price. For larger, more complex companies, this will be all units sold across all product lines.\nNet sales are calculated as gross revenues net of discounts, returns, and allowances. Though gross revenue is helpful in accounting for, it may be misleading as it does not fully encapsulate the activity regarding sale activity. For example, a company may post record-level sales; however, a major recall that resulted in 10% of all sales being returned will have material consequences on net revenue.\nRevenue is often the first determinant in deciding how a company performed. If revenue is up, the company did great. If revenue is down, that's not the case.\nRevenue is used to pay the expenses of a company. These expenses often go hand-in-hand with the manufacture and distribution of products. For example, a company may pay facilities costs for its corporate headquarters; by selling products, the company hopes to pay its facilities costs and have money left over.\nRevenue on the\u00a0income statement\u00a0is often a focus for many stakeholders, but the impact of a company's revenues affects the balance sheet. If the company makes cash sales, a company's balance sheet reflects higher cash balances. Companies that invoice their sales for payment at a later date will report this revenue as accounts receivable.\nThe critical piece to note here is that revenue does not equal cash. If a company sells a product to a customer and the customer goes bankrupt, the company technically still reports that sale as revenue. It also recognizes a loss on the cash it should have received. Therefore, revenue is only useful in determining cash flow when considering the company's ability to turnover its inventory and collect its receivables.\nRevenue and retained earnings are correlated since a\u00a0portion of revenue ultimately becomes net income and later retained earnings.\nRetained earnings\u00a0are a portion of a company's profit\u00a0that is held or retained from net income at the end of a reporting period and saved for future use as shareholder\u2019s equity. Retained earnings are also the key component of shareholder\u2019s equity that helps a company determine its book value.\nIt's important to note that retained earnings are an\u00a0accumulating balance within shareholder\u2019s equity on the balance sheet. Once retained earnings are reported on the balance sheet, it becomes a part of a company\u2019s total book value. On the balance sheet, the retained earnings value can fluctuate from\u00a0accumulation or use over many quarters or years.\nAt each reporting date, companies add net income to the retained earnings, net of any deductions. Dividends, which are a distribution of a company's equity to the shareholders, are deducted from net income because the dividend reduces the amount of equity left in the company.\nBalance sheet retained earnings can be calculated by taking the beginning balance of retained earnings on the balance sheet,\u00a0adding the\u00a0net income\u00a0(or loss) for a period, and\u00a0subtracting any\u00a0dividends\u00a0planned to be paid to shareholders.\nFor example,\u00a0consider a company with:\nRetained earnings is calculated as the beginning balance ($5,000) plus net income (+$4,000) less dividends paid (-$2,000). The company would now have $7,000 of retained earnings at the end of the period.\nRetained earnings is a figure used to analyze a company's longer-term finances. It can help determine if a company has enough money to pay its obligations and continue growing. Retained earnings can also indicate something about the maturity of a company\u2014if the company has been in operation long enough, it may not need to hold on to these earnings. In this case, dividends can be paid out to stockholders, or extra cash might be put to use.\nThe amount of\u00a0profit retained often provides insight into a company\u2019s maturity. More mature companies generate more net income and give more to shareholders. Less mature companies need to retain more profit in shareholder\u2019s equity for stability. This concept plays into value stocks and growth stocks; value stocks may be more likely to issue a dividend with excess cash if the company is more established, while growth stocks may be more likely to experience capital appreciation and deploy cash for growth.\nShareholder equity (also referred to as \"shareholders' equity\") is made up of paid-in capital, retained earnings, and other comprehensive income after liabilities have been paid. Paid-in capital comprises amounts contributed by shareholders during an equity-raising event. Other comprehensive income includes items not shown in the income statement but which affect a company's book value of equity. Pensions and foreign exchange translations are examples of these transactions.\nSince net income is added to retained earnings each period, retained earnings directly affect shareholders' equity. In turn, this affects metrics such as return on equity (ROE), or the amount of profits made per dollar of book value. Once companies are earning a steady profit, it typically behooves them to pay out dividends to their shareholders to keep shareholder equity at a targeted level and ROE high.\nShareholder equity is the amount invested in a business by those who hold company shares\u2014shareholders are a public company's owners.\nRevenue is heavily dependent on the demand for a company\u2019s product. Gross revenue takes into consideration COGS. Gross revenue is the total amount of revenue generated after COGS but before any operating and capital expenses. Thus, gross revenue does not consider a company\u2019s ability to manage its operating and capital expenditures. However, it can be affected by a company\u2019s ability to competitively price products and manufacture its offerings.\nRetained earnings is much more holistic. In addition to considering revenue, it is impacted by the company's cost of goods sold, operating expenses, taxes, interest, depreciation, and other costs. It may also be directly reduced by capital awarded to shareholders through dividends. Therefore, while the scope of revenue is more narrow, the impact to retained earnings is much more far-reaching.\nRetained earnings differ from revenue because they are reported on different financial statements. Retained earnings resides on the balance sheet in the form of residual value of the company, while revenue resides on the income statement.\nWhen revenue is shown on the income statement, it is reported for a specific period often shorter than one year. A company can pull together internal reports that extend this reporting period, but revenue is often looked at on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. For example, companies often prepare comparative income statements to analyze reports over several years.\nRetained earnings, on the other hand, are reported as a rolling total from the inception of the company. At the end of every year, the company's net income gets rolled into retained earnings. Therefore, a single number of retained earnings could contain decades of historical value accumulated over a much longer reporting period.\nIt is no coincidence that revenue is reported at the top of the income statement; it is the primary driver a company's profitability and often the highest-level, most visible aspect of a company's analysis. Because expenses have yet to be deducted, revenue is the highest number reported on the income statement.\nOn the other hand, retained earnings is a \"bottom-line\" reporting account that is only calculated after all other calculations have been settled. Ending retained earnings is at the bottom of the statement of changes to retained earnings which is only assembled after net income (the \"true\" bottom line) has been determined.\nCompanies may have different strategic plans regarding revenue and retained earnings. Most, if not all, companies attempt to maximize revenue. Even if there are constraints or limitations to the organization, most companies will attempt to sell as much product as it can to maximize revenue.\nRetained earnings isn't as straightforward as it may not be advantageous to maximize retained earnings. A company may decide it is more beneficial to return capital to shareholders in the form of dividends. A company may also decide it is more beneficial to reinvest funds into the company by acquiring capital assets or expanding operations. Most companies may argue that an idle retained earnings balance that is not being deployed over the long-term is inefficient.\nInfluenced by only inputs to products sold and pricing\nReported on the income statement\nIs often analyzed on a shorter timeframe\nVery high-level calculation that does not have many inputs\nCompanies often strive to maximize revenue\nInfluenced by all aspects of revenue and expenses\nReported on the balance sheet\nIs often compiled over a longer timeframe\nVery low-level calculation that is prepared after essentially all other financial records are prepared\nCompanies may wish to minimize retained earnings and prioritize dividends/growth\nNet income\u00a0is the profit earned\u00a0for a period. It is calculated by subtracting all the costs of doing business from a company\u2019s revenue. Those costs may include COGS and operating expenses such as mortgage payments, rent, utilities, payroll,\u00a0and general costs. Other costs deducted from revenue to arrive at net income can include investment losses, debt interest payments, and taxes.\nNet income is the first component of a retained earnings calculation on a periodic reporting basis. Net income is often called\u00a0the bottom line since it sits at the bottom of the income statement and provides detail on a company\u2019s earnings after all expenses have been paid. Any net income not paid to shareholders at the end of a reporting period becomes retained earnings.\u00a0Retained earnings are then carried over to the balance sheet, reported under shareholder\u2019s equity.\nYou use information from the beginning and end of the period plus profits, losses, and dividends to calculate retained earnings. The formula is:\nBeginning Retained Earnings + Profits/Losses - Dividends = Ending Retained Earnings.\nRetained earnings are left over profits after accounting for dividends and payouts to investors. If dividends are granted, they are generally given out after the company pays all of its other obligations, so retained earnings are what is left after expenses and distributions are paid.\nRetained earnings is the residual value of a company after its expenses have been paid and dividends issued to shareholders. Retained earnings represents the amount of value a company has \"saved up\" each year as unspent net income. Should the company decide to have expenses exceed revenue in a future year, the company can draw down retained earnings to cover the shortage.\nRevenue and retained earnings have different levels of importance depending on what the underlying company is trying to achieve. Revenue is incredibly important, especially for growth companies try to establish themselves in a market. However, retained earnings may be even more important for companies who have been saving capital to deploy for capital expansion or heavy investment into the business.\nAs a company sells products or services, it earns revenue. It uses that revenue to pay expenses and, if the company sold enough goods, it earns a profit. This profit can be carried into future periods in an accounting balance called retained earnings. While revenue focuses on the short-term earnings of a company reported on the income statement, retained earnings of a company is reported on the balance sheet as the overall residual value of the company.\nAccounting Tools. \"Revenue Definition.\"\nAccounting Tools. \"The Difference Between Gross Sales and Net Sales.\"\nAccounting Tools. \"Retained Earnings Definition.\"\nAccounting Tools.

Diaz\nAn economy is a complex system of interrelated production, consumption, and exchange activities that ultimately determines how resources are allocated among all the participants. The production, consumption, and distribution of goods and services combine to fulfill the needs of those living and operating within the economy.\nAn economy may represent a nation, a region, a single industry, or even a family.\nAn economy encompasses all of the activities related to the production, consumption, and trade of goods and services in an entity, whether the entity is a nation or a small town.\nNo two economies are identical. Each is formed according to its own resources, culture, laws, history, and geography. Each evolves according to the choices and actions of the participants.\nThese decisions are made through some combination of market transactions and collective or hierarchical decision-making.\nCapitalism requires a market-based economy. Communism requires a command-based economy.\nIn the modern world, few nations are purely market-based or purely command-based. But most lean toward one or the other of these models.\nMarket-based or \"free market\" economies allow people and businesses to freely exchange goods and services according to supply and demand.\nThe United States is mostly a market economy. Producers determine what\u2019s sold and produced, and what prices to charge. If they expect to succeed, they will produce what consumers want and charge what consumers are willing to pay.\nThrough these decisions, the laws of supply and demand determine prices and total production. If consumer demand for a specific product increases, production tends to increase to satisfy the demand. The increased demand causes prices to rise until consumers balk and cut back on their purchases. Demand for the product will then decline and prices will decline with it.\nThis constant tug of supply and demand allows a market economy a tendency to naturally balance itself. As the prices in one sector rise with demand, the money and labor needed to fill that demand shift to those places where they're needed.\nCommand-based economies depend on a central government that controls the production levels, pricing, and distribution of goods.\nIn such a system, the government owns industries deemed essential on behalf of the consumers who use them. Competition among companies is discouraged or banned. Prices are controlled.\nCommunism requires a command-based economy. Contemporary examples include Cuba and North Korea.\nA command-based economy attempts to supersede the workings of supply and demand.\nPure market economies rarely exist in the modern world since there's usually some degree of government intervention or central planning. Even the United States could be considered a mixed economy. It may not mandate production but it has ways to influence it. For example:\nIn truth, most of the world's developed economies mix market-based and command-based models.\nChina had a command economy only until 1978 when it began a series of reforms that encouraged private enterprise.\nThe study of economies and the factors affecting economies is called economics. The discipline of economics can be broken into two major areas of focus, microeconomics, and macroeconomics.\nMicroeconomics studies the behavior of individual people and businesses in order to understand why they make the economic decisions they do and how these decisions affect the larger economic system.\nMicroeconomics studies how a particular value is attached to a product or service. It examines how individuals coordinate and cooperate with each other in business.\nMicroeconomics tends to focus on economic tendencies, such as how individual choices and actions impact changes in production.\nClearly, principles of psychology and marketing influence microeconomics.\nAs the name implies, macroeconomics studies the big picture.\nMacroeconomics includes the study of economy-wide factors such as the effect of rising prices or inflation on the economy. It seeks to track and understand the financial indicators that clarify an economy's success or failure over time, such as gross domestic product (GDP), changes in unemployment, and consumer spending.\nIn short, macroeconomics studies how the economy as a whole behaves.\nAs noted above, macroeconomics is the study of the big picture and that picture is incomplete without a set of economic indicators. These are some of the most closely-watched of those indicators.\nGross domestic product is the total value of all of the completed goods and services produced by an economy during a period of one year.\nThe gross domestic product of the United States was about $23 trillion in 2021.\nThe Unemployment Report estimates the number of people who are working for pay during a given period. More importantly, the number is tracked over time in order to determine whether unemployment is worsening.\nIn the U.S., the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) publishes a monthly unemployment report that breaks down how many people are working, the average number of hours they are working, and their average earnings. This is used to produce the unemployment rate.\nInflation in consumer prices is measured and tracked so that problems in the economy can be pinpointed. If the rate of inflation is outpacing the rate of income growth, the economy is in trouble. Inflation can be negative, too, but overall deflation is relatively rare.\nThe BLS also publishes a key inflation report for the U.S. The Consumer Price Index tracks the costs of goods and services from month to month. It breaks down its report into the vital areas of consumer spending, such as food, energy, and rent costs.\nThose numbers determine the rate of inflation.\nAn economy's balance of trade is a comparison of the amount of money that is spent on imports of goods and services and the amount of money it earns on goods and services it exports. It is measured primarily by recording all of the products that pass through the Customs office of a country.\nA nation achieves a positive balance of trade when it exports more than it imports. It has a negative balance of trade when it buys more than it sells.\nNeither is necessarily good or bad. A nation may have a negative balance of trade because foreign businesses are heavily investing in its future. A nation with a positive balance of trade may have protectionist policies in place that could hurt it in the long run.\nThe U.S. had a balance of trade deficit in 2021 of about $859.1 billion, up $182.4 billion from the previous year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.\nThe word economy derives from the Greek term for household management and the word is still used in that context.\nEconomics as an area of study was touched on by philosophers in ancient Greece, notably Aristotle, but the modern study of economics began in 18th century Europe, particularly in Scotland and France.\nThe Scottish philosopher and economist Adam Smith, who in 1776 wrote a landmark book called The Wealth of Nations, was thought of in his own time as a moral philosopher. He and his contemporaries traced the evolution of economies from prehistoric bartering systems to money-driven and eventually credit-driven economies.\nDuring the 19th century, the development of technology and the growth of international trade created stronger ties among countries, a process that accelerated into the Great Depression and World War II. After 50 years of the Cold War, the late 20th and early 21st centuries have seen a renewed globalization of economies.\nEconomics is a branch of the sciences that seeks to understand the way a population functions by studying the way its economy functions. Every group of people develops a survival plan based on shared labor and resources. How they do that, and how well they succeed at it, is the study of economics.\nMacroeconomics is the study of the overall performance of an economy. It evaluates the stability and progress of an economy over time by analysis of key indicators. These include gross domestic product (GDP), employment, inflation or deflation, and the balance of trade.\nMicronomics is the study of the behavior of the individual consumers and businesses that make up the economy. Their motivations, habits, and behaviors are studied to determine whether an economy is functioning in their best interests.\nAll of us participate in an economy, with the possible exception of a hermit living on a desert island. We contribute something to the whole, by producing or helping to produce a product or offering a service. In return, we receive money that allows us to buy the goods and services that we can't produce for ourselves.\nAn economy is a community that is observed by an analysis of its allocation of resources. Every individual and family in the community has a contribution to make. In return, each expects a share of the goods and services provided by other members of the community.\nIn modern times, the functioning of an economy is analyzed and quantified by economists.\nThe

interest rates by 0.75 percentage point for second consecutive time to fight inflation.\"\nWorld Bank. \"The World Bank in China.\"\nStatista. \"Gross domestic product of the United States at current

A company's inventory typically involves goods in three stages of production: raw goods, in-progress goods, and finished goods that are ready for sale. Inventory accounting will assign values to the items in each of these three processes and record them as company assets. Assets are goods that will likely be of future value to the company, so they need to be accurately valued in order for the company to have a precise valuation.\nInventory items at any of the three production stages can change in value. Changes in value can occur for a number of reasons including depreciation, deterioration, obsolescence, change in customer taste, increased demand, decreased market supply, and so on. An accurate inventory accounting system will keep track of these changes to inventory goods at all three production stages and adjust company asset values and the costs associated with the inventory accordingly.\nGAAP requires inventory to be properly accounted for according to a very particular set of standards, to limit the potential of overstating profit by understating inventory value. Profit is revenue minus costs. Revenue is generated by selling inventory. If the inventory value (or cost) is understated, then the profit associated with the sale of the inventory may be overstated. That can potentially inflate the company's valuation.\nThe other item the GAAP rules guard against is the potential for a company to overstate its value by overstating the value of inventory. Since inventory is an asset, it affects the overall value of the company. A company which is manufacturing or selling an outdated item might see a decrease in the value of its inventory. Unless this is accurately captured in the company financials, the value of the company's assets and thus the company itself might be inflated.\nThe main advantage of inventory accounting is to have an accurate representation of the company's financial health. However, there are some additional advantages to keeping track of the value of items through their respective production stages. Namely, inventory accounting allows businesses to assess where they may be able to increase profit margins on a product at a particular place in that product's cycle.\nThis can be seen most prominently in products that require exceptional time or expense in secondary stages of production. Items such as pharmaceuticals, machinery, and technology are three products that require large amounts of expense after their initial designing. By evaluating the value of the product at a certain stage\u2060\u2014such as clinical trials or transportation of the product\u2060\u2014a company can adjust the variables at that stage to keep the product value the same while increasing their profit margins by decreasing expenses.\nAccounting\nAccounting\nFinancial Statements\nFundamental Analysis\nFinancial Statements\nNews", "links":
