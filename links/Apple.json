It\u2019s also one of our core values. Which is why we design our products and services to protect it. That\u2019s the kind of innovation we believe\u00a0in.\nSimple. Secure. So not a password.\nA passkey eliminates the need for a password by using a unique digital key that only works from the site or app it was created for, so you don\u2019t have to worry about website leaks or phishing. Passkeys are securely synced across Apple devices. Just use Touch\u00a0ID or Face\u00a0ID to authenticate and you\u2019re\u00a0done.\nNew\nKeep Hiddenand RecentlyDeleted photosprivate.\nYour Hidden and Recently Deleted albums in Photos are locked by default and can be unlocked using your device\u2019s authentication method \u2014 Face\u00a0ID, Touch\u00a0ID, or your\u00a0passcode.\nNew\nTake\u00a0controlin times of crisis.\nSafety Check is a new section in Settings that helps people in domestic or intimate partner violence situations quickly reset the access they\u2019ve granted to others. It also helps you manage which people and apps you\u2019ve given access\u00a0to.\nLearn more about personal safety with Apple\u00a0devices\nNew\nDecide whichapps areallowed totracktracktracktrack you.\nMake more informed choices about the apps you use and the permissions you grant them. Apps are required to ask your permission when they want to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies. And you can change your preference for any app or prevent apps from asking for permission entirely in\u00a0Settings.\nReadRead, delete,and replywith peaceof mind.\nMail Privacy Protection hides your IP address, so senders can\u2019t link it to your other online activity or determine your location. And it prevents senders from seeing if and when you\u2019ve opened their\u00a0email.\nSafari throws trackers off your\u00a0trail.\nSome websites allow hundreds of different data collection companies to watch you, build a profile of you, and serve you ads as you browse the web. Intelligent Tracking Prevention in Safari uses on-device machine learning to help block those trackers. And you can get a snapshot of all the cross-site trackers Safari is blocking by visiting your Privacy Report in the Safari\u00a0toolbar.\nAdvertisers can also create a \u201cfingerprint\u201d of your device to target you based on characteristics like your browser configuration, and fonts and plug-ins you\u2019ve installed. To help prevent this, Safari has built-in fingerprinting defense, which shares a simplified system profile with websites you visit. Making it even more difficult for data companies to identify\u00a0you.\nHealth keeps your\u00a0records under\u00a0wraps.\nFrom your heart rate to your menstrual cycle, apps and devices for your health can give you insight into some of your most personal details. With the Health app, you\u2019re in charge of what information you\u2019d like to include, what not to, and who has access to\u00a0it.\nWhen you do want to securely share your health data from the Health app with your doctors, they\u2019ll see the data you shared in a dashboard in the provider\u2019s health records\u00a0system.\nAll of your data is encrypted and only accessible with your passcode, Touch\u00a0ID, or Face\u00a0ID. So however you use the Health app, you\u2019re always in control of your\u00a0data.\nWallet and Apple Pay help hide what you\u00a0buy.\nWhat you buy, where you bought it, and how much you paid is sensitive information. Apple doesn\u2019t store, sell, or use any of that\u00a0information.\nApple doesn\u2019t store your credit or debit card numbers or share them with merchants. Instead, a unique Device Account Number is created every time you add a card to Apple\u00a0Pay. And with Apple\u00a0Card, your spending history is generated right on your iPhone, so Apple doesn\u2019t have\u00a0it.\nMaps makes your location history,\u00a0history.\nWhere you go says a lot about you. Maps delivers a great experience without Apple knowing which stores, neighborhoods, or clinics you visit. And because Maps doesn\u2019t include a sign-in, where you go isn\u2019t associated with your Apple\u00a0ID at\u00a0all.\nPersonalized features, like locating your parked car, are created right on your device. Data used to improve navigation, such as routes and search terms, is not associated with your identity. Instead, that information is based on random identifiers that are constantly\u00a0changing.\nPhotos lets you choose who has the full picture.\nYour photo and video albums are full of precious moments, friends, and your favorite things. Apple devices are designed to give you control over those\u00a0memories.\nPhotos is also designed so that the face recognition and scene and object detection \u2014 which power features like For You, Memories, Sharing Suggestions, and the People album \u2014 happen on device instead of in the cloud. In fact, the A13\u00a0Bionic and later chips perform over 100 billion operations per photo to recognize faces and places without ever leaving your device. And when apps request access to your photos, you can share just the images you want \u2014 not your entire\u00a0library.\nMessages\u00a0are\u00a0only seen by who\u00a0you send them\u00a0to.\nFrom inside jokes to invitations, a lot of life happens in text and video chats. Every blue-bubble message, picture, Animoji, and video is encrypted while being sent between\u00a0devices.\nSmart suggestions in Messages, like pulling up photos to send based on who you\u2019re messaging, are all done on your\u00a0device.\nSiri\u00a0learns\u00a0what you need. Not who you\u00a0are.\nSiri was designed from the beginning to learn your preferences without sharing your identity with Apple or anyone else. You don\u2019t sign in with your Apple\u00a0ID to use Siri, and the audio of your requests is processed entirely on your device thanks to the power of the Apple\u00a0Neural\u00a0Engine.\nWhen Apple does process or store data on our servers, it\u2019s associated with a random identifier \u2014 a long string of letters and numbers. That data is used only to improve Siri, and we never share or sell it. Apple doesn\u2019t retain audio of your requests unless you choose to share it with us to improve\u00a0Siri.\nApple\u00a0News leaves what you read off the record.\nMany news sources keep track of your identity and create a profile of you. Apple\u00a0News delivers personalized content without knowing who you are. The content you read is associated with a random identifier, not your Apple\u00a0ID.\nYou get editor-curated content and a personalized newsfeed so you can stay up to date with the latest news and stories. And because Apple\u00a0News uses machine learning, the more you use it, the better your app gets to know what you like \u2014 without Apple ever knowing what you\u2019re\u00a0into.\nApp\u00a0Store shows you what\u2019s in store for your\u00a0data.\nEvery one of the more than 1.8 million apps on the App\u00a0Store is required to follow strict privacy guidelines and report how it uses your data. And every app is rigorously reviewed by a team of experts at\u00a0Apple.\nWhen you\u2019re checking out an app, you\u2019ll see its Privacy Nutrition Label to help you decide if it works for you. Apps you choose to download need your permission to access information like your photos or location \u2014 and you can always change your mind about what you share. iOS\u00a014.5 and iPadOS\u00a014.5 or later require developers to get your permission before tracking your activity across other companies\u2019 apps and websites for ads or data\u00a0brokers.\nBuilt-in privacy features on iPhone help keep you in control of your data.\nWatch the film\nGo further.
