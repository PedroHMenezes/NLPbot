{"Overview | Planets \u2013 NASA Solar System Exploration": {"text": "There are more planets than stars in our galaxy. The current count orbiting our star: eight.\nThe inner, rocky planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. NASA's newest rover \u2014 Perseverance \u2014 landed on Mars on Feb. 18, 2021. The outer planets are gas giants Jupiter and Saturn and ice giants Uranus and Neptune.\nBeyond Neptune, a newer class of smaller worlds called dwarf planets reign, including longtime favorite Pluto. Thousands more planets have been discovered beyond our solar system. Scientists call them exoplanets (exo means \"from outside\").\nEverything you need to know about planets.\nWhat is a Planet?\nThe key difference between a planet and a dwarf planet is the kinds of objects that share its orbit around the Sun. Pluto, for example, has not cleared its orbit of similar objects while Earth or Jupiter have no similarly-sized worlds on the same path around the Sun. Like planets, dwarf planets are generally round (Haumea looks like an overinflated football) and orbit the Sun.\nThere are likely thousands of dwarf planets waiting to be discovered beyond Neptune. The five best-known dwarf planets are Ceres, Pluto, Makemake, Haumea, and Eris. Except for Ceres, which lies in the main asteroid belt, these small worlds are located in the Kuiper Belt. They\u2019re considered dwarfs because they are massive, round, and orbit the Sun, but haven't cleared their orbital path.\nThis simulated view of our solar system at the top of this page (and below) runs on real data. The position of the planets, moons, and spacecraft are shown where they are right now. This digital orrery (a model of the solar system) runs on a light, mobile-mobile friendly version of NASA's Eyes on the Solar System software.\nThis snapshot focuses on active NASA missions and select ESA missions. Showcasing the entire operating international fleet is too much of a data wallop at the moment (but we are working on it!). Active international missions such as Japan's Akatsuki Venus Orbiter and ESA and Japan's Mercury-bound BepiColombo are not yet available.\nUse the HD button to upload higher-resolution imagery of the planets. It may not work properly on older mobile devices. Have fun, and keep exploring.\nScience Writers: \nPhil Davis & Steve Carney\n\nSocial Media Lead: \nBill Dunford\n\nDesign & Development: \nMoore Boeck\nSite last updated: March 28, 2023", "links":

System Exploration": {"text": "Earth's Moon is the only place beyond Earth where humans have set foot.\nThe brightest and largest object in our night sky, the Moon makes Earth a more livable planet by moderating our home planet's wobble on its axis, leading to a relatively stable climate. It also causes tides, creating a rhythm that has guided humans for thousands of years. The Moon was likely formed after a Mars-sized body collided with Earth.\nEarth's Moon is the fifth largest of the 200+ moons orbiting planets in our solar system.\nEarth's only natural satellite is simply called \"the Moon\" because people didn't know other moons existed until Galileo Galilei discovered four moons orbiting Jupiter in 1610.\nNASA currently has three robotic spacecraft exploring the Moon \u2013 Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and the twin ARTEMIS spacecraft (not to be confused with NASA's new Artemis program to send astronauts back to the Moon).\nEverything you need to know your moon.\nEarth's Moon In Depth\nIf you set a single green pea next to a U.S. nickel, you'd have a pretty good idea of the size of the Moon compared to Earth.\nThe Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It goes around the Earth at a distance of about 239,000 miles (385,000 kilometers).\nThe Earth and Moon are tidally locked. Their rotations are so in sync\u00a0we only see one side of the Moon. Humans didn't see the lunar far side until a Soviet spacecraft flew past in 1959.\nThe Moon has a solid, rocky surface\u00a0cratered and pitted from impacts by asteroids, meteorites, and comets.\nThe Moon has a very thin and tenuous atmosphere called an exosphere. It is not breathable.\nThe Moon has no moons.\nThe Moon has no rings.\nMore than 105\u00a0robotic spacecraft have been launched to explore the Moon. It is the only celestial body beyond Earth \u2013 so far \u2013 visited by human beings.\nThe Moon's weak atmosphere and its lack of liquid water cannot support life as we know it.\nApollo astronauts brought back a total of 842 pounds (382 kilograms) of lunar rocks and soil to Earth. We are still studying them.\nThe Moon was the first place beyond Earth humans tried to reach as the Space Age began in the late 1950s. More than 100 robotic explorers from more than half a dozen nations have since sent spacecraft to the Moon. Nine crewed missions have flown to the Moon and back.\nThe former Soviet Union logged the first successes with its Luna program, starting with Luna 1 in 1959. NASA followed with a series of robotic Ranger and Surveyor spacecraft that performed increasingly complex tasks that made it possible for the first human beings to walk on the Moon in 1969.\nTwenty-four humans have traveled from the Earth to the Moon. Twelve walked on its surface. The last human visited the lunar surface in 1972.\nNow NASA is gearing up to set up a permanent lunar presence on the Moon. The Artemis program will send the first woman and the next man to the Moon and develop a sustainable human presence on the Moon and set the stage for further human exploration of Mars.\nThe program takes its name from the twin sister of Apollo and the goddess of the Moon in Greek mythology. Artemis 1, formerly Exploration Mission-1, is the first in a series of increasingly complex missions that will enable human exploration of the Moon and Mars.\nMore\nDuring a lunar eclipse, Earth comes between the Sun and the Moon, blocking the sunlight from falling on the Moon. There are two kinds of lunar eclipses:\nDuring some stages of a lunar eclipse, the Moon can appear reddish. This is because the only remaining sunlight reaching the Moon at that point is from around the edges of the Earth, as seen from the Moon's surface. From there, an observer during an eclipse would see all of Earth's sunrises and sunsets at once.\nOur lunar neighbor has inspired stories since the first humans looked up at the sky and saw its gray, cratered surface. Some observers saw among the craters the shape of a person's face, so stories refer to a mysterious \"man in the Moon.\" Hungrier observers compared the craters to cheese and dreamed of an entire sphere made of delicious dairy products.\nThe Moon made its film debut in a 1902 black and white silent French film called \"Le Voyage Dans la Lune\" (\"A Trip to the Moon\"). And a year before astronauts walked on the Moon, \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" (1968) told the story of astronauts on an outpost on the Moon. Decades later, it is still widely regarded as one of the best science fiction movies ever made.\nAmerican astronauts have planted six American flags on the Moon. But that doesn't mean the United States has claimed it; in fact, an international law written in 1967 prevents any single nation from owning planets, stars, or any other natural objects in space.\nMost of the planets in our solar system \u2013 and some asteroids \u2013 have moons. Earth has one moon. We call it \"the Moon\" because for a long time it was the only one we knew about. Many languages have beautiful names for our Moon. It is \"Luna\" in Italian, Latin, and Spanish, \"Lune\" in French, \"Mond\" in German, and \"Selene\" in Greek.\nOur Moon is like a desert with plains, mountains, and valleys. It also has many craters, holes created when space rocks hit the surface at a high speed. There is no air to breathe on the Moon.\nThe Moon travels around the Earth in an oval-shaped orbit. Scientists think the Moon was formed long, long ago when Earth crashed into a Mars-sized object.\nWe always see the same side of the Moon from Earth. You have to go into space to see the other side.\nVisit NASA Space Place for more kid-friendly facts.\nScience Writers: \nPhil Davis & Steve Carney\n\nSocial Media Lead: \nBill Dunford\n\nDesign &

| Our Solar System \u2013 NASA Solar System Exploration": {"text": "There are many planetary systems like ours in the universe, with planets orbiting a host star. Our planetary system is called \u201cthe solar system\u201d because we use the word \u201csolar\u201d to describe things related to our star, after the Latin word for Sun, \"solis.\"\nOur planetary system is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy.\nOur solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity \u2013 the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune; dwarf planets such as Pluto; dozens of moons; and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids. Beyond our own solar system, we have discovered thousands of planetary systems orbiting other stars in the Milky Way.\nEverything you need to know about your galactic neighborhood.\nSolar System In Depth\nOur solar system is made up of a star, eight planets, and countless smaller bodies such as dwarf planets, asteroids, and comets.\nOur solar system orbits the center of the Milky Way galaxy at about 515,000 mph (828,000 kph). We\u2019re in one of the galaxy\u2019s four spiral arms.\nIt takes our solar system about 230 million years to complete one orbit around the galactic center.\nThere are three general kinds of galaxies: elliptical, spiral, and irregular. The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy.\nOur solar system is a region of space. It has no atmosphere. But it contains many worlds \u2013 including Earth \u2013 with many kinds of atmospheres.\nThe planets of our solar system \u2013 and even some asteroids \u2013 hold more than 200 moons in their orbits.\nThe four giant planets \u2013 and at least one asteroid \u2013 have rings. None are as spectacular as Saturn\u2019s gorgeous rings.\nMore than 300 robotic spacecraft have explored destinations beyond Earth's orbit,\u00a0including 24 American astronauts who made the trip from the Earth to the Moon.\nOur solar system is the only one known to support life. So far, we only know of life on Earth, but we\u2019re looking for more everywhere we can.\nNASA\u2019s Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 are the only spacecraft\u00a0to leave our solar system. Three\u00a0other spacecraft \u2013\u00a0Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11, and New Horizons\u00a0\u2013\u00a0will eventually hit interstellar space.\nFive spacecraft have achieved enough velocity to eventually travel beyond the boundaries of our solar system. Two of them reached the unexplored space between the stars after several decades in space.\nScience Writers: \nPhil Davis & Steve Carney\n\nSocial Media Lead: \nBill Dunford\n\nDesign & Development:

have a simple answer. Everyone knows that Earth, Mars and Jupiter are planets. But both Pluto and Ceres were once considered planets until new discoveries triggered scientific debate about how to best describe them\u2014a vigorous debate that continues to this day. The most recent definition of a planet was adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 2006. It says a planet must do three things:\nDiscussion\u2014and debate\u2014will continue as our view of the cosmos continues to expand.\nScience is a dynamic process of questioning, hypothesizing, discovering, and changing previous ideas based on what is learned. Scientific ideas are developed through reasoning and tested against observations. Scientists assess and question each other's work in a critical process called peer review.\nOur understanding about the universe and our place in it has changed over time. New information can cause us to rethink what we know and reevaluate how we classify objects in order to better understand them. New ideas and perspectives can come from questioning a theory or seeing where a classification breaks down.\nDefining the term planet is important, because such definitions reflect our understanding of the origins, architecture, and evolution of our solar system. Over historical time, objects categorized as planets have changed. The ancient Greeks counted the Earth's Moon and Sun as planets along with Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Earth was not considered a planet, but rather was thought to be the central object around which all the other celestial objects orbited. The first known model that placed the Sun at the center of the known universe with the Earth revolving around it was presented by Aristarchus of Samos in the third century BCE, but it was not generally accepted. It wasn't until the 16th century that the idea was revived by Nicolaus Copernicus.\nBy the 17th century, astronomers (aided by the invention of the telescope) realized that the Sun was the celestial object around which all the planets\u2014including Earth\u2014orbit, and that the moon is not a planet, but a satellite (moon) of Earth. Uranus was added as a planet in 1781 and Neptune was discovered in 1846.\nCeres was discovered between Mars and Jupiter in 1801 and originally classified as a planet. But as many more objects were subsequently found in the same region, it was realized that Ceres was the first of a class of similar objects that were eventually termed asteroids (star-like) or minor planets.\nPluto, discovered in 1930, was identified as the ninth planet. But Pluto is much smaller than Mercury and is even smaller than some of the planetary moons. It is unlike the terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars), or the gas giants (Jupiter, Saturn), or the ice giants (Uranus, Neptune). Charon, its huge satellite, is nearly half the size of Pluto and shares Pluto's orbit. Though Pluto kept its planetary status through the 1980s, things began to change in the 1990s with some new discoveries.\nTechnical advances in telescopes led to better observations and improved detection of very small, very distant objects. In the early 1990s, astronomers began finding numerous icy worlds orbiting the Sun in a doughnut-shaped region called the Kuiper Belt beyond the orbit of Neptune\u2014out in Pluto's realm. With the discovery of the Kuiper Belt and its thousands of icy bodies (known as Kuiper Belt Objects, or KBOs; also called transneptunians), it was proposed that it is more useful to think of Pluto as the biggest KBO instead of a planet.\nThen, in 2005, a team of astronomers announced that they had found a tenth planet\u2014it was a KBO similar in size to Pluto. People began to wonder what planethood really means. Just what is a planet, anyway? Suddenly the answer to that question didn't seem so self-evident, and, as it turns out, there are plenty of disagreements about it.\nThe International Astronomical Union (IAU), a worldwide organization of astronomers, took on the challenge of classifying the newly found KBO (later named Eris). In 2006, the IAU passed a resolution that defined planet and established a new category, dwarf planet. Eris, Ceres, Pluto, and two more recently discovered KBOs named Haumea and Makemake, are the dwarf planets recognized by the IAU. There may be another 100 dwarf planets in the solar system and hundreds more in and just outside the Kuiper Belt.\nHere is the text of the IAU\u2019s Resolution B5: Definition of a Planet in the Solar System:\nContemporary observations are changing our understanding of planetary systems, and it is important that our nomenclature for objects reflect our current understanding. This applies, in particular, to the designation \"planets\". The word \"planet\" originally described \"wanderers\" that were known only as moving lights in the sky. Recent discoveries lead us to create a new definition, which we can make using currently available scientific information.\nThe IAU therefore resolves that planets and other bodies, except satellites, in our Solar System be defined into three distinct categories in the following way:\nDebate\u2014and Discoveries\u2014Continue\nAstronomers and planetary scientists did not unanimously agree with these definitions. To some it appeared that the classification scheme was designed to limit the number of planets; to others it was incomplete and the terms unclear. Some astronomers argued that location (context) is important, especially in understanding the formation and evolution of the solar system.\nOne idea is to simply define a planet as a natural object in space that is massive enough for gravity to make it approximately spherical. But some scientists objected that this simple definition does not take into account what degree of measurable roundness is needed for an object to be considered round. In fact, it is often difficult to accurately determine the shapes of some distant objects. Others argue that where an object is located or what it is made of do matter and there should not be a concern with dynamics; that is, whether or not an object sweeps up or scatters away its immediate neighbors, or holds them in stable orbits. The lively planethood debate continues.\nAs our knowledge deepens and expands, the more complex and intriguing the universe appears. Researchers have found hundreds of extrasolar planets, or exoplanets, that reside outside our solar system; there may be billions of exoplanets in the Milky Way Galaxy alone, and some may be habitable (have conditions favorable to life). Whether our definitions of planet can be applied to these newly found objects remains to be seen.\nScience Writers: \nPhil Davis & Steve Carney\n\nSocial Media Lead: \nBill Dunford\n\nDesign &
