Practice vocabulary, use the most important verb conjugations in all the different tenses, and drill all major grammar topics with our entertaining online exercises.\nThe German language is the first language of over 100 million people who primarily live in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. These countries are highly developed and economically strong, thus making them attractive locations for work and living.\nMany workers come from distressed nations looking to join these active workforces, and since Germanic nations are the international headquarters for many scientific and technological powerhouses, they attract many highly-educated foreign workers.\nEven if you aren't planning on packing up and moving to Germany, many international companies work closely with German speakers, and many Germanic companies are international commerce and production leaders.\nThe Germans used to say, \"German language, difficult language,\" and there is some truth to that. Mastering the grammar requires a lot of effort, time, patience and most importantly, practice. Some of the topics that create problems for English speakers are the four different cases, the three noun genders, the distinct verb forms according to person and tense, and sentence construction.\nOn the other hand, German and English are more similar than most people think. As Germanic languages, they are closely related. Because of this, you will understand German words and texts quite quickly. If you want to test this theory, take a look at the vocabulary of a Slavic language. As a beginner, you may not recognize a single word.\nAs you can see, learning German is a valuable way to connect with our world and improve yourself. Although there are challenges, our program will help you overcome them through entertaining and enjoyable practice sessions.
