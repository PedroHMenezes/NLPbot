{"Netflix - Wikipedia": {"text": "Netflix, Inc. is an American media company based in Los Gatos, California. Founded in 1997 by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph in Scotts Valley, California, it operates the over-the-top subscription video on-demand service Netflix brand, which includes original films and television series commissioned or acquired by the company, and third-party content licensed from other distributors. Netflix is a member of the Motion Picture Association\u2014having become the first streaming company to become a member.\nNetflix initially both sold and rented DVDs by mail, but the sales were eliminated within a year to focus on the DVD rental business.[13][14] In 2007, Netflix introduced streaming media and video on demand. The company expanded to Canada in 2010, followed by Latin America and the Caribbean. In 2011, the service began to acquire and produce original content, beginning with the political drama House of Cards. By 2022, original productions accounted for half of Netflix's library in the United States, and the company had ventured into other categories, such as video game publishing via the Netflix service.\nThe company is ranked 115th on the Fortune 500[15] and 219th on the Forbes Global 2000.[16] It is the second largest entertainment/media company by market capitalization as of February\u00a02022[update].[17] In 2021, Netflix was ranked as the eighth-most trusted brand globally by Morning Consult.[18] During the 2010s, Netflix was the top-performing stock in the S&P 500 stock market index, with a total return of 3,693%.[19][20] As of January\u00a02023[update], Netflix had over 230 million subscribers worldwide, including 74.3 million in the United States and Canada; 76.7 million in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, 41.7 million in Latin America and 38 million in the Asia-Pacific region.[12] The Netflix service is available worldwide aside from Mainland China, Syria, North Korea, and Russia.\nNetflix is headquartered in Los Gatos, California, in Santa Clara County,[21][22] with the two CEOs, Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos, split between Los Gatos and Los Angeles, respectively.[23][24][25] It also operates international offices in Asia, Europe and Latin America including in Canada, France, Brazil, the Netherlands, India, Italy, Japan, Poland, South Korea and the United Kingdom. The company has production hubs in Los Angeles,[26] Albuquerque,[27] London,[28] Madrid, Vancouver and Toronto.[29]\nNetflix was founded by Marc Randolph and Reed Hastings on August 29, 1997, in Scotts Valley, California. Hastings, a computer scientist and mathematician, was a cofounder of Pure Atria, which was acquired by Rational Software Corporation that year for $750\u00a0million, the then biggest acquisition in Silicon Valley history.[30] Randolph had worked as a marketing director for Pure Atria after Pure Atria acquired a company where Randolph worked. He was previously a co-founder of MicroWarehouse, a computer mail-order company as well as vice president of marketing for Borland International.[31][32] Hastings and Randolph came up with the idea for Netflix while carpooling between their homes in Santa Cruz, California, and Pure Atria's headquarters in Sunnyvale.[14] Patty McCord, later head of human resources at Netflix, was also in the carpool group.[33] Randolph admired Amazon.com and wanted to find a large category of portable items to sell over the Internet using a similar model. Hastings and Randolph considered and rejected selling and renting VHS tapes as too expensive to stock and too delicate to ship.[31] When they heard about DVDs, first introduced in the United States in early 1997, they tested the concept of selling or renting DVDs by mail by mailing a compact disc to Hastings's house in Santa Cruz.[31] When the disc arrived intact, they decided to enter the $16\u00a0billion home-video sales and rental industry.[31][14] Hastings is often quoted saying that he decided to start Netflix after being fined $40 at a Blockbuster store for being late to return a copy of Apollo 13, a claim since repudiated by Randolph.[14] Hastings invested $2.5\u00a0million into Netflix from the sale of Pure Atria.[34][14] Netflix launched as the first DVD rental and sales website with 30 employees and 925 titles available\u2014nearly all DVDs published.[14][35][36] Randolph and Hastings met with Jeff Bezos, where Amazon offered to acquire Netflix for between $14 and $16 million. Fearing competition from Amazon, Randolph at first thought the offer was fair, but Hastings, who owned 70% of the company, turned it down on the plane ride home.[37][38]\nInitially, Netflix offered a per-rental model for each DVD but introduced a monthly subscription concept in September 1999.[39] The per-rental model was dropped by early 2000, allowing the company to focus on the business model of flat-fee unlimited rentals without due dates, late fees, shipping and handling fees, or per-title rental fees.[40] In September 2000, during the dot-com bubble, while Netflix was suffering losses, Hastings and Randolph offered to sell the company to Blockbuster LLC for $50 million. John Antioco, CEO of Blockbuster, thought the offer was a joke and declined, saying, \"The dot-com hysteria is completely overblown.\"[41][42] While Netflix experienced fast growth in early 2001, the continued effects of the dot-com bubble collapse and the September 11 attacks caused the company to hold off plans for its initial public offering (IPO) and to lay off one-third of its 120 employees.[43]\nDVD players were a popular gift for holiday sales in late 2001, and demand for DVD subscription services were \"growing like crazy\", according to chief talent officer Patty McCord.[44] The company went public on May 29, 2002, selling 5.5\u00a0million shares of common stock at US$15.00 per share.[45] In 2003, Netflix was issued a patent by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office to cover its subscription rental service and several extensions.[46] Netflix posted its first profit in 2003, earning $6.5 million on revenues of $272 million; by 2004, profit had increased to $49 million on over $500 million in revenues.[47] In 2005, 35,000 different films were available, and Netflix shipped 1\u00a0million DVDs out every day.[48]\nIn 2004, Blockbuster introduced a DVD rental service, which not only allowed users to check out titles through online sites but allowed for them to return them at brick-and-mortar stores.[49] By 2006, Blockbuster's service reached two million users, and while trailing Netflix's subscriber count, was drawing business away from Netflix. Netflix lowered fees in 2007.[47] While it was an urban legend that Netflix ultimately \"killed\" Blockbuster in the DVD rental market, Blockbuster's debt load and internal disagreements hurt the company.[49]\nOn April 4, 2006, Netflix filed a patent infringement lawsuit in which it demanded a jury trial in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that Blockbuster LLC's online DVD rental subscription program violated two patents held by Netflix. The first cause of action alleged Blockbuster's infringement of copying the \"dynamic queue\" of DVDs available for each customer, Netflix's method of using the ranked preferences in the queue to send DVDs to subscribers, and Netflix's method permitting the queue to be updated and reordered.[50] The second cause of action alleged infringement of the subscription rental service as well as Netflix's methods of communication and delivery.[51] The companies settled their dispute on June 25, 2007; terms were not disclosed.[52][53][54][55]\nOn October 1, 2006, Netflix announced the Netflix Prize, $1,000,000 to the first developer of a video-recommendation algorithm that could beat its existing algorithm Cinematch, at predicting customer ratings by more than 10%. On September 21, 2009, it awarded the $1,000,000 prize to team \"BellKor's Pragmatic Chaos.\"[56] Cinematch, launched in 2000, is a recommendation system that recommended movies to its users, many of which they might not ever had heard of before.[57][58]\nThrough its division Red Envelope Entertainment, Netflix licensed and distributed independent films such as Born into Brothels and Sherrybaby. In late 2006, Red Envelope Entertainment also expanded into producing original content with filmmakers such as John Waters.[59] Netflix closed Red Envelope Entertainment in 2008.[60][61]\nIn January 2007, the company launched a streaming media service, introducing video on demand via the Internet. However, at that time it only had 1,000 films available for streaming, compared to 70,000 available on DVD.[62] The company had for some time considered offering movies online, but it was only in the mid-2000s that data speeds and bandwidth costs had improved sufficiently to allow customers to download movies from the net. The original idea was a \"Netflix box\" that could download movies overnight, and be ready to watch the next day. By 2005, Netflix had acquired movie rights and designed the box and service. But after witnessing how popular streaming services such as YouTube were despite the lack of high-definition content, the concept of using a hardware device was scrapped and replaced with a streaming concept.[63]\nIn February 2007, Netflix delivered its billionth DVD, a copy of Babel to a customer in Texas.[64][65] In April 2007, Netflix recruited ReplayTV founder Anthony Wood, to build a \"Netflix Player\" that would allow streaming content to be played directly on a television rather than a desktop or laptop.[66] Hastings eventually shut down the project to help encourage other hardware manufacturers to include built-in Netflix support, which would be spun off as the digital media player product Roku.[67][68][69]\nIn January 2008, all rental-disc subscribers became entitled to unlimited streaming at no additional cost. This change came in a response to the introduction of Hulu and to Apple's new video-rental services.[70][71][page\u00a0needed] In August 2008, the Netflix database was corrupted and the company was not able to ship DVDs to customers for 3 days, leading the company to move all its data to the Amazon Web Services cloud.[72] In November 2008, Netflix began offering subscribers rentals on Blu-ray and discontinued its sale of used DVDs.[73] In 2009, Netflix streams overtook DVD shipments.[74]\nOn January 6, 2010, Netflix agreed with Warner Bros. to delay new release rentals 28 days prior to retail, in an attempt to help studios sell physical copies, and similar deals involving Universal Pictures and 20th Century Fox were reached on April 9.[75][76][77] In July 2010, Netflix signed a deal to stream movies of Relativity Media.[78] In August 2010, Netflix reached a five-year deal worth nearly $1\u00a0billion to stream films from Paramount, Lionsgate and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The deal increased Netflix's annual spending fees, adding roughly $200\u00a0million per year. It spent $117\u00a0million in the first six months of 2010 on streaming, up from $31\u00a0million in 2009.[79] On September 22, 2010, Netflix launched in Canada, its first international market.[80][81] In November 2010, Netflix began offering a standalone streaming service separate from DVD rentals.[82]\nIn 2010, Netflix acquired the rights to Breaking Bad, produced by Sony Pictures Television, after the show's third season, at a point where original broadcaster AMC had expressed the possibility of cancelling the show. Sony pushed Netflix to release Breaking Bad in time for the fourth season, which as a result, greatly expanded the show's audience on AMC due to new viewers binging on the Netflix past episodes, and doubling the viewership by the time of the fifth season. Breaking Bad is considered the first such show to have this \"Netflix effect.\"[83]\nIn January 2011, Netflix announced agreements with several manufacturers to include branded Netflix buttons on the remote controls of devices compatible with the service, such as Blu-ray players.[84] By May 2011, Netflix had become the largest source of Internet streaming traffic in North America, accounting for 30% of traffic during peak hours.[85][86][87][88]\nOn July 12, 2011, Netflix announced that it would separate its existing subscription plans into two separate plans: one covering the streaming and the other DVD rental services.[89][90] The cost for streaming would be $7.99 per month, while DVD rental would start at the same price.[91] In September 2011, Netflix announced a content deal with DreamWorks Animation.[92] In September 2011, Netflix expanded to 43 countries in Latin America.[93][94][95] On September 18, 2011, Netflix announced its intentions to rebrand and restructure its DVD home media rental service as an independent subsidiary called Qwikster, separating DVD rental and streaming services.[96][97][98][99][100] On October 10, 2011, Netflix announced that it would retain its DVD service under the name Netflix and that its streaming and DVD-rental plans would remain branded together.[101][102]\nOn January 4, 2012, Netflix started its expansion to Europe, launching in the United Kingdom and Ireland.[103] In February 2012, Netflix reached a multi-year agreement with The Weinstein Company.[104][105] In March 2012, Netflix acquired the domain name DVD.com.[106] By 2016, Netflix rebranded its DVD-by-mail service under the name DVD.com, A Netflix Company.[107][108] In April 2012, Netflix filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to form a political action committee (PAC) called FLIXPAC.[109] Netflix spokesperson Joris Evers tweeted that the intent was to \"engage on issues like net neutrality, bandwidth caps, UBB and VPPA\".[110][111] In June 2012, Netflix signed a deal with Open Road Films.[112][113]\nOn August 23, 2012, Netflix and The Weinstein Company signed a multi-year output deal for RADiUS-TWC films.[114][115] In September 2012, Epix signed a five-year streaming deal with Netflix. For the initial two years of this agreement, first-run and back-catalog content from Epix was exclusive to Netflix. Epix films came to Netflix 90 days after premiering on Epix.[116] These included films from Paramount, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Lionsgate.[117][118]\nOn October 18, 2012, Netflix launched in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden.[119][120] On December 4, 2012, Netflix and Disney announced an exclusive multi-year agreement for first-run United States subscription television rights to Walt Disney Studios' animated and live-action films, with classics such as Dumbo, Alice in Wonderland and Pocahontas available immediately and others available on Netflix beginning in 2016.[121] Direct-to-video releases were made available in 2013.[122][123]\nOn January 14, 2013, Netflix signed an agreement with Time Warner's Turner Broadcasting System and Warner Bros. Television to distribute Cartoon Network, Warner Bros. Animation, and Adult Swim content, as well as TNT's Dallas, beginning in March 2013. The rights to these programs were given to Netflix shortly after deals with Viacom to stream Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. Channel programs expired.[124]\nFor cost reasons, Netflix stated that it would limit its expansion in 2013,[125] adding only one new market\u2014the Netherlands\u2014in September of that year. This expanded its availability to 40 territories.[126][127]\nNetflix began efforts to develop original content in 2011; in March, Netflix made a straight-to-series order for the Kevin Spacey-led political drama House of Cards from MRC. Beating out other U.S. cable networks, it marked the first first-run television series to be specifically commissioned by the service.[128] In November 2011, Netflix then ordered Orange is the New Black, a comedy-drama adapted from Piper Kerman's memoir of the same name,[129] and a new season of the cancelled Fox sitcom Arrested Development.[130] Netflix also acquired U.S. rights to the Norwegian drama Lilyhammer; following its television premiere on Norway's NRK1 on January 25, 2012, the entirety of its first season was released by Netflix on February 8\u2014a notable departure from the broadcast television model of premiering episodes on a weekly basis.[131][132]\nHouse of Cards was released by Netflix on February 1, 2013, marketed as the first \"Netflix Original\" production.[133] Later that month, Netflix announced an agreement with DreamWorks Animation to commission children's television series based on its properties, beginning with Turbo: F.A.S.T., a spin-off of its film Turbo.[134][135] Orange is the New Black would premiere in July 2013;  Netflix stated that Orange is the New Black had been its most-watched original series so far, with all of them having \"an audience comparable with successful shows on cable and broadcast TV.\"[136][137]\nOn March 13, 2013, Netflix added a Facebook sharing feature, letting United States subscribers access \"Watched by your friends\" and \"Friends' Favorites\" by agreeing.[138] This was not legal until the Video Privacy Protection Act was modified in early 2013.[139] On August 1, 2013, Netflix reintroduced the \"Profiles\" feature that permits accounts to accommodate up to five user profiles.[140][141][142][143]\nIn November 2013, Marvel Television and ABC Studios announced Netflix had ordered a slate of four television series based on the Marvel Comics characters Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist and Luke Cage. Each of the four series received an initial order of 13 episodes, and Netflix also ordered a Defenders miniseries that would tie them together.

As Netflix increased its streaming output, it has faced calls to limit accessibility to graphic content and include viewer advisories for issues such as sensationalism and promotion of pseudoscience. Netflix's content has also been criticized by disability rights advocates for lack of captioning quality.[448]\nSome media organizations and competitors have criticized Netflix for selectively releasing ratings and viewer numbers of its original programming. The company has made claims boasting about viewership records without providing data to substantiate its successes or using problematic estimation methods.[449] In March 2020, some government agencies called for Netflix and other streamers to limit services due to increased broadband and energy consumption as use of the platform increased. In response, the company announced it would reduce bit rates across all streams in Europe, thus decreasing Netflix traffic on European networks by around 25 percent. These same steps were later taken in India.[citation needed]\nIn May 2022, Netflix's shareholder Imperium Irrevocable Trust filed a lawsuit against the company for violating the U.S. securities laws.[450]\nIn March 2023, Mithun Vijay Kumar, a political activist in India sued Netflix India for streaming an episode of sitcom The Big Bang Theory in which a character played by Kunal Nayyar allegedly call actress Madhuri Dixit \"a leprous prostitute.\" Many people online trolled Netflix for streaming the episode containing insulting dialogue. Kumar expressed that online streaming platform like Netflix should hold accountable for their actions.[451][452]", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix#cite_note-62", "

Wikipedia": {"text": "The Naver Corporation is a South Korean internet conglomerate headquartered in Seongnam that operates the search engine Naver. Naver established itself as an early pioneer in the use of user-generated content through the creation of the online Q&A platform Knowledge iN. Naver also manages the video messenger SNOW, and group communication service BAND.\nOn August 1, 2013, Naver decided to split with Hangame, a corporation which it had grown together with as NHN Corporation for 13 years.[4] On October 1, 2013, the company adopted its current name Naver Corporation in order to reflect the change, restoring its pre-merger name. Hangame is now overseen by NHN Entertainment Corporation. Naver's current affiliates include Line Corporation, Snow, Naver Labs, Naver Webtoon, NAVER Cloud, and Works Mobile. The company is currently cooperating with IT startups in order to evolve into a tech-based platform.\nNaver Corporation was first established in June 1999 under the name of Naver Comm. Along with its search engine Naver, the company also launched a service for children named Junior Naver. In July 2000, Naver merged with Hangame Communications Inc. and several other companies including Oneque and Search Solutions.\nIn August 2000, Naver began its 'comprehensive search' service, which allows users to get a variety of results from a search query on a single page, organized by type (for example blogs, webpages, images, cafes, etc.). In September 2000, Naver established Hangame Japan.\nIn 2001, NAVER Comm was renamed NHN Corporation (Next Human Network), although both divisions\u2014Naver and Hangame\u2014continued to operate under their original brand names. NHN also stood for (NAVER, Hangame, Network).\nIn 2002, NHN was registered on the KOSDAQ stock exchange, and launched the online Q&A service Naver Knowledge iN. In 2003, NHN merged all Japanese subsidiaries into NHN Japan. In 2005, Naver began the online donation service: Happy Bean. It also established its US branch under the name NHN USA. In 2007, it launched Naver Japan in order to pursue its search engine business in Japan. Meanwhile, NHN USA officially opened its American game service, ijji. However, it later sold away its 100% stake to Aeria Games.[5]\nIn 2008, NHN appeared on the Forbes Global 2000 list for the first time. That same year, NHN had the largest market capitalization among KOSDAQ-listed companies before being transferred to the KOSPI market in November. In 2009, Kim Sang-Hun of NHN and Jing-Wan Kim of Samsung were the only South Korean CEOs to appear on Forbes' Asia's Fab 50 list.\nIn 2010 NHN bought Livedoor, a Japanese ISP and blog platform. In the same year, the company moved into its new headquarters now known as the Green Factory.\nIn June 2011, NHN Japan launched Line, a messaging application that quickly soared in usage. In 2012, NHN announced that it planned to invest \u20a91.5 billion (equivalent to \u20a91.59 billion or US$1.41 million in 2017)[6] in developing ten social media games. In the same year, NHN Japan, Naver Japan and Livedoor were all merged into one company: NHN Japan. In August, NHN also established its Singapore branch NHN Singapore.[citation needed]\nIn 2013, NHN launched its subsidiary companies Camp Mobile and Line Plus. NHN was split into Naver Corporation and NHN Entertainment, the latter being formerly known as Hangame. Similarly, NHN Japan separated into Line Corporation (web services) and Hangame Japan (game services). In June, Naver became the first web company in Korea to build and operate its own data center, Data Center GAK, which was built in Chuncheon, Gangwon Province.[7]\nIn 2015, Naver launched Works Mobile for B2B collaboration businesses and merged with Entry Education Labs, which is a software education platform company. In the same year, global revenues began exceeding \u20a91 trillion (equivalent to \u20a91.03 trillion or US$910.54 million in 2017)[6] due to the growth of global affiliate services such as LINE.\nNaver's annual revenue for 2016 was 4.02 trillion won.[8] In 2016, Line Corporation was double listed on both the NYSE and the TSE. In August 2016, Naver spun off its app SNOW into a separate subsidiary company, Snow Corp.[9][10] Naver also began Project Flower, a project which aims to support small businesses and creators by cooperating with them on various projects. In September 2016, Naver and its affiliate Line announced that they would invest a combined 100 million euros (US$112 million) into K-Fund 1.

(company) - Wikipedia": {"text": "Hello Sunshine is an American media company founded by actress Reese Witherspoon and Strand Equity Founder and Managing Partner Seth Rodsky in 2016. Pacific Standard, the production company Witherspoon co-founded with Bruna Papandrea in 2012, is now a subsidiary of Hello Sunshine.[1]\nOn July 10, 2018, its co-owner AT&T through its communications division announced the launch of a Hello Sunshine-branded cable and satellite television channel, Hello Sunshine Channel, which will be focused on women similarly to the Oprah Winfrey Network.[2][3][4][5]\nIn 2000, Witherspoon founded production company Type A Films, which she merged with Bruna Papandrea's Make Movies banner to create a new production company entitled Pacific Standard in 2012.[6] Together, they produced the Oscar-nominated films Gone Girl and Wild, and the HBO drama series Big Little Lies. In 2016, Witherspoon and Papandrea split up, with Witherspoon gaining full control over the company.[7]\nIn November 2016, Witherspoon, Seth Rodsky and Otter Media formed Hello Sunshine with Sarah Harden, a joint venture focused on telling female-driven stories on film, TV and digital platforms. Pacific Standard has become a subsidiary of the newer company.[1] The company's CEO is media and tech industry executive Kerry Tucker.[8]\nIn addition to producing content, Hello Sunshine also curates a book club called Reese's Book Club x Hello Sunshine.[9] Witherspoon announces a new book pick every month on her Instagram and the book club is aimed to bring women's stories forward. The book club has over 500,000 followers on Instagram, and more than 70,000 followers on Facebook. Hello Sunshine also had a Filmmaker Lab to teach 20 girls aged 13\u201318 the art of film making.[10]\nOn social media platforms Facebook Watch and IGTV, Hello Sunshine has released three short-form unscripted series focussing on female successes. In April 2018, Hello Sunshine launched the podcast How It Is, hosted by American actress Diane Guerrero.[11] A second season of the podcast launched in October 2018.[12] In November 2018, the third season of How It Is premiered with Kelly McCreary taking over as host.[13]\nIn July 2018, Hello Sunshine launched the talk show Shine On with Reese on DirecTV hosted by Witherspoon in her first unscripted series. The show presents one-on-one interviews between Witherspoon and various female guests focussing on how they achieved their dreams.\nIn October 2018, Hello Sunshine launched a new podcast titled My Best Break-Up which is hosted by Irish comedian Maeve Higgins.[14]\nIn November 2018, Hello Sunshine partnered with Together Live to create the tour Hello Sunshine x Together Live. The tour went to ten different cities across the United States and featured multiple guest speakers telling their story including Halima Aden, MILCK, Yara Shahidi, Uma Thurman, Nicole Byer, Cameron Esposito, Sonequa Martin-Green and Sophia Bush. Highlights from the tour will be featured in the third forthcoming podcast And Especially You which will be hosted by guest speaker Sophia Bush.[15]\nIn February 2019, Hello Sunshine received an investment from Laurene Powell Jobs' Emerson Collective. Otter Media has also increased its stake in the company.[16]\nIn early August 2021, Witherspoon (after considering selling the company and hearing the interest of Apple[17]) sold part of the company to a Blackstone backed media company, Candle Media, led by former Disney executives Kevin A. Mayer and Tom Staggs for $900 million.[18] The transaction resulted in Witherspoon and Harden retaining a stake in the new company and a seat on the board.[19] Hello Sunshine shut down its kids and animation unit in February 2023, with the company expected to work with fellow Candle Media subsidiary Moonbug Entertainment moving forward.[20]\nWitherspoon and Bruna Papandrea will continue to produce the projects they have in development together including Luckiest Girl Alive at Lionsgate/Summit, All Is Not Forgotten at Warner Bros, and Ashley's War at Fox 2000. They also will continue to work together under Pacific Standard's overall deal at ABC.[7]\nIn May 2017, it was reported Hello Sunshine has set up to produce two novels, Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine by Gail Honeyman and Something in the Water by Catherine Steadman.[21] Furthermore, it was announced that Hello Sunshine was filming a documentary about Martina Navratilova, one of the best tennis players of all time.[22]\nHello Sunshine has acquired film rights to the novel The Gilded Years. Zendaya has signed to star in the adaptation which will be called A White Lie and Witherspoon will star and produce Legally Blonde 3 which was scheduled to premiere on Valentine's Day 2020,[23][24] but has since been delayed indefinitely.[25] In November 2018, it was announced that Hello Sunshine will produce the novel League of Wives as a feature film with Fox 2000 but due to the dissolution of Fox 2000 following the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney, the fate of the project is unknown as of February 2020.[26]\nAs of February 2020, Hello Sunshine has six television series in development at six different networks including Apple TV+, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, ABC, Starz and Netflix.[27][28][29][30][31][32][33] Witherspoon will star in one show and will serve as an executive producer on all six shows.\nIn March 2022, it was announced that Hello Sunshine would produce Run, Rose, Run, a film adaptation of a novel written by Dolly Parton and James Patterson. Parton will also star in the film.[34][35]\nIn August 2022, the company opened in Unscripted division in the United Kingdom.[36]", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_Sunshine_(company)", "

Wikipedia": {"text": "Serbian (\u0441\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0438 / srpski, pronounced\u00a0[sr\u0329\u0302pski\u02d0]) is the standardized variety of the Serbo-Croatian language mainly used by Serbs.[8][9][10][11][12] It is the official and national language of Serbia, one of the three official languages of Bosnia and Herzegovina and co-official in Montenegro and Kosovo.[a]  It is a recognized minority language in Croatia, North Macedonia, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic.\nStandard Serbian is based on the most widespread dialect of Serbo-Croatian, Shtokavian (more specifically on the dialects of \u0160umadija-Vojvodina and Eastern Herzegovina[13]), which is also the basis of standard Croatian, Bosnian, and Montenegrin varieties[14] and therefore the Declaration on the Common Language of Croats, Bosniaks, Serbs, and Montenegrins was issued in 2017.[15][16] The other dialect spoken by Serbs is Torlakian in southeastern Serbia, which is transitional to Macedonian and Bulgarian.\nSerbian is practically the only European standard language whose speakers are fully functionally digraphic,[17] using both Cyrillic and Latin alphabets. The Serbian Cyrillic alphabet was devised in 1814 by Serbian linguist Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107, who created it based on phonemic principles. The Latin alphabet used for Serbian (latinica) was designed by the Croatian linguist Ljudevit Gaj in the 1830s based on the Czech system with a one-to-one grapheme-phoneme correlation between the Cyrillic and Latin orthographies, resulting in a parallel system.[18]\nSerbian is a standardized variety of Serbo-Croatian,[19][20] a Slavic language (Indo-European), of the South Slavic subgroup. Other standardized forms of Serbo-Croatian are Bosnian, Croatian, and Montenegrin. \"An examination of all the major 'levels' of language shows that BCS is clearly a single language with a single grammatical system.\"[21] It has lower intelligibility with the Eastern South Slavic languages Bulgarian and Macedonian, than with Slovene (Slovene is part of the Western South Slavic subgroup, but there are still significant differences in vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation to the standardized forms of Serbo-Croatian, although it is closer to the Kajkavian and Chakavian dialects of Serbo-Croatian[22]).\nFigures of speakers according to countries:\nSerbian was the official language of Montenegro until October 2007 when the new Constitution of Montenegro replaced the Constitution of 1992. Amid opposition from pro-Serbian parties,[31] Montenegrin was made the sole official language of the country, and Serbian was given the status of a language in official use along with Bosnian, Albanian, and Croatian.[32]\nIn the 2011 Montenegrin census, 42.88% declared Serbian to be their native language, while Montenegrin was declared by 36.97% of the population.[33]\nStandard Serbian language uses both Cyrillic (\u045b\u0438\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0430, \u0107irilica) and Latin script (latinica, \u043b\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430). Serbian is a rare example of synchronic digraphia, a situation where all literate members of a society have two interchangeable writing systems available to them. Media and publishers typically select one alphabet or the other. In general, the alphabets are used interchangeably; except in the legal sphere, where Cyrillic is required, there is no context where one alphabet or another predominates.\nAlthough Serbian language authorities have recognized the official status of both scripts in contemporary Standard Serbian for more than half of a century now, due to historical reasons, the Cyrillic script was made the official script of Serbia's administration by the 2006 Constitution.[34]\nThe Latin script continues to be used in official contexts, although the government has indicated its desire to phase out this practice due to national sentiment. The Ministry of Culture believes that Cyrillic is the \"identity script\" of the Serbian nation.[35]\nHowever, the law does not regulate scripts in standard language, or standard language itself by any means, leaving the choice of script as a matter of personal preference and to the free will in all aspects of life (publishing, media, trade and commerce, etc.), except in government paperwork production and in official written communication with state officials, which have to be in Cyrillic.[34]\nTo most Serbians, the Latin script tends to imply a cosmopolitan or neutral attitude, while Cyrillic appeals to a more traditional or vintage sensibility.[36]\nIn media, the public broadcaster, Radio Television of Serbia, predominantly uses the Cyrillic script whereas the privately run broadcasters, like RTV Pink, predominantly use the Latin script. Newspapers can be found in both scripts.\nIn the public sphere, with logos, outdoor signage and retail packaging, the Latin script predominates, although both scripts are commonly seen. The Serbian government has encouraged increasing the use of Cyrillic in these contexts.[36] Larger signs, especially those put up by the government, will often feature both alphabets; if the sign has English on it, then usually only Cyrillic is used for the Serbian text.\nA survey from 2014 showed that 47% of the Serbian population favors the Latin alphabet whereas 36% favors the Cyrillic one.[37]\nLatin script has become more and more popular in Serbia, as it is easier to input on phones and computers.[38]\nThe sort order of the \u0107irilica (\u045b\u0438\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0430) alphabet:\nThe sort order of the latinica (\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430) alphabet:\nSerbian is a highly inflected language, with grammatical morphology for nouns, pronouns and adjectives as well as verbs.[39]\nSerbian nouns are classified into three declensional types, denoted largely by their nominative case endings as \"-a\" type, \"-i\" and \"-e\" type. Into each of these declensional types may fall nouns of any of three genders: masculine, feminine or neuter. Each noun may be inflected to represent the noun's grammatical case, of which Serbian has seven:\nNouns are further inflected to represent the noun's number, singular or plural.\nPronouns, when used, are inflected along the same case and number morphology as nouns. Serbian is a pro-drop language, meaning that pronouns may be omitted from a sentence when their meaning is easily inferred from the text. In cases where pronouns may be dropped, they may also be used to add emphasis. For example:\nAdjectives in Serbian may be placed before or after the noun they modify, but must agree in number, gender and case with the modified noun.\nSerbian verbs are conjugated in four past forms\u2014perfect, aorist, imperfect, and pluperfect\u2014of which the last two have a very limited use (imperfect is still used in some dialects, but the majority of native Serbian speakers consider it archaic), one future tense (also known as the first future tense, as opposed to the second future tense or the future exact, which is considered a tense of the conditional mood by some contemporary linguists), and one present tense. These are the tenses of the indicative mood. Apart from the indicative mood, there is also the imperative mood. The conditional mood has two more tenses: the first conditional (commonly used in conditional clauses, both for possible and impossible conditional clauses) and the second conditional (without use in the spoken language\u2014it should be used for impossible conditional clauses). Serbian has active and passive voice.\nAs for the non-finite verb forms, Serbian has one infinitive, two adjectival participles (the active and the passive), and two adverbial participles (the present and the past).\nMost Serbian words are of native Slavic lexical stock, tracing back to the Proto-Slavic language. There are many loanwords from different languages, reflecting cultural interaction throughout history. Notable loanwords were borrowed from Greek, Latin, Italian, Turkish, Hungarian, English, Russian, German, Czech and French.\nSerbian literature emerged in the Middle Ages, and included such works as Miroslavljevo jevan\u0111elje (Miroslav's Gospel) in 1186 and Du\u0161anov zakonik (Du\u0161an's Code) in 1349. Little secular medieval literature has been preserved, but what there is shows that it was in accord with its time; for example, the Serbian Alexandride, a book about Alexander the Great, and a translation of Tristan and Iseult into Serbian. Although not belonging to the literature proper, the corpus of Serbian literacy in the 14th and 15th centuries contains numerous legal, commercial and administrative texts with marked presence of Serbian vernacular juxtaposed on the matrix of Serbian Church Slavonic.\nBy the beginning of the 14th century the Serbo-Croatian language, which was so rigorously proscribed by earlier local laws, becomes the dominant language of the Republic of Ragusa.[40] However, despite her wealthy citizens speaking the Serbo-Croatian dialect of Dubrovnik in their family circles, they sent their children to Florentine schools to become perfectly fluent in Italian.[40] Since the beginning of the 13th century, the entire official correspondence of Dubrovnik with states in the hinterland was conducted in Serbian.[41]\nIn the mid-15th century, Serbia was conquered by the Ottoman Empire and for the next 400 years there was no opportunity for the creation of secular written literature. However, some of the greatest literary works in Serbian come from this time, in the form of oral literature, the most notable form being epic poetry. The epic poems were mainly written down in the 19th century, and preserved in oral tradition up to the 1950s, a few centuries or even a millennium longer than by most other \"epic folks\". Goethe and Jacob Grimm learned Serbian in order to read Serbian epic poetry in the original. By the end of the 18th century, the written literature had become estranged from the spoken language. In the second half of the 18th century, the new language appeared, called Slavonic-Serbian. This artificial idiom superseded the works of poets and historians like Gavrilo Stefanovi\u0107 Venclovi\u0107, who wrote in essentially modern Serbian in the 1720s. These vernacular compositions have remained cloistered from the general public and received due attention only with the advent of modern literary historians and writers like Milorad Pavi\u0107. In the early 19th century, Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107 promoted the spoken language of the people as a literary norm.\nThe dialects of Serbo-Croatian, regarded Serbian (traditionally spoken in Serbia), include:\nVuk Karad\u017ei\u0107's Srpski rje\u010dnik, first published in 1818, is the earliest dictionary of modern literary Serbian. The Rje\u010dnik hrvatskoga ili srpskoga jezika (I\u2013XXIII), published by the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts from 1880 to 1976, is the only general historical dictionary of Serbo-Croatian. Its first editor was \u0110uro Dani\u010di\u0107, followed by Pero Budmani and the famous Vukovian Tomislav Mareti\u0107. The sources of this dictionary are, especially in the first volumes, mainly \u0160tokavian. There are older, pre-standard dictionaries, such as the 1791 German\u2013Serbian dictionary or 15th century Arabic-Persian-Greek-Serbian Conversation Textbook.\nThe standard and the only completed etymological dictionary of Serbian is the \"Skok\", written by the Croatian linguist Petar Skok: Etimologijski rje\u010dnik hrvatskoga ili srpskoga jezika (\"Etymological Dictionary of Croatian or Serbian\"). I-IV. Zagreb 1971\u20131974.\nThere is also a new monumental Etimolo\u0161ki re\u010dnik srpskog jezika (Etymological Dictionary of Serbian). So far, two volumes have been published: I (with words on A-), and II (Ba-Bd).\nThere are specialized etymological dictionaries for German, Italian, Croatian, Turkish, Greek, Hungarian, Russian, English and other loanwords (cf. chapter word origin).\nArticle 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Serbian, written in the Cyrillic script:[42]\n\u0421\u0432\u0430 \u0459\u0443\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0431\u0438\u045b\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0452\u0430\u0458\u0443 \u0441\u0435 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u0438 \u0458\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u0443 \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0458\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043c\u0430. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0443 \u043e\u0431\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0443\u043c\u043e\u043c \u0438 \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0448\u045b\u0443 \u0438 \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0430 \u0458\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0438\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0458\u0443 \u0443 \u0434\u0443\u0445\u0443 \u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430.\nArticle 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Serbian, written in the Latin alphabet:[43]\nSva ljudska bi\u0107a ra\u0111aju se slobodna i jednaka u dostojanstvu i pravima.

{"text": "iOS (formerly iPhone OS[10]) is a mobile operating system developed by Apple Inc. exclusively for its hardware. It is the operating system that powers many of the company's mobile devices, including the iPhone; the term also includes the system software for iPads predating  iPadOS\u2014which was introduced in 2019\u2014as well as on the iPod Touch devices\u2014which were discontinued in mid-2022.[11] It is the world's second-most widely installed mobile operating system, after Android. It is the basis for three other operating systems made by Apple: iPadOS, tvOS, and watchOS.[12] It is proprietary software, although some parts of it are open source under the Apple Public Source License and other licenses.[13]\nUnveiled in 2007 for the first-generation iPhone, iOS has since been extended to support other Apple devices such as the iPod Touch (September 2007) and the iPad (introduced: January 2010; availability:  April 2010). As of March\u00a02018[update], Apple's App Store contains more than 2.1\u00a0million iOS applications, 1\u00a0million of which are native for iPads.[14] These mobile apps have collectively been downloaded more than 130\u00a0billion times.\nMajor versions of iOS are released annually. The current stable version, iOS 16, was released to the public on September 12, 2022.[15]\nIn 2005, when Steve Jobs began planning the iPhone, he had a choice to either \"shrink the Mac, which would be an epic feat of engineering, or enlarge the iPod\". Jobs favored the former approach but pitted the Macintosh and iPod teams, led by Scott Forstall and Tony Fadell, respectively, against each other in an internal competition, with Forstall winning by creating the iPhone OS. The decision enabled the success of the iPhone as a platform for third-party developers: using a well-known desktop operating system as its basis allowed the many third-party Mac developers to write software for the iPhone with minimal retraining. Forstall was also responsible for creating a software development kit for programmers to build iPhone apps, as well as an App Store within iTunes.[16][17]\nThe operating system was unveiled with the iPhone at the Macworld Conference & Expo on January 9, 2007, and released in June of that year.[18][19][20] At the time of its unveiling in January, Steve Jobs claimed: \"iPhone runs OS X\" and runs \"desktop class applications\",[21][22] but at the time of the iPhone's release, the operating system was renamed \"iPhone OS\".[23] Initially, third-party native applications were not supported. Jobs' reasoning was that developers could build web applications through the Safari web browser that \"would behave like native apps on the iPhone\".[24][25] In October 2007, Apple announced that a native Software Development Kit (SDK) was under development and that they planned to put it \"in developers' hands in February\".[26][27][28] On March 6, 2008, Apple held a press event, announcing the iPhone SDK.[29][30]\nThe iOS App Store was opened on July 10, 2008, with an initial 500 applications available.[31] This quickly grew to 3,000 in September 2008,[32] 15,000 in January 2009,[33] 50,000 in June 2009,[34] 100,000 in November 2009,[35][36] 250,000 in August 2010,[37][38] 650,000 in July 2012,[39] 1\u00a0million in October 2013,[40][41] 2\u00a0million in June 2016,[42][43][44] and 2.2\u00a0million in January 2017.[45][46] As of March\u00a02016[update], 1\u00a0million apps are natively compatible with the iPad tablet computer.[47] These apps have collectively been downloaded more than 130\u00a0billion times.[42] App intelligence firm Sensor Tower estimated that the App Store would reach 5\u00a0million apps by 2020.[48]\nIn September 2007, Apple announced the iPod Touch, a redesigned iPod based on the iPhone form factor.[49] On January 27, 2010, Apple introduced their much-anticipated media tablet, the iPad, featuring a larger screen than the iPhone and iPod Touch, and designed for web browsing, media consumption, and reading, and offering multi-touch interaction with multimedia formats including newspapers, e-books, photos, videos, music, word processing documents, video games, and most existing iPhone apps using a 9.7-inch (25\u00a0cm) screen.[50][51][52] It also includes a mobile version of Safari for web browsing, as well as access to the App Store, iTunes Library, iBookstore, Contacts, and Notes. Content is downloadable via Wi-Fi and optional 3G service or synced through the user's computer.[53] AT&T was initially the sole U.S. provider of 3G wireless access for the iPad.[54]\nIn June 2010, Apple rebranded iPhone OS as \"iOS\".[55][56]  The trademark \"IOS\" had been used by Cisco for over a decade for its operating system, IOS, used on its routers. To avoid any potential lawsuit, Apple licensed the \"IOS\" trademark from Cisco.[57]\nThe Apple Watch smartwatch was announced by Tim Cook on September 9, 2014, being introduced as a product with health and fitness-tracking.[58][59] It was released on April 24, 2015.[60][61][62] It uses watchOS as its operating system; watchOS is based on iOS, with new features created specially for the Apple Watch such as an activity tracking app.[63]\nIn October 2016, Apple opened its first iOS Developer Academy in Naples inside University of Naples Federico II's new campus.[64][65] The course is completely free, aimed at acquiring specific technical skills on the creation and management of applications for the Apple ecosystem platforms.[66] At the academy there are also issues of business administration (business planning and business management with a focus on digital opportunities) and there is a path dedicated to the design of graphical interfaces. Students have the opportunity to participate in the \"Enterprise Track\", an in-depth training experience on the entire life cycle of an app, from design to implementation, to security, troubleshooting, data storage and cloud usage.[67][68] As of 2020, the academy graduated almost a thousand students from all over the world, who have worked on 400 app ideas and have already published about 50 apps on the iOS App Store. In the 2018\u20132019 academic year, students from more than 30 countries arrived. 35 of these have been selected to attend the Worldwide Developer Conference, the annual Apple Developer Conference held annually in California in early June.[69][70]\nOn June 3, 2019, iPadOS, the branded version of iOS for iPad, was announced at the 2019 WWDC; it was launched on September 25, 2019.[71]\nThe iOS user interface is based upon direct manipulation, using multi-touch gestures such as swipe, tap, pinch, and reverse pinch. Interface control elements include sliders, switches, and buttons.[72] Internal accelerometers are used by some applications to respond to shaking the device (one common result is the undo command) or rotating it in three dimensions (one common result is switching between portrait and landscape mode). Various accessibility described in \u00a7\u00a0Accessibility functions enable users with vision and hearing disabilities to properly use iOS.[73]\niOS devices boot to the homescreen, the primary navigation and information \"hub\" on iOS devices, analogous to the desktop found on personal computers. iOS homescreens are typically made up of app icons and widgets; app icons launch the associated app, whereas widgets display live, auto-updating content, such as a weather forecast, the user's email inbox, or a news ticker directly on the homescreen.[74]\nAlong the top of the screen is a status bar, showing information about the device and its connectivity. The status bar itself contains two elements, the Control Center and the Notification Center. The Control Center can be \"pulled\" down from the top right of the notch, on the new iPhones, giving access to various toggles to manage the device more quickly without having to open the Settings. It is possible to manage brightness, volume, wireless connections, music player, etc.[75]\nInstead, scrolling from the top left to the bottom will open the Notification Center, which in the latest versions of iOS is very similar to the lockscreen. It displays notifications in chronological order and groups them by application. From the notifications of some apps it is possible to interact directly, for example by replying a message directly from it. Notifications are sent in two modes, the important notifications that are displayed on the lock screen and signaled by a distinctive sound, accompanied by a warning banner and the app badge icon, and the secondary mode where they are displayed in the Notification Center, but they are not shown on the lock screen, nor are they indicated by warning banners, badge icons or sounds.[76][77]\nOn earlier iPhones with home button, screenshots can be created with the simultaneous press of the home and power buttons. In comparison to Android OS, which requires the buttons to be held down, a short press does suffice on iOS.[78] On the more recent iPhones which lack a physical home button, screenshots are captured using the volume-up and power buttons instead.[79]\nThe camera application used a skeuomorphic closing camera shutter animation prior to iOS 7. Since then, it uses a simple short blackout effect.[80] Notable additions over time include HDR photography and the option to save both normal and high dynamic range photographs simultaneously where the former prevents ghosting effects from moving objects (since iPhone 5, iOS 6), automatic HDR adjustment (iOS 7.1), \"live photo\" with short video bundled to each photo if enabled (iPhone 6s, iOS 9), and a digital zoom shortcut (iPhone 7 Plus, iOS 10).[81][82][83] Some camera settings such as video resolution and frame rate are not adjustable through the camera interface itself, but are outsourced to the system settings.[84]\nA new feature in iOS 13 called \"context menus\" shows related actions when you touch and hold an item. When the context menu is displayed, the background is blurred.[85]\nTo choose from a few options, a selection control is used. Selectors can appear anchored at the bottom or in line with the content (called date selectors). Date selectors take on the appearance of any other selection control, but with a column for day, month, and optionally year.\nAlerts appear in the center of the screen, but there are also alerts that scroll up from the bottom of the screen (called \"action panels\"). Destructive actions (such as eliminating any element) are colored red.\nThe official font of iOS is San Francisco. It is designed for small text readability, and is used throughout the operating system, including third-party apps.[85]\nThe icons are 180x180px in size for iPhones with a larger screen, usually models over 6 inches, including iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 8 Plus, while it's 120x120px on iPhones with smaller displays.[86]\niOS devices come with preinstalled apps developed by Apple including Mail, Maps, TV, Music, FaceTime, Wallet, Health, and many more.\nApplications (\"apps\") are the most general form of application software that can be installed on iOS. They are downloaded from the official catalog of the App Store digital store, where apps are subjected to security checks before being made available to users. In June 2017, Apple updated its guidelines to specify that app developers will no longer have the ability to use custom prompts for encouraging users to leave reviews for their apps.[87][88] IOS applications can also be installed directly from an IPA file provided by the software distributor, via unofficial ways. They are written using iOS Software Development Kit (SDK) and, often, combined with Xcode, using officially supported programming languages, including Swift and Objective-C. Other companies have also created tools that allow for the development of native iOS apps using their respective programming languages.\nApplications for iOS are mostly built using components of UIKit, a programming framework. It allows applications to have a consistent look and feel with the OS, nevertheless offering customization.\nElements automatically update along with iOS updates, automatically including new interface rules. UIKit elements are very adaptable, this allows developers to design a single app that looks the same on any iOS device. In addition to defining the iOS interface, UIKit defines the functionality of the application.\nAt first, Apple did not intend to release an SDK to developers, because they did not want third-party apps to be developed for iOS, building web apps instead. However, this technology never entered into common use, this led Apple to change its opinion, so in October 2007 the SDK for developers was announced, finally released on March 6, 2008.\nThe SDK includes an inclusive set of development tools,[89] including an audio mixer and an iPhone simulator. It is a free download for Mac users. It is not available for Microsoft Windows PCs. To test the application, get technical support, and distribute applications through App Store, developers are required to subscribe to the Apple Developer Program.\nOver the years, the Apple Store apps surpassed multiple major milestones, including 50,000,[90] 100,000,[91] 250,000,[92] 500,000,[93] 1\u00a0million,[94] and 2\u00a0million apps.[95] The billionth application was installed on April 24, 2009.[96]\nThe home screen, rendered by SpringBoard, displays application icons and a dock at the bottom where users can pin their most frequently used apps. The home screen appears whenever the user unlocks the device, presses the physical \"Home\" button while in an app, or swipes up from the bottom of the screen using the home bar.[97] Before iOS 4 on the iPhone 3GS (or later), the screen's background could be customized only through jailbreaking, but can now be changed out-of-the-box. The screen has a status bar across the top to display data, such as time, battery level, and signal strength. The rest of the screen is devoted to the current application. When a passcode is set and a user switches on the device, the passcode must be entered at the Lock Screen before access to the Home screen is granted.[98]\nIn iPhone OS 3, Spotlight was introduced, allowing users to search media, apps, emails, contacts, messages, reminders, calendar events, and similar content. In iOS 7 and later, Spotlight is accessed by pulling down anywhere on the home screen (except for the top and bottom edges that open Notification Center and Control Center).[99][100] In iOS 9, there are two ways to access Spotlight. As with iOS 7 and 8, pulling down on any homescreen will show Spotlight. However, it can also be accessed as it was in iOS versions 3 through 6. This endows Spotlight with Siri suggestions, which include app suggestions, contact suggestions and news.[101] In iOS 10, Spotlight is at the top of the now-dedicated \"Today\" panel.[102]\nSince iOS 3.2, users are able to set a background image for the Home Screen. This feature is only available on third-generation devices\u2014iPhone 3GS, third-generation iPod Touch (iOS 4.0 or newer), and all iPad models (since iOS 3.2)\u2014or newer.[citation needed]\niOS 7 introduced a parallax effect on the Home Screen, which shifts the device's wallpaper and icons in response to the movement of the device, creating a 3D effect and an illusion of floating icons. This effect is also visible in the tab view of Mail and Safari.[103]\nResearchers found that users organize icons on their homescreens based on usage frequency and relatedness of the applications, as well as for reasons of usability and aesthetics.[104]\niOS originally used Helvetica as the system font. Apple switched to Helvetica Neue exclusively for the iPhone 4 and its Retina Display, and retained Helvetica as the system font for older iPhone devices on iOS 4.[105] With iOS 7, Apple announced that they would change the system font to Helvetica Neue Light, a decision that sparked criticism for inappropriate usage of a light, thin typeface for low-resolution mobile screens. Apple eventually chose Helvetica Neue instead.[106][107] The release of iOS 7 also introduced the ability to scale text or apply other forms of text accessibility changes through Settings.[108][109] With iOS 9, Apple changed the font to San Francisco, an Apple-designed font aimed at maximum legibility and font consistency across its product lineup.[110][111]\niOS 4 introduced folders, which can be created by dragging an application on top of another, and from then on, more items can be added to the folder using the same procedure. A title for the folder is automatically selected by the category of applications inside, but the name can also be edited by the user.[112] When apps inside folders receive notification badges, the individual numbers of notifications are added up and the total number is displayed as a notification badge on the folder itself.[112] Originally, folders on an iPhone could include up to 12 apps, while folders on iPad could include 20.[113] With increasing display sizes on newer iPhone hardware, iOS 7 updated the folders with pages similar to the home screen layout, allowing for a significant expansion of folder functionality. Each page of a folder can contain up to nine apps, and there can be 15 pages in total, allowing for a total of 135 apps in a single folder.[114] In iOS 9, Apple updated folder sizes for iPad hardware, allowing for 16 apps per page, still at 15 pages maximum, increasing the total to 240 apps.[115]\nBefore iOS 5, notifications were delivered in a modal window and couldn't be viewed after being dismissed. In iOS 5, Apple introduced Notification Center, which allows users to view a history of notifications. The user can tap a notification to open its corresponding app, or clear it.[116] Notifications are now delivered in banners that appear briefly at the top of the screen. If a user taps a received notification, the application that sent the notification will be opened. Users can also choose to view notifications in modal alert windows by adjusting the application's notification settings. Introduced with iOS 8, widgets are now accessible through the Notification Center, defined by 3rd parties.[citation needed]\nWhen an app sends a notification while closed, a red badge appears on its icon. This badge tells the user, at a glance, how many notifications that app has sent. Opening the app clears the badge.\niOS offers various accessibility features to help users with vision and hearing disabilities. One major feature, VoiceOver, provides a voice reading information on the screen, including contextual buttons, icons, links and other user interface elements, and allows the user to navigate the operating system through gestures. Any apps with default controls and developed with a UIKit framework gets VoiceOver functionality built in.[117] One example includes holding up the iPhone to take a photo, with VoiceOver describing the photo scenery.[118] As part of a \"Made for iPhone\" program, introduced with the release of iOS 7 in 2013, Apple has developed technology to use Bluetooth and a special technology protocol to let compatible third-party equipment connect with iPhones and iPads for streaming audio directly to a user's ears. Additional customization available for Made for iPhone products include battery tracking and adjustable sound settings for different environments.[119][120] Apple made further efforts for accessibility for the release of iOS 10 in 2016, adding a new pronunciation editor to VoiceOver, adding a Magnifier setting to enlarge objects through the device's camera, software TTY support for deaf people to make phone calls from the iPhone, and giving tutorials and guidelines for third-party developers to incorporate proper accessibility functions into their apps.[121]\nIn 2012, Liat Kornowski from The Atlantic wrote that \"the iPhone has turned out to be one of the most revolutionary developments since the invention of Braille\",[122] and in 2016, Steven Aquino of TechCrunch described Apple as \"leading the way in assistive technology\", with Sarah Herrlinger, Senior Manager for Global Accessibility Policy and Initiatives at Apple, stating that \"We see accessibility as a basic human right. Building into the core of our products supports a vision of an inclusive world where opportunity and access to information are barrier-free, empowering individuals with disabilities to achieve their goals\".[123]\nCriticism has been aimed at iOS depending on both internet connection (either WiFi or through iTunes) and a working SIM card upon first activation.[124] This restriction has been loosened in iOS 12, which no longer requires the latter.[125]\nMultitasking for iOS was first released in June 2010 along with the release of iOS 4.[126][127] Only certain devices\u2014iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, and iPod Touch 3rd generation\u2014were able to multitask.[128] The iPad did not get multitasking until iOS 4.2.1 in that November.[129]\nThe implementation of multitasking in iOS has been criticized for its approach, which limits the work that applications in the background can perform to a limited function set and requires application developers to add explicit support for it.[128][130]\nBefore iOS 4, multitasking was limited to a selection of the applications Apple included on the device. Users could however \"jailbreak\" their device in order to unofficially multitask.[131] Starting with iOS 4, on third-generation and newer iOS devices, multitasking is supported through seven background APIs:[132]\nIn iOS 5, three new background APIs were introduced:\nIn iOS 7, Apple introduced a new multitasking feature, providing all apps with the ability to perform background updates. This feature prefers to update the user's most frequently used apps and prefers to use Wi-Fi networks over a cellular network, without markedly reducing the device's battery life.\nIn iOS 4.0 to iOS 6.x, double-clicking the home button activates the application switcher. A scrollable dock-style interface appears from the bottom, moving the contents of the screen up. Choosing an icon switches to an application. To the far left are icons which function as music controls, a rotation lock, and on iOS 4.2 and above, a volume controller.\nWith the introduction of iOS 7, double-clicking the home button also activates the application switcher. However, unlike previous versions it displays screenshots of open applications on top of the icon and horizontal scrolling allows for browsing through previous apps, and it is possible to close applications by dragging them up, similar to how WebOS handled multiple cards.[134]\nWith the introduction of iOS 9, the application switcher received a significant visual change; while still retaining the card metaphor introduced in iOS 7, the application icon is smaller, and appears above the screenshot (which is now larger, due to the removal of \"Recent and Favorite Contacts\"), and each application \"card\" overlaps the other, forming a rolodex effect as the user scrolls. Now, instead of the home screen appearing at the leftmost of the application switcher, it appears rightmost.[135] In iOS 11, the application switcher receives a major redesign. In the iPad, the Control Center and app switcher are combined. The app switcher in the iPad can also be accessed by swiping up from the bottom. In the iPhone, the app switcher cannot be accessed if there are no apps in the RAM.\nIn iOS 4.0 to iOS 6.x, briefly holding the icons in the application switcher makes them \"jiggle\" (similarly to the homescreen) and allows the user to force quit the applications by tapping the red minus circle that appears at the corner of the app's icon.[136] Clearing applications from multitasking stayed the same from iOS 4.0 through 6.1.6, the last version of iOS 6.\nAs of iOS 7, the process has become faster and easier. In iOS 7, instead of holding the icons to close them, they are closed by simply swiping them upwards off the screen. Up to three apps can be cleared at a time compared to one in versions up to iOS 6.1.6.[137]\nTask completion allows apps to continue a certain task after the app has been suspended.[138][139] As of iOS 4.0, apps can request up to ten minutes to complete a task in the background.[140] This doesn't extend to background uploads and downloads though (e.g. if a user starts a download in one application, it won't finish if they switch away from the application).\nSiri (/\u02c8s\u026ari/) is an intelligent personal assistant integrated into iOS. The assistant uses voice queries and a natural language user interface to answer questions, make recommendations, and perform actions by delegating requests to a set of Internet services. The software adapts to users' individual language usages, searches, and preferences, with continuing use. Returned results are individualized.\nOriginally released as an app for iOS in February 2010,[141] it was acquired by Apple two months later,[142][143][144] and then integrated into iPhone 4S at its release in October 2011.[145][146] At that time, the separate app was also removed from the iOS App Store.[147]\nSiri supports a wide range of user commands, including performing phone actions, checking basic information, scheduling events and reminders, handling device settings, searching the Internet, navigating areas, finding information on entertainment, and is able to engage with iOS-integrated apps.[148] With the release of iOS 10 in 2016, Apple opened up limited third-party access to Siri, including third-party messaging apps, as well as payments, ride-sharing, and Internet calling apps.[149][150] With the release of iOS 11, Apple updated Siri's voices for more clear, human voices, it now supports follow-up questions and language translation, and additional third-party actions.[151][152]\nGame Center is an online multiplayer \"social gaming network\"[153] released by Apple.[154] It allows users to \"invite friends to play a game, start a multiplayer game through matchmaking, track their achievements, and compare their high scores on a leaderboard.\" iOS 5 and above adds support for profile photos.[153]\nGame Center was announced during an iOS 4 preview event hosted by Apple on April 8, 2010. A preview was released to registered Apple developers in August.[153] It was released on September 8, 2010, with iOS 4.1 on iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, and iPod Touch 2nd generation through 4th generation.[155] Game Center made its public debut on the iPad with iOS 4.2.1.[156] There is no support for the iPhone 3G, original iPhone and the first-generation iPod Touch (the latter two devices did not have Game Center because they did not get iOS 4).[157] However, Game Center is unofficially available on the iPhone 3G via a hack.[158]\nThe main hardware platform for iOS is the ARM architecture (the ARMv7, ARMv8-A, ARMv8.2-A, ARMv8.3-A). iOS releases before iOS 7 can only be run on iOS devices with 32-bit ARM processors (ARMv6 and ARMv7-A architectures). In 2013, iOS 7 was released with full 64-bit support (which includes a native 64-bit kernel, libraries, drivers as well as all built-in applications),[159] after Apple announced that they were switching to 64-bit ARMv8-A processors with the introduction of the Apple A7 chip.[160] 64-bit support was also enforced for all apps in the App Store; All new apps submitted to the App Store with a deadline of February 2015, and all app updates submitted to the App Store with a deadline of June 1, 2015.[161] iOS 11 drops support for all iOS devices with 32-bit ARM processors as well as 32-bit applications,[162][163] making iOS 64-bit only.[164]\niOS has support for many locales.\nThe iOS SDK (Software Development Kit) allows for the development of mobile apps on iOS.\nWhile originally developing iPhone prior to its unveiling in 2007, Apple's then-CEO Steve Jobs did not intend to let third-party developers build native apps for iOS, instead directing them to make web applications for the Safari web browser.[165] However, backlash from developers prompted the company to reconsider,[165] with Jobs announcing in October 2007 that Apple would have a software development kit available for developers by February 2008.[166][167] The SDK was released on March 6, 2008.[168][169]\nThe SDK is a free download for users of Mac personal computers.[170] It is not available for Microsoft Windows PCs.[170] The SDK contains sets giving developers access to various functions and services of iOS devices, such as hardware and software attributes.[171] It also contains an iPhone simulator to mimic the look and feel of the device on the computer while developing.[171] New versions of the SDK accompany new versions of iOS.[172][173] In order to test applications, get technical support, and distribute apps through App Store, developers are required to subscribe to the Apple Developer Program.[170]\nCombined with Xcode, the iOS SDK helps developers write iOS apps using officially supported programming languages, including Swift and Objective-C.[174] Other companies have also created tools that allow for the development of native iOS apps using their respective programming languages.[175][176]\niPhone platform usage as measured by the App Store on May 31st, 2022[177]\niPad platform usage as measured by the App Store on May 31st, 2022[177]\nApple provides major updates to the iOS operating system annually via iTunes and, since iOS 5, also over-the-air.[178] The device checks an XML-based PLIST file on mesu.apple.com for updates. Updates are delivered as unencrypted ZIP files. Updates are checked for regularly, and are downloaded and installed automatically if enabled. Otherwise, the user can install them manually or are prompted to allow automatic installation overnight if plugged in and connected to Wi-Fi.\niPod Touch users originally had to pay for system software updates due to accounting rules that designated it not a \"subscription device\" like the iPhone or Apple TV,[179][180] causing many iPod Touch owners not to update.[181] In September 2009, a change in accounting rules won tentative approval, affecting Apple's earnings and stock price, and allowing iPod Touch updates to be delivered free of charge.[182][183]\nApple significantly extended the cycle of updates for iOS-supported devices over the years. The iPhone (1st generation) and iPhone 3G only received two iOS updates, while later models had support for five, six, and seven years.[184][185]\nThe iOS kernel is the XNU kernel of Darwin. The original iPhone OS (1.0) up to iPhone OS 3.1.3 used Darwin 9.0.0d1. iOS 4 was based on Darwin 10. iOS 5 was based on Darwin 11. iOS 6 was based on Darwin 13. iOS 7 and iOS 8 are based on Darwin 14. iOS 9 is based on Darwin 15. iOS 10 is based on Darwin 16. iOS 11 is based on Darwin 17. iOS 12 is based on Darwin 18. iOS 13 is based on Darwin 19. iOS 14 is based on Darwin 20. iOS 15 is based on Darwin 21. iOS 16 is based on Darwin 22.[186]\nIn iOS 6 the kernel is subject to ASLR, similar to that of OS X Mountain Lion. This makes exploit possibilities more complex since it is not possible to know the location of kernel code.\nApple has made the XNU kernel open source.[187] The source is under a 3-clause[188] BSD license for the original BSD parts, with parts added by Apple under the Apple Public Source License.[189] The versions contained in iOS are not available; only the versions used in macOS are available.\niOS does not have kernel extensions (kexts) in the file system, even if they are actually present. The kernel cache can be decompressed to show the correct kernel, along with the kexts (all packed in the __PRELINK_TEXT section) and their plists (in the __PRELINK_INFO section).\nThe kernel cache can also be directly decompressed (if decrypted) using third-party tools. With the advent of iOS 10 betas and default plain text kernelcaches, these tools can only be used after unpacking and applying lzssdec to unpack the kernel cache to its full size.\nThe kextstat provided by the Cydia alternative software does not work on iOS because the kextstat is based on kmod_get_info(...), which is a deprecated API in iOS 4 and Mac OS X Snow Leopard. There are other alternative software that can also dump raw XML data.\nOn developing devices, the kernel is always stored as a statically linked cache stored in /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.kernelcaches/kernelcache which is unpacked and executed at boot.\nIn the beginning, iOS had a kernel version usually higher than the corresponding version of macOS. Over time, the kernels of iOS and macOS have gotten closer. This is not surprising, considering that iOS introduced new features (such as the ASLR Kernel, the default freezer, and various security-strengthening features) that were first incorporated and subsequently arrived on macOS. It appears Apple is gradually merging the iOS and macOS kernels over time. The build date for each version varies slightly between processors. This is due to the fact that the builds are sequential.\nThe kernel image base is randomized by the boot loader (iBoot). This is done by creating random data, doing a SHA-1 hash of it and then using a byte from the SHA-1 hash for the kernel slide. The slide is calculated with this formula:\nIf the slide is 0, the static offset of 0x21000000 is used instead.\nThe adjusted base is passed to the kernel in the boot arguments structure at offset 0x04, which is equivalent to gBootArgs->virtBase.\nThe kernel map is used for kernel allocations of all types (kalloc(), kernel_memory_allocate(), etc.) and spans all of kernel space (0x80000000-0xFFFEFFFF). The kernel based maps are submaps of the kernel_map, for example zone_map, ipc_kernel_map, etc.\nThe strategy is to randomize the base of the kernel_map. A random 9-bit value is generated right after kmem_init() which establishes kernel_map, is multiplied by the page size. The resulting value is used as the size for the initial kernel_map allocation. Future kernel_map (and submap) allocations are pushed forward by a random amount. The allocation is silently removed after the first garbage collection and reused. This behaviour can be overridden with the \"kmapoff\" boot parameter.\nKext_request() allows applications to request information about kernel modules, divided into active and passive operations. Active operations (load, unload, start, stop, etc.) require root access. iOS removes the ability to load kernel extensions. Passive operations were originally (before iOS 6) unrestricted and allowed unprivileged users to query kernel module base addresses. iOS6 inadvertently removed some limitations; only the load address requests are disallowed. So attackers can use kKextRequestPredicateGetLoaded to get load addresses and mach-o header dumps. The load address and mach-o segment headers are obscured to hide the ASLR slide, but mach-o section headers are not. This reveals the virtual addresses of loaded kernel sections.\nThis information leak has been closed with iOS 6.0.1.\nInternally, iOS identifies each version by a codename, often used internally only, normally to maintain secrecy of the project. For example, the codename for iOS 14 is Azul.\nSince its initial release, iOS has been subject to a variety of different hacks centered around adding functionality not allowed by Apple.[190] Prior to the 2008 debut of Apple's native iOS App Store, the primary motive for jailbreaking was to bypass Apple's purchase mechanism for installing the App Store's native applications.[191] Apple claimed that it would not release iOS software updates designed specifically to break these tools (other than applications that perform SIM unlocking); however, with each subsequent iOS update, previously un-patched jailbreak exploits are usually patched.[192]\nWhen a device is booting, it loads Apple's own kernel initially, so a jailbroken device must be exploited and have the kernel patched each time it is booted up.\nThere are different types of jailbreak. An untethered jailbreak uses exploits that are powerful enough to allow the user to turn their device off and back on at will, with the device starting up completely, and the kernel will be patched without the help of a computer \u2013 in other words, it will be jailbroken even after each reboot.\nHowever, some jailbreaks are tethered. A tethered jailbreak is only able to temporarily jailbreak the device during a single boot. If the user turns the device off and then boots it back up without the help of a jailbreak tool, the device will no longer be running a patched kernel, and it may get stuck in a partially started state, such as Recovery Mode. In order for the device to start completely and with a patched kernel, it must be \"re-jailbroken\" with a computer (using the \"boot tethered\" feature of a tool) each time it is turned on. All changes to the files on the device (such as installed package files or edited system files) will persist between reboots, including changes that can only function if the device is jailbroken (such as installed package files).\nIn more recent years, two other solutions have been created \u2013 semi-tethered and semi-untethered.\nA semi-tethered solution is one where the device is able to start up on its own, but it will no longer have a patched kernel, and therefore will not be able to run modified code. It will, however, still be usable for normal functions, just like stock iOS. To start with a patched kernel, the user must start the device with the help of the jailbreak tool.\nA semi-untethered jailbreak gives the ability to start the device on its own. On first boot, the device will not be running a patched kernel. However, rather than having to run a tool from a computer to apply the kernel patches, the user is able to re-jailbreak their device with the help of an app (usually sideloaded using Cydia Impactor) running on their device. In the case of the iOS 9.2-9.3.3 and 64-bit 10.x jailbreaks, Safari-based exploits were available, thereby meaning websites could be used to rejailbreak.\nIn more detail: Each iOS device has a bootchain that tries to make sure only trusted/signed code is loaded. A device with a tethered jailbreak is able to boot up with the help of a jailbreaking tool because the tool executes exploits via USB that bypass parts of that \"chain of trust\", bootstrapping to a pwned (no signature check) iBSS, iBEC, or iBoot to finish the boot process.\nSince the arrival of Apple's native iOS App Store, and\u2014along with it\u2014third-party applications, the general motives for jailbreaking have changed.[193] People jailbreak for many different reasons, including gaining filesystem access, installing custom device themes, and modifying SpringBoard. An additional motivation is that it may enable the installation of pirated apps. On some devices, jailbreaking also makes it possible to install alternative operating systems, such as Android and the Linux kernel. Primarily, users jailbreak their devices because of the limitations of iOS. Depending on the method used, the effects of jailbreaking may be permanent or temporary.[194]\nIn 2010, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) successfully convinced the U.S. Copyright Office to allow an exemption to the general prohibition on circumvention of copyright protection systems under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). The exemption allows jailbreaking of iPhones for the sole purpose of allowing legally obtained applications to be added to the iPhone.[195] The exemption does not affect the contractual relations between Apple and an iPhone owner, for example, jailbreaking voiding the iPhone warranty; however, it is solely based on Apple's discretion on whether they will fix jailbroken devices in the event that they need to be repaired. At the same time, the Copyright Office exempted unlocking an iPhone from DMCA's anticircumvention prohibitions.[196] Unlocking an iPhone allows the iPhone to be used with any wireless carrier using the same GSM or CDMA technology for which the particular phone model was designed to operate.[197]\nInitially most wireless carriers in the US did not allow iPhone owners to unlock it for use with other carriers. However AT&T allowed iPhone owners who had satisfied contract requirements to unlock their iPhone.[198] Instructions to unlock the device are available from Apple,[199] but it is ultimately at the sole discretion of the carrier to authorize unlocking the device.[200] This allows the use of a carrier-sourced iPhone on other networks. Modern versions of iOS and the iPhone fully support LTE across multiple carriers wherever the phone was purchased.[201] Programs to remove SIM lock restrictions are available, but are not supported by Apple, and most often not a permanent unlock \u2013 a soft unlock,[202] which modifies the iPhone so that the baseband will accept the SIM card of any GSM carrier. SIM unlocking is not jailbreaking, but a jailbreak is also required for these unofficial software unlocks.\nThe legality of software unlocking varies in each country; for example, in the US, there is a DMCA exemption for unofficial software unlocking of devices purchased before January 26, 2013.[203]\nThe closed and proprietary nature of iOS has garnered criticism, particularly by digital rights advocates such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation, computer engineer and activist Brewster Kahle, Internet-law specialist Jonathan Zittrain, and the Free Software Foundation who protested the iPad's introductory event and have targeted the iPad with their \"Defective by Design\" campaign.[204][205][206][207] Competitor Microsoft, via a PR spokesman, criticized Apple's control over its platform.[208]\nAt issue are restrictions imposed by the design of iOS, namely digital rights management (DRM) intended to lock purchased media to Apple's platform, the development model (requiring a yearly subscription to distribute apps developed for the iOS), the centralized approval process for apps, as well as Apple's general control and lockdown of the platform itself. Particularly at issue is the ability for Apple to remotely disable or delete apps at will.\nSome in the tech community have expressed concern that the locked-down iOS represents a growing trend in Apple's approach to computing, particularly Apple's shift away from machines that hobbyists can \"tinker with\" and note the potential for such restrictions to stifle software innovation.[209][210]\nFormer Facebook developer Joe Hewitt protested against Apple's control over its hardware as a \"horrible precedent\" but praised iOS's sandboxing of apps.[211]\niOS utilizes many security features in both hardware and software. Below are summaries of the most prominent features.\nBefore fully booting into iOS, there is low-level code that runs from the Boot ROM. Its task is to verify that the Low-Level Bootloader is signed by the Apple Root CA public key before running it. This process is to ensure that no malicious or otherwise unauthorized software can be run on an iOS device. After the Low-Level Bootloader finishes its tasks, it runs the higher level bootloader, known as iBoot. If all goes well, iBoot will then proceed to load the iOS kernel as well as the rest of the operating system.[212]\nThe Secure Enclave is a coprocessor found in iOS devices part of the A7 and newer chips used for data protection, Touch ID and Face ID. The purpose of the Secure Enclave is to handle keys and other info such as biometrics that is sensitive enough to not be handled by the Application Processor (AP). It is isolated with a hardware filter so the AP cannot access it. It shares RAM with the AP, but its portion of the RAM (known as TZ0) is encrypted. The secure enclave itself is a flashable 4\u00a0MB AKF processor core called the secure enclave processor (SEP) as documented in Apple Patent Application 20130308838. The technology used is similar to ARM's TrustZone/SecurCore but contains proprietary code for Apple KF cores in general and SEP specifically. It is also responsible for generating the UID key on A9 or newer chips that protects user data at rest.[citation needed]\nIt has its own secure boot process to ensure that it is completely secure. A hardware random number generator is also included as a part of this coprocessor. Each device's Secure Enclave has a unique ID that is given to it when it is made and cannot be changed. This identifier is used to create a temporary key that encrypts the memory in this portion of the system. The Secure Enclave also contains an anti-replay counter to prevent brute force attacks.[212]\nThe SEP is located in the devicetree under IODeviceTree:/arm-io/sep and managed by the AppleSEPManager driver.[213]\nIn 2020, security flaws in the SEP were discovered, causing concerns about Apple devices such as iPhones.[214]\nFace ID is a face scanner that is embedded in the notch on iPhone models X, XS, XS Max, XR, 11, 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max, 12, 12 Mini, 12 Pro, 12 Pro Max, 13, 13 Mini, 13 Pro, 13 Pro Max, 14, and the 14 Plus. On the iPhone 14 Pro and the 14 Pro Max, it is embedded in the Dynamic Island.[215] It can be used to unlock the device, make purchases, and log into applications among other functions. When used, Face ID only temporarily stores the face data in encrypted memory in the Secure Enclave, as described above. There is no way for the device's main processor or any other part of the system to access the raw data that is obtained from the Face ID sensor.[212]\niOS devices can have a passcode that is used to unlock the device, make changes to system settings, and encrypt the device's contents. Until recently, these were typically four numerical digits long. However, since unlocking the devices with a fingerprint by using Touch ID has become more widespread, six-digit passcodes are now the default on iOS with the option to switch back to four or use an alphanumeric passcode.[212]\nTouch ID is a fingerprint scanner that is embedded in the home button and can be used to unlock the device, make purchases, and log into applications among other functions. When used, Touch ID only temporarily stores the fingerprint data in encrypted memory in the Secure Enclave, as described above. Like Face ID, there is no way for the device's main processor or any other part of the system to access the raw fingerprint data that is obtained from the Touch ID sensor.[212]\nAddress Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) is a low-level technique of preventing memory corruption attacks such as buffer overflows. It involves placing data in randomly selected locations in memory in order to make it more difficult to predict ways to corrupt the system and create exploits. ASLR makes app bugs more likely to crash the app than to silently overwrite memory, regardless of whether the behavior is accidental or malicious.[216]\niOS utilizes the ARM architecture's Execute Never (XN) feature. This allows some portions of the memory to be marked as non-executable, working alongside ASLR to prevent buffer overflow attacks including return-to-libc attacks.[212]\nAs mentioned above, one use of encryption in iOS is in the memory of the Secure Enclave. When a passcode is utilized on an iOS device, the contents of the device are encrypted. This is done by using a hardware AES 256 implementation that is very efficient because it is placed directly between the flash storage and RAM.[212]\niOS, in combination with its specific hardware, uses crypto-shredding when erasing all content and settings by obliterating all the keys in 'effaceable storage'. This renders all user data on the device cryptographically inaccessible.[217]\nThe iOS keychain is a database of login information that can be shared across apps written by the same person or organization.[212] This service is often used for storing passwords for web applications.[218]\nThird-party applications such as those distributed through the App Store must be code signed with an Apple-issued certificate. In principle, this continues the chain of trust all the way from the Secure Boot process as mentioned above to the actions of the applications installed on the device by users. Applications are also sandboxed, meaning that they can only modify the data within their individual home directory unless explicitly given permission to do otherwise. For example, they cannot access data owned by other user-installed applications on the device. There is a very extensive set of privacy controls contained within iOS with options to control apps' ability to access a wide variety of permissions such as the camera, contacts, background app refresh, cellular data, and access to other data and services. Most of the code in iOS, including third-party applications, runs as the \"mobile\" user which does not have root privileges. This ensures that system files and other iOS system resources remain hidden and inaccessible to user-installed applications.[212]\nCompanies can apply to Apple for enterprise developer certificates. These can be used to sign apps such that iOS will install them directly (sometimes called \"sideloading\"), without the app needing to be distributed via the App Store.[219] The terms under which they are granted make clear that they are only to be used for companies who wish to distribute apps directly to their employees.[219]\nCirca January\u2013February 2019, it emerged that a number of software developers were misusing enterprise developer certificates to distribute software directly to non-employees, thereby bypassing the App Store. Facebook was found to be abusing an Apple enterprise developer certificate to distribute an application to underage users that would give Facebook access to all private data on their devices.[220][221][222] Google was abusing an Apple enterprise developer certificate to distribute an app to adults to collect data from their devices, including unencrypted data belonging to third parties.[223][219] TutuApp, Panda Helper, AppValley, and TweakBox have all been abusing enterprise developer certificates to distribute apps that offer pirated software.[224]\niOS supports TLS with both low- and high-level APIs for developers. By default, the App Transport Security framework requires that servers use at least TLS 1.2. However, developers are free to override this framework and utilize their own methods of communicating over networks. When Wi-Fi is enabled, iOS uses a randomized MAC address so that devices cannot be tracked by anyone sniffing wireless traffic.[212]\nTwo-factor authentication is an option in iOS to ensure that even if an unauthorized person knows an Apple ID and password combination, they cannot gain access to the account. It works by requiring not only the Apple ID and password, but also a verification code that is sent to an iDevice or mobile phone number that is already known to be trusted.[212] If an unauthorized user attempts to sign in using another user's Apple ID, the owner of the Apple ID receives a notification that allows them to deny access to the unrecognized device.[225]\niOS features a hardened memory allocator known as kalloc_type that was introduced in iOS 15. Since the XNU kernel is primarily written in memory unsafe languages such as C and C++,[226] kalloc_type is designed to mitigate the large amount of vulnerabilities that result from the use of these languages in the kernel. In order to achieve this, kalloc_type implements mitigations such as type isolation in order to prevent type confusion and buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Ultimately, the prevention of privilege escalation is intended.[227]\niOS is the second most popular mobile operating system in the world, after Android. Sales of iPads in recent years are also behind Android, while, by web use (a proxy for all use), iPads (using iOS) are still the most popular.[228]\nBy the middle of 2012, there were 410\u00a0million devices activated.[229] At WWDC 2014, Tim Cook said 800\u00a0million devices had been sold by June 2014.[230]\nDuring Apple's quarterly earnings call in January 2015, the company announced that they had sold over one billion iOS devices since 2007.[231][232]\nBy late 2011, iOS accounted for 60% of the market share for smartphones and tablets.[233] By the end of 2014, iOS accounted for 14.8% of the smartphone market[234] and 27.6% of the tablet and two-in-one market.[235] In February 2015, StatCounter reported iOS was used on 23.18% of smartphones and 66.25% of tablets worldwide, measured by internet usage instead of sales.[236]\nIn the third quarter of 2015, research from Strategy Analytics showed that iOS adoption of the worldwide smartphone market was at a record low 12.1%, attributed to lackluster performance in China and Africa. Android accounted for 87.5% of the market, with Windows Phone and BlackBerry accounting for the rest.[237][238]", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "
