{"Netflix - Wikipedia": {"text": "Netflix, Inc. is an American media company based in Los Gatos, California. Founded in 1997 by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph in Scotts Valley, California, it operates the over-the-top subscription video on-demand service Netflix brand, which includes original films and television series commissioned or acquired by the company, and third-party content licensed from other distributors. Netflix is a member of the Motion Picture Association\u2014having become the first streaming company to become a member.\nNetflix initially both sold and rented DVDs by mail, but the sales were eliminated within a year to focus on the DVD rental business.[13][14] In 2007, Netflix introduced streaming media and video on demand. The company expanded to Canada in 2010, followed by Latin America and the Caribbean. In 2011, the service began to acquire and produce original content, beginning with the political drama House of Cards. By 2022, original productions accounted for half of Netflix's library in the United States, and the company had ventured into other categories, such as video game publishing via the Netflix service.\nThe company is ranked 115th on the Fortune 500[15] and 219th on the Forbes Global 2000.[16] It is the second largest entertainment/media company by market capitalization as of February\u00a02022[update].[17] In 2021, Netflix was ranked as the eighth-most trusted brand globally by Morning Consult.[18] During the 2010s, Netflix was the top-performing stock in the S&P 500 stock market index, with a total return of 3,693%.[19][20] As of January\u00a02023[update], Netflix had over 230 million subscribers worldwide, including 74.3 million in the United States and Canada; 76.7 million in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, 41.7 million in Latin America and 38 million in the Asia-Pacific region.[12] The Netflix service is available worldwide aside from Mainland China, Syria, North Korea, and Russia.\nNetflix is headquartered in Los Gatos, California, in Santa Clara County,[21][22] with the two CEOs, Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos, split between Los Gatos and Los Angeles, respectively.[23][24][25] It also operates international offices in Asia, Europe and Latin America including in Canada, France, Brazil, the Netherlands, India, Italy, Japan, Poland, South Korea and the United Kingdom. The company has production hubs in Los Angeles,[26] Albuquerque,[27] London,[28] Madrid, Vancouver and Toronto.[29]\nNetflix was founded by Marc Randolph and Reed Hastings on August 29, 1997, in Scotts Valley, California. Hastings, a computer scientist and mathematician, was a cofounder of Pure Atria, which was acquired by Rational Software Corporation that year for $750\u00a0million, the then biggest acquisition in Silicon Valley history.[30] Randolph had worked as a marketing director for Pure Atria after Pure Atria acquired a company where Randolph worked. He was previously a co-founder of MicroWarehouse, a computer mail-order company as well as vice president of marketing for Borland International.[31][32] Hastings and Randolph came up with the idea for Netflix while carpooling between their homes in Santa Cruz, California, and Pure Atria's headquarters in Sunnyvale.[14] Patty McCord, later head of human resources at Netflix, was also in the carpool group.[33] Randolph admired Amazon.com and wanted to find a large category of portable items to sell over the Internet using a similar model. Hastings and Randolph considered and rejected selling and renting VHS tapes as too expensive to stock and too delicate to ship.[31] When they heard about DVDs, first introduced in the United States in early 1997, they tested the concept of selling or renting DVDs by mail by mailing a compact disc to Hastings's house in Santa Cruz.[31] When the disc arrived intact, they decided to enter the $16\u00a0billion home-video sales and rental industry.[31][14] Hastings is often quoted saying that he decided to start Netflix after being fined $40 at a Blockbuster store for being late to return a copy of Apollo 13, a claim since repudiated by Randolph.[14] Hastings invested $2.5\u00a0million into Netflix from the sale of Pure Atria.[34][14] Netflix launched as the first DVD rental and sales website with 30 employees and 925 titles available\u2014nearly all DVDs published.[14][35][36] Randolph and Hastings met with Jeff Bezos, where Amazon offered to acquire Netflix for between $14 and $16 million. Fearing competition from Amazon, Randolph at first thought the offer was fair, but Hastings, who owned 70% of the company, turned it down on the plane ride home.[37][38]\nInitially, Netflix offered a per-rental model for each DVD but introduced a monthly subscription concept in September 1999.[39] The per-rental model was dropped by early 2000, allowing the company to focus on the business model of flat-fee unlimited rentals without due dates, late fees, shipping and handling fees, or per-title rental fees.[40] In September 2000, during the dot-com bubble, while Netflix was suffering losses, Hastings and Randolph offered to sell the company to Blockbuster LLC for $50 million. John Antioco, CEO of Blockbuster, thought the offer was a joke and declined, saying, \"The dot-com hysteria is completely overblown.\"[41][42] While Netflix experienced fast growth in early 2001, the continued effects of the dot-com bubble collapse and the September 11 attacks caused the company to hold off plans for its initial public offering (IPO) and to lay off one-third of its 120 employees.[43]\nDVD players were a popular gift for holiday sales in late 2001, and demand for DVD subscription services were \"growing like crazy\", according to chief talent officer Patty McCord.[44] The company went public on May 29, 2002, selling 5.5\u00a0million shares of common stock at US$15.00 per share.[45] In 2003, Netflix was issued a patent by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office to cover its subscription rental service and several extensions.[46] Netflix posted its first profit in 2003, earning $6.5 million on revenues of $272 million; by 2004, profit had increased to $49 million on over $500 million in revenues.[47] In 2005, 35,000 different films were available, and Netflix shipped 1\u00a0million DVDs out every day.[48]\nIn 2004, Blockbuster introduced a DVD rental service, which not only allowed users to check out titles through online sites but allowed for them to return them at brick-and-mortar stores.[49] By 2006, Blockbuster's service reached two million users, and while trailing Netflix's subscriber count, was drawing business away from Netflix. Netflix lowered fees in 2007.[47] While it was an urban legend that Netflix ultimately \"killed\" Blockbuster in the DVD rental market, Blockbuster's debt load and internal disagreements hurt the company.[49]\nOn April 4, 2006, Netflix filed a patent infringement lawsuit in which it demanded a jury trial in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that Blockbuster LLC's online DVD rental subscription program violated two patents held by Netflix. The first cause of action alleged Blockbuster's infringement of copying the \"dynamic queue\" of DVDs available for each customer, Netflix's method of using the ranked preferences in the queue to send DVDs to subscribers, and Netflix's method permitting the queue to be updated and reordered.[50] The second cause of action alleged infringement of the subscription rental service as well as Netflix's methods of communication and delivery.[51] The companies settled their dispute on June 25, 2007; terms were not disclosed.[52][53][54][55]\nOn October 1, 2006, Netflix announced the Netflix Prize, $1,000,000 to the first developer of a video-recommendation algorithm that could beat its existing algorithm Cinematch, at predicting customer ratings by more than 10%. On September 21, 2009, it awarded the $1,000,000 prize to team \"BellKor\u2019s Pragmatic Chaos.\"[56] Cinematch, launched in 2000, is a recommendation system that recommended movies to its users, many of which they might not ever had heard of before.[57][58]\nThrough its division Red Envelope Entertainment, Netflix licensed and distributed independent films such as Born into Brothels and Sherrybaby. In late 2006, Red Envelope Entertainment also expanded into producing original content with filmmakers such as John Waters.[59] Netflix closed Red Envelope Entertainment in 2008.[60][61]\nIn January 2007, the company launched a streaming media service, introducing video on demand via the Internet. However, at that time it only had 1,000 films available for streaming, compared to 70,000 available on DVD.[62] The company had for some time considered offering movies online, but it was only in the mid-2000s that data speeds and bandwidth costs had improved sufficiently to allow customers to download movies from the net. The original idea was a \"Netflix box\" that could download movies overnight, and be ready to watch the next day. By 2005, Netflix had acquired movie rights and designed the box and service. But after witnessing how popular streaming services such as YouTube were despite the lack of high-definition content, the concept of using a hardware device was scrapped and replaced with a streaming concept.[63]\nIn February 2007, Netflix delivered its billionth DVD, a copy of Babel to a customer in Texas.[64][65] In April 2007, Netflix recruited ReplayTV founder Anthony Wood, to build a \"Netflix Player\" that would allow streaming content to be played directly on a television rather than a desktop or laptop.[66] Hastings eventually shut down the project to help encourage other hardware manufacturers to include built-in Netflix support, which would be spun off as the digital media player product Roku.[67][68][69]\nIn January 2008, all rental-disc subscribers became entitled to unlimited streaming at no additional cost. This change came in a response to the introduction of Hulu and to Apple's new video-rental services.[70][71][page\u00a0needed] In August 2008, the Netflix database was corrupted and the company was not able to ship DVDs to customers for 3 days, leading the company to move all its data to the Amazon Web Services cloud.[72] In November 2008, Netflix began offering subscribers rentals on Blu-ray and discontinued its sale of used DVDs.[73] In 2009, Netflix streams overtook DVD shipments.[74]\nOn January 6, 2010, Netflix agreed with Warner Bros. to delay new release rentals 28 days prior to retail, in an attempt to help studios sell physical copies, and similar deals involving Universal Pictures and 20th Century Fox were reached on April 9.[75][76][77] In July 2010, Netflix signed a deal to stream movies of Relativity Media.[78] In August 2010, Netflix reached a five-year deal worth nearly $1\u00a0billion to stream films from Paramount, Lionsgate and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The deal increased Netflix's annual spending fees, adding roughly $200\u00a0million per year. It spent $117\u00a0million in the first six months of 2010 on streaming, up from $31\u00a0million in 2009.[79] On September 22, 2010, Netflix launched in Canada, its first international market.[80][81] In November 2010, Netflix began offering a standalone streaming service separate from DVD rentals.[82]\nIn 2010, Netflix acquired the rights to Breaking Bad, produced by Sony Pictures Television, after the show's third season, at a point where original broadcaster AMC had expressed the possibility of cancelling the show. Sony pushed Netflix to release Breaking Bad in time for the fourth season, which as a result, greatly expanded the show's audience on AMC due to new viewers binging on the Netflix past episodes, and doubling the viewership by the time of the fifth season. Breaking Bad is considered the first such show to have this \"Netflix effect.\"[83]\nIn January 2011, Netflix announced agreements with several manufacturers to include branded Netflix buttons on the remote controls of devices compatible with the service, such as Blu-ray players.[84] By May 2011, Netflix had become the largest source of Internet streaming traffic in North America, accounting for 30% of traffic during peak hours.[85][86][87][88]\nOn July 12, 2011, Netflix announced that it would separate its existing subscription plans into two separate plans: one covering the streaming and the other DVD rental services.[89][90] The cost for streaming would be $7.99 per month, while DVD rental would start at the same price.[91] In September 2011, Netflix announced a content deal with DreamWorks Animation.[92] In September 2011, Netflix expanded to 43 countries in Latin America.[93][94][95] On September 18, 2011, Netflix announced its intentions to rebrand and restructure its DVD home media rental service as an independent subsidiary called Qwikster, separating DVD rental and streaming services.[96][97][98][99][100] On October 10, 2011, Netflix announced that it would retain its DVD service under the name Netflix and that its streaming and DVD-rental plans would remain branded together.[101][102]\nOn January 4, 2012, Netflix started its expansion to Europe, launching in the United Kingdom and Ireland.[103] In February 2012, Netflix reached a multi-year agreement with The Weinstein Company.[104][105] In March 2012, Netflix acquired the domain name DVD.com.[106] By 2016, Netflix rebranded its DVD-by-mail service under the name DVD.com, A Netflix Company.[107][108] In April 2012, Netflix filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to form a political action committee (PAC) called FLIXPAC.[109] Netflix spokesperson Joris Evers tweeted that the intent was to \"engage on issues like net neutrality, bandwidth caps, UBB and VPPA\".[110][111] In June 2012, Netflix signed a deal with Open Road Films.[112][113]\nOn August 23, 2012, Netflix and The Weinstein Company signed a multi-year output deal for RADiUS-TWC films.[114][115] In September 2012, Epix signed a five-year streaming deal with Netflix. For the initial two years of this agreement, first-run and back-catalog content from Epix was exclusive to Netflix. Epix films came to Netflix 90 days after premiering on Epix.[116] These included films from Paramount, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Lionsgate.[117][118]\nOn October 18, 2012, Netflix launched in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden.[119][120] On December 4, 2012, Netflix and Disney announced an exclusive multi-year agreement for first-run United States subscription television rights to Walt Disney Studios' animated and live-action films, with classics such as Dumbo, Alice in Wonderland and Pocahontas available immediately and others available on Netflix beginning in 2016.[121] Direct-to-video releases were made available in 2013.[122][123]\nOn January 14, 2013, Netflix signed an agreement with Time Warner's Turner Broadcasting System and Warner Bros. Television to distribute Cartoon Network, Warner Bros. Animation, and Adult Swim content, as well as TNT's Dallas, beginning in March 2013. The rights to these programs were given to Netflix shortly after deals with Viacom to stream Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. programs expired.[124]\nFor cost reasons, Netflix stated that it would limit its expansion in 2013,[125] adding only one new market\u2014the Netherlands\u2014in September of that year. This expanded its availability to 40 territories.[126][127]\nNetflix began efforts to develop original content in 2011; in March, Netflix made a straight-to-series order for the Kevin Spacey-led political drama House of Cards from MRC. Beating out other U.S. cable networks, it marked the first first-run television series to be specifically commissioned by the service.[128] In November 2011, Netflix then ordered Orange is the New Black, a comedy-drama adapted from Piper Kerman's memoir of the same name,[129] and a new season of the cancelled Fox sitcom Arrested Development.[130] Netflix also acquired U.S. rights to the Norwegian drama Lilyhammer; following its television premiere on Norway's NRK1 on January 25, 2012, the entirety of its first season was released by Netflix on February 8\u2014a notable departure from the broadcast television model of premiering episodes on a weekly basis.[131][132]\nHouse of Cards was released by Netflix on February 1, 2013, marketed as the first \"Netflix Original\" production.[133] Later that month, Netflix announced an agreement with DreamWorks Animation to commission children's television series based on its properties, beginning with Turbo: F.A.S.T., a spin-off of its film Turbo.[134][135] Orange is the New Black would premiere in July 2013;  Netflix stated that Orange is the New Black had been its most-watched original series so far, with all of them having \"an audience comparable with successful shows on cable and broadcast TV.\"[136][137]\nOn March 13, 2013, Netflix added a Facebook sharing feature, letting United States subscribers access \"Watched by your friends\" and \"Friends' Favorites\" by agreeing.[138] This was not legal until the Video Privacy Protection Act was modified in early 2013.[139] On August 1, 2013, Netflix reintroduced the \"Profiles\" feature that permits accounts to accommodate up to five user profiles.[140][141][142][143]\nIn November 2013, Marvel Television and ABC Studios announced Netflix had ordered a slate of four television series based on the Marvel Comics characters Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist and Luke Cage. Each of the four series received an initial order of 13 episodes, and Netflix also ordered a Defenders miniseries that would tie them together.

Films distributed by the streamer received a total of 72 nominations.[444] Campion became the third female to receive the Best Director award, winning her second Oscar for The Power of the Dog.[445] At the 50th International Emmy Awards in November 2022, Netflix original Sex Education won Best Comedy Series.[446]\nNetflix has been subject to criticism from various groups and individuals as its popularity and market reach increased in the 2010s.\nCustomers have complained about price increases in Netflix offerings dating back to the company's decision to separate its DVD rental and streaming services, which was quickly reversed. As Netflix increased its streaming output, it has faced calls to limit accessibility to graphic content and include viewer advisories for issues such as sensationalism and promotion of pseudoscience. Netflix's content has also been criticized by disability rights advocates for lack of captioning quality.[447]\nSome media organizations and competitors have criticized Netflix for selectively releasing ratings and viewer numbers of its original programming. The company has made claims boasting about viewership records without providing data to substantiate its successes or using problematic estimation methods.[448] In March 2020, some government agencies called for Netflix and other streamers to limit services due to increased broadband and energy consumption as use of the platform increased. In response, the company announced it would reduce bit rates across all streams in Europe, thus decreasing Netflix traffic on European networks by around 25 percent. These same steps were later taken in India.[citation needed]\nIn May 2022, Netflix's shareholder Imperium Irrevocable Trust filed a lawsuit against the company for violating the U.S. securities laws.[449]", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix#cite_ref-vulture_squid_game_209-1", " https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/netflix#bodyContent", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page",

EPB began serving their customers in 1939.[9]\nEPB is providing its gigabit internet service in Chattanooga Airport, where visitors enjoy free high-speed Wi-Fi service. They set up a demonstration area in the former gift shop. EPB also provides free high-speed Wi-Fi in Miller Plaza.[19] EPB is one of the largest providers of electric power in the US.[20] EPB has petitioned the FCC to allow them to deliver internet to communities outside of the 600 square mile area that they service. Nineteen states in the US have laws that make it difficult or impossible for utility companies to deliver internet outside of the area that they service.[21]\nIn February 2008, the EPB Board of Directors approved a plan to construct a Smart Grid, an advanced, automated, self-healing smart grid electrical distribution system, using a 100% fiber optic communication network as its backbone.[22][23]\nIn September 2010, EPB completed the construction of a 9,000-mile community-wide, 100% fiber optic network. As a result, EPB became the first connectivity provider in the United States to offer one gigabit-per-second (1,000 Mbit/s) internet speed to more than 175,000 homes and businesses.[24] This has attracted worldwide attention and earned Chattanooga the nickname \"Gig City.\"[4]\nThe development of Chattanooga's Smart Grid completed in April 2012 with the installation of more than 200,000 sensors and smart devices, including the deployment of about 1,200 automated smart switches and other advanced power management equipment throughout the system. The initial build-out was completed in four years instead of the expected ten years.[25]\nIn September 2013, EPB increased its starting speed to 100 Mbit/s with no additional charge to current customers.[26] In 2019, EPB raised its starting speed to 300 Mbit/s.[27]\nIn October 2014, EPB established a partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy and Oak Ridge National Laboratory to use Chattanooga's smart grid to test and develop new energy technologies.[28]\nIn October 2018, EPB joined with other community partners in the launch of the Chattanooga Smart Cities Community Collaborative, a joint effort to utilize the Chattanooga area's smart city infrastructure and other expertise and assets in the service of smart city research, including the establishment of a mile-long Smart City Testbed Corridor by the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga's Center for Urban Informatics and Progress.[29][30][31] As a result of research efforts completed by members of the Chattanooga Smart Cities Collaborative, Chattanooga was named an IDC Smart City in 2020 for a project to predict hotspots for traffic accidents and address them.[32] U.S. Ignite, a national innovation group led by the NSF and the OSTP, also recognized Chattanooga with a Smart 50 Award in 2019.[33]\nIn July 2020, EPB and its community partners announced HCS EdConnect, a program to provide the families of all economically challenged K\u201312 students with high-speed internet and a wireless router at no charge. The program was designed to ensure internet access for all K\u201312 students in need for at least ten years, with plans to raise the funding necessary to continue the program indefinitely.[34]\nIn January 2021, an independent study conducted by Bento Lobo, Ph.D. of the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, documented $2.69 billion in benefits to the community during the first ten years after EPB built the community-wide fiber optic network and advanced smart grid.[35] According to the study, the implementation of EPB's fiber optic system has helped generate an estimated 9,516 jobs and $244 million in business ventures using the fiber optic network.\"[36]\nAccording to Dr. Bento Lobo's study in 2021, the construction of Chattanooga's smart grid helped avoid 7,900 tons of CO2 emissions from 2014 to 2020 by allowing a significant reduction in road miles driven as well as enhanced power demand management and power factor improvement.[37]\nIn 2015, EPB partnered with TVA and other partners to provide home energy renovations at no charge to economically challenged homeowners through what is now called the \"Home Uplift\" program. In April 2021, EPB and its partners announced the completion of its 400th \"Home Uplift.\" According to third-party analysis, each of the 400 homes saves 5,206 kWh on average each year which equates to more than $208,000 in total savings to customers and the avoidance of 1,472 metric tons of carbon emissions.[38]\nIn July 2017, EPB completed the construction of Solar Share, Chattanooga's first and only community solar installation.[39] The facility consists of 4,408 solar panels that can generate 1.3 megawatts of solar power, which is enough to meet the average energy needs of 130 homes.[40]\nIn October 2019, EPB's Solar Share community solar installation powered the 3rd International Placemaking Week Conference, making it Chattanooga's first conference with net-zero carbon.[41]\nIn November 2019, EPB earned the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification at the Gold level for an existing building.[42] The certification reflects EPB's success in dramatically reducing its environmental impact through energy efficiency, reduced water use, diverting waste from landfills through composting and recycling, and other measures.[43]\nAs part of the government-owned infrastructure in Chattanooga, EPB functions as one of the community's first responders to ensure uninterrupted fiber optic and electric power service in the event of natural disasters.[44]\nOn April 12, 2020, the Easter tornado outbreak that took place in the Chattanooga area disrupted the electric and fiber optic grids. More than 106,000 EPB customers lost power initially, with 44,000 regaining power within hours from Chattanooga's smart grid automatic processing. EPB leveraged mutual aid agreements to bring more than 1,500 utility workers from eight states to restore services for the remaining affected customers. In addition to the utility crews, EPB office employees also assisted by volunteering to distribute food and protective gear and coordinate the staging of reconstruction materials.[45]\nWhen COVID-19 began in 2020, EPB provided community support through in-kind services and financial support, suspending disconnections and waiving late fees to ensure their customers could maintain connectivity, in addition to installing more than 130 Wi-Fi hotspots in publicly accessible areas and housing developments.[46] In July 2020, EPB joined Hamilton County Schools in launching HCS Ed Connect to provide home-based internet to all K-12 students and their families at no charge.[47] Although HCS EdConnect ensured that students could continue their studies remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic was the initial impetus for the program,  it originally was designed to remain available to eligible families indefinitely so that it could serve as a lasting solution for bridging the digital divide for students in Hamilton County.[48]\nEPB engaged TVA in matching donations to United Way of Greater Chattanooga's Restore Hope Fund to support individuals and families experiencing financial strain due to COVID-19, resulting in a total contribution of more than $785,000.[49]\nIn November 2020, EPB donated 5,000 face coverings to help local students and teachers stay safe amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The donation of the face coverings benefitted five schools located in Hamilton County and was initiated by an Economic Recovery Group commissioned by Tennessee state Governor, Bill Lee.[50]", "links":

To Its Own CDN; Akamai, Limelight Shrs Hit": {"text": "Netflix disclosed in a blog post Monday that the company is shifting more of its streaming video traffic to Open Connect, a \"single purpose Netflix content delivery network\" the company is building. The company noted that it will continue to work with commercial CDNs for the next few years, but that \"eventually most of our data will be served by Open Connect.\"\nNetflix noted that about 5% of its traffic is already being served by Open Connect.\nNetflix said that as part of the project it is sharing its hardware design and the open source software components of the server used in the project. \"These cost-efficient designs are suitable for any high-volume provider of large media files,\" Netflix said. \"We welcome commentary and improvements, which will be shared with the community with the goal of a faster, less expensive Internet for all.\"\nIn a research note this morning, Jefferies analyst Aaron Schwartz noted that Netflix is one of the few Internet content providers with enough traffic to make a private CDN worthwhile. He also noted that the news is likely to pressure shares of the publicly traded CDN stocks.\n\"The Open Connect CDN platform will serve to reduce NFLX\u2019s reliance (and associated costs) on commercial CDNs,\" he writes. \"Netflix is often measured as one of the largest sources of Internet traffic and is one of a handful of companies (in addition to Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft, etc.) that have the required traffic levels, and business case, to warrant bringing CDN capabilities in house. We expect near term weakness in the commercial CDN vendors including Akamai, Limleight and Level 3 and expect the focus to fall to Limelight given customer concentration, as Netflix accounted for 11% of Limelight\u2019s revenue in 2011.\"\nIn this morning's trading:\nUpdate: The stock are taking a bigger hit now that the regular session has started:", "links": ["https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericsavitz/2012/06/05/netflix-shifts-traffic-to-its-own-cdn-akamai-limelight-shrs-hit/", "https://www.forbes.com/", "https://account.forbes.com/subscribe?eventSource=header&redirect=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericsavitz/2012/06/05/netflix-shifts-traffic-to-its-own-cdn-akamai-limelight-shrs-hit/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/markgibbs/2013/07/23/defkalion-demonstrates-lenr-live-right-now/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/markgibbs/2013/07/23/defkalion-demonstrates-lenr-live-right-now/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/markgibbs/2013/07/15/why-cold-fusion-has-to-die/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/markgibbs/2013/07/15/why-cold-fusion-has-to-die/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/markgibbs/2013/07/12/news-station-ktuv-punkd-over-asiana-aircraft-pilots-names/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/markgibbs/2013/07/12/news-station-ktuv-punkd-over-asiana-aircraft-pilots-names/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/markgibbs/2013/07/09/us-economic-development-administration-fixes-malware-infection-destroys-everything-mice-included/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/markgibbs/2013/07/09/us-economic-development-administration-fixes-malware-infection-destroys-everything-mice-included/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/markgibbs/2013/06/27/how-civilization-as-we-know-it-could-end-with-a-cough/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/markgibbs/2013/06/27/how-civilization-as-we-know-it-could-end-with-a-cough/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/markgibbs/2013/06/15/psstt-want-an-e-cat-lenr-generator-for-free/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/markgibbs/2013/06/15/psstt-want-an-e-cat-lenr-generator-for-free/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/markgibbs/2013/05/30/rossis-a-fraud-no-hes-not-yes-he-is-no-he-isnt/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/markgibbs/2013/05/30/rossis-a-fraud-no-hes-not-yes-he-is-no-he-isnt/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/markgibbs/2013/05/24/the-e-cat-testing-team-real-or-ringers/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/markgibbs/2013/05/24/the-e-cat-testing-team-real-or-ringers/", "https://bertie.forbes.com/#/compose?id=4fce019176e4cfca294cdd8a", "https://en.wikipedia.org/cio-network/old", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericsavitz/", "http://blogs-images.forbes.com/ericsavitz/files/2012/06/Netflix-logo.jpg", "http://finapps.forbes.com/finapps/jsp/finance/compinfo/CIAtAGlance.jsp?tkr=nflx", "http://blog.netflix.com/2012/06/announcing-netflix-open-connect-network.html", " https:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/openconnect.netflix.com", "https://netflix.hs.llnwd.net/e1/us/layout/signup/deviceinfo/OpenConnectDeploymentGuide-v2.4a.pdf", "http://finapps.forbes.com/finapps/jsp/finance/compinfo/CIAtAGlance.jsp?tkr=akam", "http://finapps.forbes.com/finapps/jsp/finance/compinfo/CIAtAGlance.jsp?tkr=llnw", "http://finapps.forbes.com/finapps/jsp/finance/compinfo/CIAtAGlance.jsp?tkr=lvlt", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericsavitz/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericsavitz/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesstaff/article/forbes-editorial-values-and-standards/", "https://www.parsintl.com/publication/forbes/", "https://www.forbes.com/"]}}
