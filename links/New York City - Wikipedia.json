{"New York City - Wikipedia": {"text": "New York, often called New York City[a] or NYC, is the most populous city in the United States. With a 2020 population of 8,804,190 distributed over 300.46 square miles (778.2\u00a0km2), New York City is the most densely populated major city in the United States and more than twice as populous as Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest city. New York City is located at the southern tip of New York State. It constitutes the geographical and demographic center of both the Northeast megalopolis and the New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the U.S. by both population and urban area. With over 20.1 million people in its metropolitan statistical area and 23.5 million in its combined statistical area as of 2020, New York is one of the world's most populous megacities, and over 58 million people live within 250\u00a0mi (400\u00a0km) of the city.[10] New York City is a global cultural, financial, entertainment, and media center with a significant influence on commerce, health care and life sciences,[11] research, technology, education, politics, tourism, dining, art, fashion, and sports. Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy,[12][13] and is sometimes described as the capital of the world.[14][15]\nSituated on one of the world's largest natural harbors and extending into the Atlantic Ocean, New York City comprises five boroughs, each of which is coextensive with a respective county of the state of New York. The five boroughs, which were created in 1898 when local governments were consolidated into a single municipal entity, are: Brooklyn (in Kings County), Queens (in Queens County), Manhattan (in New York County), The Bronx (in Bronx County), and Staten Island (in Richmond County).[16]\nAs of 2021[update], the New York metropolitan area is the largest metropolitan economy in the world with a gross metropolitan product of over $2.4\u00a0trillion. If the New York metropolitan area were a sovereign state, it would have the eighth-largest economy in the world. New York City is an established safe haven for global investors.[17] New York is home to the highest number of billionaires,[18][19] individuals of ultra-high net worth (greater than US$30 million),[20] and millionaires[21] of any city in the world.\nThe city and its metropolitan area constitute the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York,[22] making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. New York City is home to more than 3.2 million residents born outside the U.S., the largest foreign-born population of any city in the world as of 2016.[23]\nNew York City traces its origins to a trading post founded on the southern tip of Manhattan Island by Dutch colonists in approximately 1624. The settlement was named New Amsterdam (Dutch: Nieuw Amsterdam) in 1626 and was chartered as a city in 1653. The city came under British control in 1664 and was renamed New York after King Charles\u00a0II of England granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York.[24][25] The city was regained by the Dutch in July 1673 and was renamed New Orange for one year and three months; the city has been continuously named New York since November 1674. New York City was the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790,[26] and has been the largest U.S. city since 1790. The Statue of Liberty greeted millions of immigrants as they came to the U.S. by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and is a symbol of the U.S. and its ideals of liberty and peace.[27] In the 21st century, New York City has emerged as a global node of creativity, entrepreneurship,[28] and as a symbol of freedom and cultural diversity.[29] The New York Times has won the most Pulitzer Prizes for journalism and remains the U.S. media's \"newspaper of record\".[30] In 2019, New York City was voted the greatest city in the world in a survey of over 30,000 people from 48 cities worldwide, citing its cultural diversity.[31]\nMany districts and monuments in New York City are major landmarks, including three of the world's ten most visited tourist attractions in 2013.[32] A record 66.6\u00a0million tourists visited New York City in 2019. Times Square is the brightly illuminated hub of the Broadway Theater District,[33] one of the world's busiest pedestrian intersections[32] and a major center of the world's entertainment industry.[34] Many of the city's landmarks, skyscrapers, and parks are known around the world, and the city's fast pace led to the phrase New York minute. The Empire State Building is a global standard of reference to describe the height and length of other structures.[35]\nManhattan's real estate market is among the most expensive in the world.[36][37] Providing continuous 24/7 service and contributing to the nickname The City That Never Sleeps, the New York City Subway is the largest single-operator rapid transit system in the world with 472 passenger rail stations, and Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan is the busiest transportation hub in the Western Hemisphere.[38] The city has over 120 colleges and universities, including Columbia University, an Ivy League university routinely ranked among the world's top universities,[39] New York University, and the City University of New York system, the largest urban public university system in the nation. Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York City has been called both the world's leading financial and fintech center[40] and the most economically powerful city in the world,[41] and is home to the world's two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization, the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.[42][43]\nThe Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village, part of the Stonewall National Monument, is considered the historic epicenter of LGBTQ+ culture[44] and the birthplace of the modern gay rights movement.[45][46] New York City is the headquarters of the global art market, with numerous art galleries and auction houses collectively hosting half of the world\u2019s art auctions, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art is both the largest art museum and the most visited museum in the United States.[47] Governors Island in New York Harbor is planned to host a US$1\u00a0billion research and education center as a leader the climate crisis.[48]\nIn 1664, New York was named in honor of the Duke of York, who would become King James\u00a0II of England.[49] James's elder brother, King Charles\u00a0II, appointed the Duke as proprietor of the former territory of New Netherland, including the city of New Amsterdam, when England seized it from Dutch control.[50]\nIn the pre-Columbian era, the area of present-day New York City was inhabited by Algonquian Native Americans, including the Lenape. Their homeland, known as Lenapehoking, included the present-day areas of Staten Island, Manhattan, the Bronx, the western portion of Long Island (including the areas that would later become the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens), and the Lower Hudson Valley.[51]\nThe first documented visit into New York Harbor by a European was in 1524 by Italian Giovanni da\u00a0Verrazzano, an explorer from Florence in the service of the French crown.[52] He claimed the area for France and named it Nouvelle Angoul\u00eame (New Angoul\u00eame).[53] A Spanish expedition, led by the Portuguese captain Est\u00eav\u00e3o Gomes sailing for Emperor Charles\u00a0V, arrived in New York Harbor in January 1525 and charted the mouth of the Hudson River, which he named R\u00edo de San Antonio ('Saint Anthony's River'). The Padr\u00f3n Real of 1527, the first scientific map to show the East Coast of North America continuously, was informed by Gomes' expedition and labeled the northeastern United States as Tierra de Esteban G\u00f3mez in his honor.[54]\nIn 1609, the English explorer Henry Hudson rediscovered New York Harbor while searching for the Northwest Passage to the Orient for the Dutch East India Company.[55] He proceeded to sail up what the Dutch would name the North River (now the Hudson River), named first by Hudson as the Mauritius after Maurice, Prince of Orange. Hudson's first mate described the harbor as \"a very good Harbour for all windes\" and the river as \"a mile broad\" and \"full of fish\".[56] Hudson sailed roughly 150 miles (240\u00a0km) north,[57] past the site of the present-day New York State capital city of Albany, in the belief that it might be an oceanic tributary before the river became too shallow to continue.[56] He made a ten-day exploration of the area and claimed the region for the Dutch East India Company. In 1614, the area between Cape Cod and Delaware Bay was claimed by the Netherlands and called Nieuw-Nederland ('New Netherland').\nThe first non\u2013Native American inhabitant of what would eventually become New York City was Juan Rodriguez (transliterated to the Dutch language as Jan Rodrigues), a merchant from Santo Domingo. Born in Santo Domingo of Portuguese and African descent, he arrived in Manhattan during the winter of 1613\u201314, trapping for pelts and trading with the local population as a representative of the Dutch. Broadway, from 159th Street to 218th Street in Upper Manhattan, is named Juan Rodriguez Way in his honor.[58][59]\nA permanent European presence near New York Harbor was established in 1624, making New York the 12th-oldest continuously occupied European-established settlement in the continental United States[60]\u2014with the founding of a Dutch fur trading settlement on Governors Island. In 1625, construction was started on a citadel and Fort Amsterdam, later called Nieuw Amsterdam (New Amsterdam), on present-day Manhattan Island.[61][62] The colony of New Amsterdam was centered on what would ultimately be known as Lower Manhattan. Its area extended from the southern tip of Manhattan to modern day Wall Street, where a 12-foot wooden stockade was built in 1653 to protect against Native American and British raids.[63] In 1626, the Dutch colonial Director-General Peter Minuit, acting as charged by the Dutch West India Company, purchased the island of Manhattan from the Canarsie, a small Lenape band,[64] for \"the value of 60 guilders\"[65] (about $900 in 2018).[66] A disproved legend claims that Manhattan was purchased for $24 worth of glass beads.[67][68]\nFollowing the purchase, New Amsterdam grew slowly.[25] To attract settlers, the Dutch instituted the patroon system in 1628, whereby wealthy Dutchmen (patroons, or patrons) who brought 50 colonists to New Netherland would be awarded swaths of land, along with local political autonomy and rights to participate in the lucrative fur trade. This program had little success.[69]\nSince 1621, the Dutch West India Company had operated as a monopoly in New Netherland, on authority granted by the Dutch States General. In 1639\u20131640, in an effort to bolster economic growth, the Dutch West India Company relinquished its monopoly over the fur trade, leading to growth in the production and trade of food, timber, tobacco, and slaves (particularly with the Dutch West Indies).[25][70]\nIn 1647, Peter Stuyvesant began his tenure as the last Director-General of New Netherland. During his tenure, the population of New Netherland grew from 2,000 to 8,000.[71][72] Stuyvesant has been credited with improving law and order in the colony; however, he also earned a reputation as a despotic leader. He instituted regulations on liquor sales, attempted to assert control over the Dutch Reformed Church, and blocked other religious groups (including Quakers, Jews, and Lutherans) from establishing houses of worship.[73] The Dutch West India Company would eventually attempt to ease tensions between Stuyvesant and residents of New Amsterdam.[74]\nIn 1664, unable to summon any significant resistance, Stuyvesant surrendered New Amsterdam to English troops, led by Colonel Richard Nicolls, without bloodshed.[73][74] The terms of the surrender permitted Dutch residents to remain in the colony and allowed for religious freedom.[75] In 1667, during negotiations leading to the Treaty of Breda after the Second Anglo-Dutch War, the Dutch decided to keep the nascent plantation colony of what is now Suriname (on the northern South American coast) they had gained from the English; and in return, the English kept New Amsterdam. The fledgling settlement was promptly renamed \"New York\" after the Duke of York (the future King James II and VII), who would eventually be deposed in the Glorious Revolution.[76] After the founding, the duke gave part of the colony to proprietors George Carteret and John Berkeley. Fort Orange, 150 miles (240\u00a0km) north on the Hudson River, was renamed Albany after James's Scottish title.[77] The transfer was confirmed in 1667 by the Treaty of Breda, which concluded the Second Anglo-Dutch War.[78]\nOn August 24, 1673, during the Third Anglo-Dutch War, Dutch captain Anthony Colve seized the colony of New York from the English at the behest of Cornelis Evertsen the Youngest and rechristened it \"New Orange\" after William\u00a0III, the Prince of Orange.[79] The Dutch would soon return the island to England under the Treaty of Westminster of November 1674.[80][81]\nSeveral intertribal wars among the Native Americans and some epidemics brought on by contact with the Europeans caused sizeable population losses for the Lenape between the years 1660 and 1670.[82] By 1700, the Lenape population had diminished to 200.[83] New York experienced several yellow fever epidemics in the 18th century, losing ten percent of its population to the disease in 1702 alone.[84][85]\nIn the early 18th century, New York grew in importance as a trading port while as a part of the colony of New York.[86] It also became a center of slavery, with 42% of households enslaving Africans by 1730, the highest percentage outside Charleston, South Carolina.[87] Most cases were that of domestic slavery, as a New York household then commonly enslaved few or several people. Others were hired out to work at labor. Slavery became integrally tied to New York's economy through the labor of slaves throughout the port, and the banking and shipping industries trading with the American South. During construction in Foley Square in the 1990s, the African Burying Ground was discovered; the cemetery included 10,000 to 20,000 of graves of colonial-era Africans, some enslaved and some free.[88]\nThe 1735 trial and acquittal in Manhattan of John Peter Zenger, who had been accused of seditious libel after criticizing colonial governor William Cosby, helped to establish the freedom of the press in North America.[89] In 1754, Columbia University was founded under charter by King George II as King's College in Lower Manhattan.[90]\nThe Stamp Act Congress met in New York in October 1765, as the Sons of Liberty organization emerged in the city and skirmished over the next ten years with British troops stationed there.[91] The Battle of Long Island, the largest battle of the American Revolutionary War, was fought in August 1776 within the modern-day borough of Brooklyn.[92] After the battle, in which the Americans were defeated, the British made the city their military and political base of operations in North America. The city was a haven for Loyalist refugees and escaped slaves who joined the British lines for freedom newly promised by the Crown for all fighters. As many as 10,000 escaped slaves crowded into the city during the British occupation. When the British forces evacuated at the close of the war in 1783, they transported 3,000 freedmen for resettlement in Nova Scotia.[93] They resettled other freedmen in England and the Caribbean.\nThe only attempt at a peaceful solution to the war took place at the Conference House on Staten Island between American delegates, including Benjamin Franklin, and British general Lord Howe on September 11, 1776. Shortly after the British occupation began, the Great Fire of New York occurred, a large conflagration on the West Side of Lower Manhattan, which destroyed about a quarter of the buildings in the city, including Trinity Church.[94]\nIn 1785, the assembly of the Congress of the Confederation made New York City the national capital shortly after the war. New York was the last capital of the U.S. under the Articles of Confederation and the first capital under the Constitution of the United States. New York City as the U.S. capital hosted several events of national scope in 1789\u2014the first President of the United States, George Washington, was inaugurated; the first United States Congress and the Supreme Court of the United States each assembled for the first time; and the United States Bill of Rights was drafted, all at Federal Hall on Wall Street.[95] In 1790, New York surpassed Philadelphia as the nation's largest city. At the end of that year, pursuant to the Residence Act, the national capital was moved to Philadelphia.[96][97]\nOver the course of the nineteenth century, New York City's population grew from 60,000 to 3.43\u00a0million.[99] Under New York State's abolition act of 1799, children of slave mothers were to be eventually liberated but to be held in indentured servitude until their mid-to-late twenties.[100][101] Together with slaves freed by their masters after the Revolutionary War and escaped slaves, a significant free-Black population gradually developed in Manhattan. Under such influential United States founders as Alexander Hamilton and John Jay, the New York Manumission Society worked for abolition and established the African Free School to educate Black children.[102] It was not until 1827 that slavery was completely abolished in the state, and free Blacks struggled afterward with discrimination. New York interracial abolitionist activism continued; among its leaders were graduates of the African Free School. New York city's population jumped from 123,706 in 1820 to 312,710 by 1840, 16,000 of whom were Black.[103][104]\nIn the 19th century, the city was transformed by both commercial and residential development relating to its status as a national and international trading center, as well as by European immigration, respectively.[105] The city adopted the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, which expanded the city street grid to encompass almost all of Manhattan. The 1825 completion of the Erie Canal through central New York connected the Atlantic port to the agricultural markets and commodities of the North American interior via the Hudson River and the Great Lakes.[106] Local politics became dominated by Tammany Hall, a political machine supported by Irish and German immigrants.[107]\nSeveral prominent American literary figures lived in New York during the 1830s and 1840s, including William Cullen Bryant, Washington Irving, Herman Melville, Rufus Wilmot Griswold, John Keese, Nathaniel Parker Willis, and Edgar Allan Poe. Public-minded members of the contemporaneous business elite lobbied for the establishment of Central Park, which in 1857 became the first landscaped park in an American city.\nThe Great Irish Famine brought a large influx of Irish immigrants; more than 200,000 were living in New York by 1860, upwards of a quarter of the city's population.[108] There was also extensive immigration from the German provinces, where revolutions had disrupted societies, and Germans comprised another 25% of New York's population by 1860.[109]\nDemocratic Party candidates were consistently elected to local office, increasing the city's ties to the South and its dominant party. In 1861, Mayor Fernando Wood called upon the aldermen to declare independence from Albany and the United States after the South seceded, but his proposal was not acted on.[102] Anger at new military conscription laws during the American Civil War (1861\u20131865), which spared wealthier men who could afford to pay a $300 (equivalent to $6,602 in 2021) commutation fee to hire a substitute,[110] led to the Draft Riots of 1863, whose most visible participants were ethnic Irish working class.[102]\nThe draft riots deteriorated into attacks on New York's elite, followed by attacks on Black New Yorkers and their property after fierce competition for a decade between Irish immigrants and Black people for work. Rioters burned the Colored Orphan Asylum to the ground, with more than 200 children escaping harm due to efforts of the New York Police Department, which was mainly made up of Irish immigrants.[109] At least 120 people were killed.[111] Eleven Black men were lynched over five days, and the riots forced hundreds of Blacks to flee the city for Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and New Jersey. The Black population in Manhattan fell below 10,000 by 1865, which it had last been in 1820. The White working class had established dominance.[109][111] Violence by longshoremen against Black men was especially fierce in the docks area.[109] It was one of the worst incidents of civil unrest in American history.[112]\nIn 1898, the City of New York was formed with the consolidation of Brooklyn (until then a separate city), the County of New York (which then included parts of the Bronx), the County of Richmond, and the western portion of the County of Queens.[113] The opening of the subway in 1904, first built as separate private systems, helped bind the new city together.[114] Throughout the first half of the 20th century, the city became a world center for industry, commerce, and communication.[115]\nIn 1904, the steamship General Slocum caught fire in the East River, killing 1,021 people on board.[119] In 1911, the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, the city's worst industrial disaster, took the lives of 146 garment workers and spurred the growth of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union and major improvements in factory safety standards.[120]\nNew York's non-White population was 36,620 in 1890.[121] New York City was a prime destination in the early twentieth century for African Americans during the Great Migration from the American South, and by 1916, New York City had become home to the largest urban African diaspora in North America.[122] The Harlem Renaissance of literary and cultural life flourished during the era of Prohibition.[123] The larger economic boom generated construction of skyscrapers competing in height and creating an identifiable skyline.\nNew York became the most populous urbanized area in the world in the early 1920s, overtaking London. The metropolitan area surpassed the 10\u00a0million mark in the early 1930s, becoming the first megacity in human history.[124] The Great Depression saw the election of reformer Fiorello La Guardia as mayor and the fall of Tammany Hall after eighty years of political dominance.[125]\nReturning World War II veterans created a post-war economic boom and the development of large housing tracts in eastern Queens and Nassau County as well as similar suburban areas in New Jersey. New York emerged from the war unscathed as the leading city of the world, with Wall Street leading America's place as the world's dominant economic power. The United Nations headquarters was completed in 1952, solidifying New York's global geopolitical influence, and the rise of abstract expressionism in the city precipitated New York's displacement of Paris as the center of the art world.[126]\nThe Stonewall riots were a series of spontaneous, violent protests by members of the gay community against a police raid that took place in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Lower Manhattan.[127] They are widely considered to constitute the single most important event leading to the gay liberation movement[116][128][129][130] and the modern fight for LGBT rights.[131][132] Wayne R. Dynes, author of the Encyclopedia of Homosexuality, wrote that drag queens were the only \"transgender folks around\" during the June 1969 Stonewall riots. The transgender community in New York City played a significant role in fighting for LGBT equality during the period of the Stonewall riots and thereafter.[133]\nIn the 1970s, job losses due to industrial restructuring caused New York City to suffer from economic problems and rising crime rates.[134] While a resurgence in the financial industry greatly improved the city's economic health in the 1980s, New York's crime rate continued to increase through that decade and into the beginning of the 1990s.[135] By the mid 1990s, crime rates started to drop dramatically due to revised police strategies, improving economic opportunities, gentrification, and new residents, both American transplants and new immigrants from Asia and Latin America. Important new sectors, such as Silicon Alley, emerged in the city's economy.[136]\nNew York's population reached all-time highs in the 2000 census and then again in the 2010 census.\nNew York City suffered the bulk of the economic damage and largest loss of human life in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks.[137] Two of the four airliners hijacked that day were flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Center, destroying the towers and killing 2,192 civilians, 343 firefighters, and 71 law enforcement officers. The North Tower became the tallest building ever to be destroyed anywhere then or subsequently.[138]\nThe area was rebuilt with a new One World Trade Center, a 9/11 memorial and museum, and other new buildings and infrastructure.[139] The World Trade Center PATH station, which had opened on July 19, 1909, as the Hudson Terminal, was also destroyed in the attacks. A temporary station was built and opened on November 23, 2003. An 800,000-square-foot (74,000\u00a0m2) permanent rail station designed by Santiago Calatrava, the World Trade Center Transportation Hub, the city's third-largest hub, was completed in 2016.[140] The new One World Trade Center is the tallest skyscraper in the Western Hemisphere[141] and the seventh-tallest building in the world by pinnacle height, with its spire reaching a symbolic 1,776 feet (541.3\u00a0m) in reference to the year of U.S. independence.[142][143][144][145]\nThe Occupy Wall Street protests in Zuccotti Park in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan began on September 17, 2011, receiving global attention and popularizing the Occupy movement against social and economic inequality worldwide.[146]\nNew York City was heavily affected by Hurricane Sandy in late October 2012. Sandy's impacts included the flooding of the New York City Subway system, of many suburban communities, and of all road tunnels entering Manhattan except the Lincoln Tunnel. The New York Stock Exchange closed for two consecutive days. Numerous homes and businesses were destroyed by fire, including over 100 homes in Breezy Point, Queens. Large parts of the city and surrounding areas lost electricity for several days. Several thousand people in Midtown Manhattan were evacuated for six days due to a crane collapse at Extell's One57. Bellevue Hospital Center and a few other large hospitals were closed and evacuated. Flooding at 140 West Street and another exchange disrupted voice and data communication in Lower Manhattan. At least 43 people lost their lives in New York City as a result of Sandy, and the economic losses in New York City were estimated to be roughly $19 billion. The disaster spawned long-term efforts towards infrastructural projects to counter climate change and rising seas.[147][148]\nIn March 2020, the first case of COVID-19 in the city was confirmed in Manhattan.[149] The city rapidly replaced Wuhan, China to become the global epicenter of the pandemic during the early phase, before the infection became widespread across the world and the rest of the nation. As of March 2021, New York City had recorded over 30,000 deaths from COVID-19-related complications. In 2022, the LGBT community in New York City became the epicenter of the monkeypox outbreak in the Western Hemisphere, prompting New York Governor Kathy Hochul and New York City Mayor Eric Adams declared corresponding public health emergencies in the state and city, respectively, in July 2022.[150]\nDuring the Wisconsin glaciation, 75,000 to 11,000 years ago, the New York City area was situated at the edge of a large ice sheet over 2,000 feet (610\u00a0m) in depth.[151] The erosive forward movement of the ice (and its subsequent retreat) contributed to the separation of what is now Long Island and Staten Island. That action also left bedrock at a relatively shallow depth, providing a solid foundation for most of Manhattan's skyscrapers.[152]\nNew York City is situated in the northeastern United States, in southeastern New York State, approximately halfway between Washington, D.C. and Boston. The location at the mouth of the Hudson River, which feeds into a naturally sheltered harbor and then into the Atlantic Ocean, has helped the city grow in significance as a trading port. Most of New York City is built on the three islands of Long Island, Manhattan, and Staten Island.\nThe Hudson River flows through the Hudson Valley into New York Bay. Between New York City and Troy, New York, the river is an estuary.[153] The Hudson River separates the city from the U.S. state of New Jersey. The East River\u2014a tidal strait\u2014flows from Long Island Sound and separates the Bronx and Manhattan from Long Island. The Harlem River, another tidal strait between the East and Hudson rivers, separates most of Manhattan from the Bronx. The Bronx River, which flows through the Bronx and Westchester County, is the only entirely freshwater river in the city.[154]\nThe city's land has been altered substantially by human intervention, with considerable land reclamation along the waterfronts since Dutch colonial times; reclamation is most prominent in Lower Manhattan, with developments such as Battery Park City in the 1970s and 1980s.[155] Some of the natural relief in topography has been evened out, especially in Manhattan.[156]\nThe city's total area is 468.484 square miles (1,213.37\u00a0km2); 302.643\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (783.84\u00a0km2) of the city is land and 165.841\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (429.53\u00a0km2) of this is water.[157][158] The highest point in the city is Todt Hill on Staten Island, which, at 409.8 feet (124.9\u00a0m) above sea level, is the highest point on the eastern seaboard south of Maine.[159] The summit of the ridge is mostly covered in woodlands as part of the Staten Island Greenbelt.[160]\nNew York City is sometimes referred to collectively as the Five Boroughs.[165] Each borough is coextensive with a respective county of New York State, making New York City one of the U.S. municipalities in multiple counties. There are hundreds of distinct neighborhoods throughout the boroughs, many with a definable history and character.\nIf the boroughs were each independent cities, four of the boroughs (Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, and the Bronx) would be among the ten most populous cities in the United States (Staten Island would be ranked 37th as of 2020); these same boroughs are coterminous with the four most densely populated counties in the United States: New York (Manhattan), Kings (Brooklyn), Bronx, and Queens.\nManhattan (New York County) is the geographically smallest and most densely populated borough. It is home to Central Park and most of the city's skyscrapers, and is sometimes locally known as The City.[166] Manhattan's population density of 72,033 people per square mile (27,812/km2) in 2015 makes it the highest of any county in the United States and higher than the density of any individual American city.[167]\nManhattan is the cultural, administrative, and financial center of New York City and contains the headquarters of many major multinational corporations, the United Nations headquarters, Wall Street, and a number of important universities. The borough of Manhattan is often described as the financial and cultural center of the world.[168][169]\nMost of the borough is situated on Manhattan Island, at the mouth of the Hudson River and the East River, and its southern tip, at the confluence of the two rivers, represents the birthplace of New York City itself. Several small islands also compose part of the borough of Manhattan, including Randalls and Wards Islands, and Roosevelt Island in the East River, and Governors Island and Liberty Island to the south in New York Harbor.\nManhattan Island is loosely divided into the Lower, Midtown, and Uptown regions. Uptown Manhattan is divided by Central Park into the Upper East Side and the Upper West Side, and above the park is Harlem, bordering the Bronx (Bronx County).\nHarlem was predominantly occupied by Jewish and Italian Americans in the 19th century until the Great Migration. It was the center of the Harlem Renaissance.\nThe borough of Manhattan also includes a small neighborhood on the mainland, called Marble Hill, which is contiguous with the Bronx. New York City's remaining four boroughs are collectively referred to as the Outer Boroughs.\nBrooklyn (Kings County), on the western tip of Long Island, is the city's most populous borough. Brooklyn is known for its cultural, social, and ethnic diversity, an independent art scene, distinct neighborhoods, and a distinctive architectural heritage. Downtown Brooklyn is the largest central core neighborhood in the Outer Boroughs. The borough has a long beachfront shoreline including Coney Island, established in the 1870s as one of the earliest amusement grounds in the U.S.[170] Marine Park and Prospect Park are the two largest parks in Brooklyn.[171] Since 2010, Brooklyn has evolved into a thriving hub of entrepreneurship and high technology startup firms,[172][173] and of postmodern art and design.[173][174]\nQueens (Queens County), on Long Island north and east of Brooklyn, is geographically the largest borough, the most ethnically diverse county in the United States,[175] and the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world.[176][177] Historically a collection of small towns and villages founded by the Dutch, the borough has since developed both commercial and residential prominence. Downtown Flushing has become one of the busiest central core neighborhoods in the outer boroughs. Queens is the site of the Citi Field baseball stadium, home of the New York Mets, and hosts the annual U.S. Open tennis tournament at Flushing Meadows\u2013Corona Park. Additionally, two of the three busiest airports serving the New York metropolitan area, John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport, are in Queens. The third is Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey.\nThe Bronx (Bronx County) is both New York City's northernmost borough, and the only one that is mostly on the mainland. It is the location of Yankee Stadium, the baseball park of the New York Yankees, and home to the largest cooperatively-owned housing complex in the United States, Co-op City.[178] It is also home to the Bronx Zoo, the world's largest metropolitan zoo,[179] which spans 265 acres (1.07\u00a0km2) and houses more than 6,000 animals.[180] The Bronx is also the birthplace of hip hop music and its associated culture.[181] Pelham Bay Park is the largest park in New York City, at 2,772 acres (1,122\u00a0ha).[182]\nStaten Island (Richmond County) is the most suburban in character of the five boroughs. Staten Island is connected to Brooklyn by the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, and to Manhattan by way of the free Staten Island Ferry, a daily commuter ferry that provides unobstructed views of the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, and Lower Manhattan. In central Staten Island, the Staten Island Greenbelt spans approximately 2,500 acres (10\u00a0km2), including 28 miles (45\u00a0km) of walking trails and one of the last undisturbed forests in the city.[183] Designated in 1984 to protect the island's natural lands, the Greenbelt comprises seven city parks.\nThe growing skyline of Long Island City in Queens,[184] facing the East River and Manhattan in May 2017\nThe Grand Concourse in The Bronx with Manhattan in the background in February 2018\nSt. George as seen from the Staten Island Ferry, the world's busiest passenger-only ferry system, shuttling passengers between Manhattan and Staten Island\nNew York has architecturally noteworthy buildings in a wide range of styles and from distinct time periods, from the Dutch Colonial Pieter Claesen Wyckoff House in Brooklyn, the oldest section of which dates to 1656, to the modern One World Trade Center, the skyscraper at Ground Zero in Lower Manhattan and the most expensive office tower in the world by construction cost.[185]\nManhattan's skyline, with its many skyscrapers, is universally recognized, and the city has been home to several of the tallest buildings in the world. As of 2019[update], New York City had 6,455 high-rise buildings, the third most in the world after Hong Kong and Seoul.[186] Of these, as of 2011[update], 550 completed structures were at least 330 feet (100\u00a0m) high, with more than fifty completed skyscrapers taller than 656 feet (200\u00a0m). These include the Woolworth Building, an early example of Gothic Revival architecture in skyscraper design, built with massively scaled Gothic detailing; completed in 1913, for 17 years it was the world's tallest building.[187]\nThe 1916 Zoning Resolution required setbacks in new buildings and restricted towers to a percentage of the lot size, to allow sunlight to reach the streets below.[188] The Art Deco style of the Chrysler Building (1930) and Empire State Building (1931), with their tapered tops and steel spires, reflected the zoning requirements. The buildings have distinctive ornamentation, such as the eagles at the corners of the 61st floor on the Chrysler Building, and are considered some of the finest examples of the Art Deco style.[189] A highly influential example of the International Style in the United States is the Seagram Building (1957), distinctive for its fa\u00e7ade using visible bronze-toned I-beams to evoke the building's structure. The Cond\u00e9 Nast Building (2000) is a prominent example of green design in American skyscrapers[190] and has received an award from the American Institute of Architects and AIA New York State for its design.\nThe character of New York's large residential districts is often defined by the elegant brownstone rowhouses and townhouses and shabby tenements that were built during a period of rapid expansion from 1870 to 1930.[191] In contrast, New York City also has neighborhoods that are less densely populated and feature free-standing dwellings. In neighborhoods such as Riverdale (in the Bronx), Ditmas Park (in Brooklyn), and Douglaston (in Queens), large single-family homes are common in various architectural styles such as Tudor Revival and Victorian.[192][193][194]\nStone and brick became the city's building materials of choice after the construction of wood-frame houses was limited in the aftermath of the Great Fire of 1835.[195] A distinctive feature of many of the city's buildings is the roof-mounted wooden water tower. In the 1800s, the city required their installation on buildings higher than six stories to prevent the need for excessively high water pressures at lower elevations, which could break municipal water pipes.[196] Garden apartments became popular during the 1920s in outlying areas, such as Jackson Heights.[197]\nAccording to the United States Geological Survey, an updated analysis of seismic hazard in July 2014 revealed a \"slightly lower hazard for tall buildings\" in New York City than previously assessed. Scientists estimated this lessened risk based upon a lower likelihood than previously thought of slow shaking near the city, which would be more likely to cause damage to taller structures from an earthquake in the vicinity of the city.[198] Manhattan contained over 500 million square feet of office space as of 2022; the COVID-19 pandemic and hybrid work model have prompted consideration of commercial-to-residential conversion within Midtown Manhattan.[199]\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, using the 0\u00a0\u00b0C (32\u00a0\u00b0F) isotherm, New York City features a humid subtropical climate (Cfa), and is thus the northernmost major city on the North American continent with this categorization. The suburbs to the immediate north and west lie in the transitional zone between humid subtropical and humid continental climates (Dfa).[200][201] By the Trewartha classification, the city is defined as having an oceanic climate (Do).[202][203] Annually, the city averages 234 days with at least some sunshine.[204] The city lies in the USDA 7b plant hardiness zone.[205]\nWinters are chilly and damp, and prevailing wind patterns that blow sea breezes offshore temper the moderating effects of the Atlantic Ocean; yet the Atlantic and the partial shielding from colder air by the Appalachian Mountains keep the city warmer in the winter than inland North American cities at similar or lesser latitudes such as Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, and Indianapolis. The daily mean temperature in January, the area's coldest month, is 33.3\u00a0\u00b0F (0.7\u00a0\u00b0C).[206] Temperatures usually drop to 10\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221212\u00a0\u00b0C) several times per winter,[207] yet can also reach 60\u00a0\u00b0F (16\u00a0\u00b0C) for several days even in the coldest winter month. Spring and autumn are unpredictable and can range from cool to warm, although they are usually mild with low humidity. Summers are typically hot and humid, with a daily mean temperature of 77.5\u00a0\u00b0F (25.3\u00a0\u00b0C) in July.[206]\nNighttime temperatures are often enhanced due to the urban heat island effect. Daytime temperatures exceed 90\u00a0\u00b0F (32\u00a0\u00b0C) on average of 17 days each summer and in some years exceed 100\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C), although this is a rare achievement, last occurring on July 18, 2012.[208] Similarly, readings of 0\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221218\u00a0\u00b0C) are also extremely rare, last occurring on February 14, 2016.[209] Extreme temperatures have ranged from \u221215\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221226\u00a0\u00b0C), recorded on February 9, 1934, up to 106\u00a0\u00b0F (41\u00a0\u00b0C) on July 9, 1936;[206] the coldest recorded wind chill was \u221237\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221238\u00a0\u00b0C) on the same day as the all-time record low.[210] The record cold daily maximum was 2\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221217\u00a0\u00b0C) on December 30, 1917, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum was 87\u00a0\u00b0F (31\u00a0\u00b0C), on July 2, 1903.[208] The average water temperature of the nearby Atlantic Ocean ranges from 39.7\u00a0\u00b0F (4.3\u00a0\u00b0C) in February to 74.1\u00a0\u00b0F (23.4\u00a0\u00b0C) in August.[211]\nThe city receives 49.5 inches (1,260\u00a0mm) of precipitation annually, which is relatively evenly spread throughout the year. Average winter snowfall between 1991 and 2020 has been 29.8 inches (76\u00a0cm); this varies considerably between years. Hurricanes and tropical storms are rare in the New York area.[212] Hurricane Sandy brought a destructive storm surge to New York City on the evening of October 29, 2012, flooding numerous streets, tunnels, and subway lines in Lower Manhattan and other areas of the city and cutting off electricity in many parts of the city and its suburbs.[213] The storm and its profound impacts have prompted the discussion of constructing seawalls and other coastal barriers around the shorelines of the city and the metropolitan area to minimize the risk of destructive consequences from another such event in the future.[147][148]\nThe coldest month on record is January 1857, with a mean temperature of 19.6\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22126.9\u00a0\u00b0C) whereas the warmest months on record are July 1825 and July 1999, both with a mean temperature of 81.4\u00a0\u00b0F (27.4\u00a0\u00b0C).[214] The warmest years on record are 2012 and 2020, both with mean temperatures of 57.1\u00a0\u00b0F (13.9\u00a0\u00b0C). The coldest year is 1836, with a mean temperature of 47.3\u00a0\u00b0F (8.5\u00a0\u00b0C).[214][215] The driest month on record is June 1949, with 0.02 inches (0.51\u00a0mm) of rainfall. The wettest month was August 2011, with 18.95 inches (481\u00a0mm) of rainfall. The driest year on record is 1965, with 26.09 inches (663\u00a0mm) of rainfall. The wettest year was 1983, with 80.56 inches (2,046\u00a0mm) of rainfall.[216] The snowiest month on record is February 2010, with 36.9 inches (94\u00a0cm) of snowfall. The snowiest season (Jul\u2013Jun) on record is 1995\u20131996, with 75.6 inches (192\u00a0cm) of snowfall. The least snowy season was 1972\u20131973, with 2.3 inches (5.8\u00a0cm) of snowfall.[217] The earliest seasonal trace of snowfall occurred on October 10, in both 1979 and 1925. The latest seasonal trace of snowfall occurred on May 9, in both 2020 and 1977.[218]\nSee Climate of New York City for additional climate information from the outer boroughs.\nSee or edit raw graph data.\nThe city of New York has a complex park system, with various lands operated by the National Park Service, the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, and the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. In its 2018 ParkScore ranking, the Trust for Public Land reported that the park system in New York City was the ninth-best park system among the fifty most populous U.S. cities.[223] ParkScore ranks urban park systems by a formula that analyzes median park size, park acres as percent of city area, the percent of city residents within a half-mile of a park, spending of park services per resident, and the number of playgrounds per 10,000 residents. In 2021, the New York City Council banned the use of synthetic pesticides by city agencies and instead required organic lawn management. The effort was started by teacher Paula Rogovin's kindergarten class at P.S. 290.[224]\nGateway National Recreation Area contains over 26,000 acres (110\u00a0km2), most of it in New York City.[225] In Brooklyn and Queens, the park contains over 9,000 acres (36\u00a0km2) of salt marsh, wetlands, islands, and water, including most of Jamaica Bay and the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge. Also in Queens, the park includes a significant portion of the western Rockaway Peninsula, most notably Jacob Riis Park and Fort Tilden. In Staten Island, it includes Fort Wadsworth, with historic pre-Civil War era Battery Weed and Fort Tompkins, and Great Kills Park, with beaches, trails, and a marina.\nThe Statue of Liberty National Monument and Ellis Island Immigration Museum are managed by the National Park Service and are in both New York and New Jersey. They are joined in the harbor by Governors Island National Monument. Historic sites under federal management on Manhattan Island include Stonewall National Monument; Castle Clinton National Monument; Federal Hall National Memorial; Theodore Roosevelt Birthplace National Historic Site; General Grant National Memorial (Grant's Tomb); African Burial Ground National Monument; and Hamilton Grange National Memorial. Hundreds of properties are listed on the National Register of Historic Places or as a National Historic Landmark.\nThere are seven state parks within the confines of New York City. Some of them include:\nNew York City has over 28,000 acres (110\u00a0km2) of municipal parkland and 14 miles (23\u00a0km) of public beaches.[228] The largest municipal park in the city is Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx, with 2,772 acres (1,122\u00a0ha).[182][229]\nBrooklyn is home to Fort Hamilton, the U.S. military's only active duty installation within New York City,[240] aside from Coast Guard operations. The facility was established in 1825 on the site of a small battery used during the American Revolution, and it is one of America's longest serving military forts.[241] Today, Fort Hamilton serves as the headquarters of the North Atlantic Division of the United States Army Corps of Engineers and for the New York City Recruiting Battalion. It also houses the 1179th Transportation Brigade, the 722nd Aeromedical Staging Squadron, and a military entrance processing station. Other formerly active military reservations still used for National Guard and military training or reserve operations in the city include Fort Wadsworth in Staten Island and Fort Totten in Queens.\nNew York City is the most populous city in the United States,[254] with 8,804,190 residents[250] incorporating more immigration into the city than outmigration since the 2010 United States census.[255][256] More than twice as many people live in New York City as compared to Los Angeles, the second-most populous U.S. city;[254] and New York has more than three times the population of Chicago, the third-most populous U.S. city. New York City gained more residents between 2010 and 2020 (629,000) than any other U.S. city, and a greater amount than the total sum of the gains over the same decade of the next four largest U.S. cities, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, and Phoenix, Arizona combined.[257][258] New York City's population is about 44% of New York State's population,[259] and about 39% of the population of the New York metropolitan area.[260] The majority of New York City residents in 2020 (5,141,538, or 58.4%) were living on Long Island, in Brooklyn, or in Queens.[261] The New York City metropolitan statistical area, has the largest foreign-born population of any metropolitan region in the world. The New York region continues to be by far the leading metropolitan gateway for legal immigrants admitted into the United States, substantially exceeding the combined totals of Los Angeles and Miami.[262]\nIn 2020, the city had an estimated population density of 29,302.37 inhabitants per square mile (11,313.71/km2), rendering it the nation's most densely populated of all larger municipalities (those with more than 100,000 residents), with several small cities (of fewer than 100,000) in adjacent Hudson County, New Jersey having greater density, as per the 2010 census.[263] Geographically co-extensive with New York County, the borough of Manhattan's 2017 population density of 72,918 inhabitants per square mile (28,154/km2) makes it the highest of any county in the United States and higher than the density of any individual American city.[264][265][266] The next three densest counties in the United States, placing second through fourth, are also New York boroughs: Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Queens respectively.[267]\nThe city's population in 2020 was 30.9% White (non-Hispanic), 28.7% Hispanic or Latino, 20.2% Black or African American (non-Hispanic), 15.6% Asian, and 0.2% Native American (non-Hispanic).[269] A total of 3.4% of the non-Hispanic population identified with more than one race. Throughout its history, New York has been a major port of entry for immigrants into the United States. More than 12 million European immigrants were received at Ellis Island between 1892 and 1924.[270] The term \"melting pot\" was first coined to describe densely populated immigrant neighborhoods on the Lower East Side. By 1900, Germans constituted the largest immigrant group, followed by the Irish, Jews, and Italians.[271] In 1940, Whites represented 92% of the city's population.[253]\nApproximately 37% of the city's population is foreign born, and more than half of all children are born to mothers who are immigrants as of 2013.[272][273] In New York, no single country or region of origin dominates.[272] The ten largest sources of foreign-born individuals in the city as of 2011[update] were the Dominican Republic, China, Mexico, Guyana, Jamaica, Ecuador, Haiti, India, Russia, and Trinidad and Tobago,[274] while the Bangladeshi-born immigrant population has become one of the fastest growing in the city, counting over 74,000 by 2011.[23][275]\nAsian Americans in New York City, according to the 2010 census, number more than one million, greater than the combined totals of San Francisco and Los Angeles.[276] New York contains the highest total Asian population of any U.S. city proper.[277] The New York City borough of Queens is home to the state's largest Asian American population and the largest Andean (Colombian, Ecuadorian, Peruvian, and Bolivian) populations in the United States, and is also the most ethnically  and linguistically diverse urban area in the world.[278][177]\nThe Chinese population constitutes the fastest-growing nationality in New York State. Multiple satellites of the original Manhattan's Chinatown\u2014home to the highest concentration of Chinese people in the Western Hemisphere,[279] as well as in Brooklyn, and around Flushing, Queens, are thriving as traditionally urban enclaves\u2014while also expanding rapidly eastward into suburban Nassau County[280] on Long Island,[281] as the New York metropolitan region and New York State have become the top destinations for new Chinese immigrants, respectively, and large-scale Chinese immigration continues into New York City and surrounding areas,[262][282][283][284][285][286] with the largest metropolitan Chinese diaspora outside Asia,[23][287] including an estimated 812,410 individuals in 2015.[288]\nIn 2012, 6.3% of New York City was of Chinese ethnicity, with nearly three-fourths living in either Queens or Brooklyn, geographically on Long Island.[289] A community numbering 20,000 Korean-Chinese (Chaoxianzu or Joseonjok) is centered in Flushing, Queens, while New York City is also home to the largest Tibetan population outside China, India, and Nepal, also centered in Queens.[290] Koreans made up 1.2% of the city's population, and Japanese 0.3%. Filipinos were the largest Southeast Asian ethnic group at 0.8%, followed by Vietnamese, who made up 0.2% of New York City's population in 2010. Indians are the largest South Asian group, comprising 2.4% of the city's population, with Bangladeshis and Pakistanis at 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively.[291] Queens is the preferred borough of settlement for Asian Indians, Koreans, Filipinos and Malaysians,[292][262] and other Southeast Asians;[293] while Brooklyn is receiving large numbers of both West Indian and Asian Indian immigrants.\nNew York City has the largest European and non-Hispanic white population of any American city. At 2.7\u00a0million in 2012, New York's non-Hispanic White population is larger than the non-Hispanic White populations of Los Angeles (1.1 million), Chicago (865,000), and Houston (550,000) combined.[294] The non-Hispanic White population was 6.6\u00a0million in 1940.[295] The non-Hispanic White population has begun to increase since 2010.[296]\nThe European diaspora residing in the city is very diverse. According to 2012 census estimates, there were roughly 560,000 Italian Americans, 385,000 Irish Americans, 253,000 German Americans, 223,000 Russian Americans, 201,000 Polish Americans, and 137,000 English Americans. Additionally, Greek and French Americans numbered 65,000 each, with those of Hungarian descent estimated at 60,000 people. Ukrainian and Scottish Americans numbered 55,000 and 35,000, respectively. People identifying ancestry from Spain numbered 30,838 total in 2010.[297]\nPeople of Norwegian and Swedish descent both stood at about 20,000 each, while people of Czech, Lithuanian, Portuguese, Scotch-Irish, and Welsh descent all numbered between 12,000 and 14,000.[298] Arab Americans number over 160,000 in New York City,[299] with the highest concentration in Brooklyn. Central Asians, primarily Uzbek Americans, are a rapidly growing segment of the city's non-Hispanic White population, enumerating over 30,000, and including more than half of all Central Asian immigrants to the United States,[300] most settling in Queens or Brooklyn. Albanian Americans are most highly concentrated in the Bronx,[301] while Astoria, Queens is the epicenter of American Greek culture as well as the Cypriot community.\nNew York is also home to the highest Jewish population of any city in the world, numbering 1.6 million in 2022, more than Tel Aviv and Jerusalem combined.[302] In the borough of Brooklyn, an estimated 1 in 4 residents is Jewish.[303] The city's Jewish communities are derived from many diverse sects, predominantly from around the Middle East and Eastern Europe, and including a rapidly growing Orthodox Jewish population, also the largest outside Israel.[290]\nThe metropolitan area is also home to 20% of the nation's Indian Americans and at least 20 Little India enclaves, and 15% of all Korean Americans and four Koreatowns;[248] the largest Asian Indian population in the Western Hemisphere; the largest Russian American,[282] Italian American, and African American populations; the largest Dominican American, Puerto Rican American, and South American[282] and second-largest overall Hispanic population in the United States, numbering 4.8\u00a0million;[297] and includes multiple established Chinatowns within New York City alone.[304]\nEcuador, Colombia, Guyana, Peru, Brazil, and Venezuela are the top source countries from South America for immigrants to the New York City region; the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Haiti, and Trinidad and Tobago in the Caribbean; Nigeria, Egypt, Ghana, Tanzania, Kenya, and South Africa from Africa; and El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala in Central America.[305] Amidst a resurgence of Puerto Rican migration to New York City, this population had increased to approximately 1.3\u00a0million in the metropolitan area as of 2013[update]. In 2022, New York City began receiving thousands of Latino immigrants bused from the state of Texas, mostly originating from Venezuela, Ecuador, Columbia, and Honduras.[306]\nSince 2010, Little Australia has emerged and is growing rapidly, representing the Australasian presence in Nolita, Manhattan.[307][308][309][310] In 2011, there were an estimated 20,000 Australian residents of New York City, nearly quadruple the 5,537 in 2005.[311][312] Qantas Airways of Australia and Air New Zealand have been planning for long-haul flights from New York to Sydney and Auckland, which would both rank among the longest non-stop flights in the world.[313] A Little Sri Lanka has developed in the Tompkinsville neighborhood of Staten Island.[314] Le Petit S\u00e9n\u00e9gal, or Little Senegal, is based in Harlem. Richmond Hill, Queens is often thought of as \"Little Guyana\" for its large Guyanese community,[315] as well as Punjab Avenue (\u0a2a\u0a70\u0a1c\u0a3e\u0a2c \u0a10\u0a35\u0a47\u0a28\u0a3f\u0a0a), or Little Punjab, for its high concentration of Punjabi people. Little Poland is expanding rapidly in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.\nNew York City has been described as the gay capital of the world, and is home to one of the world\u2019s largest LGBTQ populations and the most prominent.[44] The New York metropolitan area is home to about 570,000 self-identifying gay and bisexual people, the largest in the United States.[318][319] Same-sex sexual activity between consenting adults has been legal in New York since the New York v. Onofre case in 1980 which invalidated the state's sodomy law.[320] Same-sex marriages in New York were legalized on June 24, 2011, and were authorized to take place on July 23, 2011.[321] Brian Silverman, the author of Frommer's New York City from $90 a Day, wrote the city has \"one of the world's largest, loudest, and most powerful LGBT communities\", and \"Gay and lesbian culture is as much a part of New York's basic identity as yellow cabs, high-rise buildings, and Broadway theatre\".[322] LGBT travel guide Queer in the World states, \"The fabulosity of Gay New York is unrivaled on Earth, and queer culture seeps into every corner of its five boroughs\".[323] LGBT advocate and entertainer Madonna stated metaphorically, \"Anyways, not only is New York City the best place in the world because of the queer people here. Let me tell you something, if you can make it here, then you must be queer.\"[324]\nThe annual New York City Pride March (or gay pride parade) proceeds southward down Fifth Avenue and ends at Greenwich Village in Lower Manhattan; the parade is the largest pride parade in the world, attracting tens of thousands of participants and millions of sidewalk spectators each June.[325][31] The annual Queens Pride Parade is held in Jackson Heights and is accompanied by the ensuing Multicultural Parade.[326]\nStonewall 50 \u2013 WorldPride NYC 2019 was the largest international Pride celebration in history, produced by Heritage of Pride and enhanced through a partnership with the I \u2764 NY program's LGBT division, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising, with 150,000 participants and five million spectators attending in Manhattan alone.[327] New York City is also home to the largest transgender population in the world, estimated at more than 50,000 in 2018, concentrated in Manhattan and Queens; however, until the June 1969 Stonewall riots, this community had felt marginalized and neglected by the gay community.[326][133] Brooklyn Liberation March, the largest transgender-rights demonstration in LGBTQ history, took place on June 14, 2020, stretching from Grand Army Plaza to Fort Greene, Brooklyn, focused on supporting Black transgender lives, drawing an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 participants.[328][329]\nLargely as a result of Western European missionary work and colonialism, Christianity is the largest religion (59% adherent) in New York City,[330] which is home to the highest number of churches of any city in the world.[14] Roman Catholicism is the largest Christian denomination (33%), followed by Protestantism (23%), and other Christian denominations (3%). The Roman Catholic population are primarily served by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York and Diocese of Brooklyn. Eastern Catholics are divided into numerous jurisdictions throughout the city. Evangelical Protestantism is the largest branch of Protestantism in the city (9%), followed by Mainline Protestantism (8%), while the converse is usually true for other cities and metropolitan areas.[331] In Evangelicalism, Baptists are the largest group; in Mainline Protestantism, Reformed Protestants compose the largest subset. The majority of historically African American churches are affiliated with the National Baptist Convention (USA) and Progressive National Baptist Convention.

A strong correlation was found demonstrating that violent crime rates in New York and other big cities began to fall after lead was removed from American gasoline in the 1970s.[457] Another theory cited to explain New York City's falling homicide rate is the inverse correlation between the number of murders and the increasingly wet climate in the city.[458]\nOrganized crime has long been associated with New York City, beginning with the Forty Thieves and the Roach Guards in the Five Points neighborhood in the 1820s, followed by the Tongs in the same neighborhood, which ultimately evolved into Chinatown, Manhattan.

Attendance in 2013\u20132014 stood at 12.21\u00a0million, representing a 5.5% increase from the 2012\u20132013 season's 11.57\u00a0million.[492] Performance artists displaying diverse skills are ubiquitous on the streets of Manhattan.\nLincoln Center for the Performing Arts, anchoring Lincoln Square on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, is home to numerous influential arts organizations, including the Metropolitan Opera, New York City Opera, New York Philharmonic, and New York City Ballet, as well as the Vivian Beaumont Theater, the Juilliard School, Jazz at Lincoln Center, and Alice Tully Hall. The Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute is in Union Square, and Tisch School of the Arts is based at New York University, while Central Park SummerStage presents free music concerts in Central Park.[493]\nNew York City is home to hundreds of cultural institutions and historic sites. Museum Mile is the name for a section of Fifth Avenue running from 82nd to 105th streets on the Upper East Side of Manhattan,[494] in an area sometimes called Upper Carnegie Hill.[495] Nine museums occupy the length of this section of Fifth Avenue, making it one of the densest displays of culture in the world.[496] Its art museums include the Guggenheim, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Neue Galerie New York, and The Africa Center, which opened in late 2012. In addition to other programming, the museums collaborate for the annual Museum Mile Festival, held each year in June, to promote the museums and increase visitation.[497] Many of the world's most lucrative art auctions are held in New York City.[498][499]\nNew York City's food culture includes an array of international cuisines influenced by the city's immigrant history. Central and Eastern European immigrants, especially Jewish immigrants from those regions, brought bagels, cheesecake, hot dogs, knishes, and delicatessens (delis) to the city. Italian immigrants brought New York-style pizza and Italian cuisine into the city, while Jewish immigrants and Irish immigrants brought pastrami[501] and corned beef,[502] respectively. Chinese and other Asian restaurants, sandwich joints, trattorias, diners, and coffeehouses are ubiquitous throughout the city. Some 4,000 mobile food vendors licensed by the city, many immigrant-owned, have made Middle Eastern foods such as falafel and kebabs[503] examples of modern New York street food. The city is home to \"nearly one thousand of the finest and most diverse haute cuisine restaurants in the world\", according to Michelin.[504] The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene assigns letter grades to the city's restaurants based upon their inspection results.[505] As of 2019, there were 27,043 restaurants in the city, up from 24,865 in 2017.[506] The Queens Night Market in Flushing Meadows\u2013Corona Park attracts more than ten thousand people nightly to sample food from more than 85 countries.[507]\nNew York City is well known for its street parades, which celebrate a broad array of themes, including holidays, nationalities, human rights, and major league sports team championship victories. The majority of parades are held in Manhattan. The primary orientation of the annual street parades is typically from north to south, marching along major avenues. The annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade is the world's largest parade,[508] beginning alongside Central Park and processing southward to the flagship Macy's Herald Square store;[510] the parade is viewed on telecasts worldwide and draws millions of spectators in person.[508] Other notable parades including the annual New York City St. Patrick's Day Parade in March, the LGBT Pride March in June, the Greenwich Village Halloween Parade in October, and numerous parades commemorating the independence days of many nations. Ticker-tape parades celebrating championships won by sports teams as well as other heroic accomplishments march northward along the Canyon of Heroes on Broadway from Bowling Green to City Hall Park in Lower Manhattan.\nThe New York area is home to a distinctive regional accent and speech pattern called the New York dialect, alternatively known as Brooklynese or New Yorkese. It has generally been considered one of the most recognizable accents within American English.[511]\nThe traditional New York area speech pattern is known for its rapid delivery, and its accent is characterized as non-rhotic so that the sound [\u0279] does not appear at the end of a syllable or immediately before a consonant; therefore the pronunciation of the city name as \"New Yawk.\"[512] There is no [\u0279] in words like park [p\u0251\u0259k] or [p\u0252\u0259k] (with vowel backed and diphthongized due to the low-back chain shift), butter [b\u028c\u027e\u0259], or here [hi\u0259]. In another feature called the low back chain shift, the [\u0254] vowel sound of words like talk, law, cross, chocolate, and coffee and the often homophonous [\u0254r] in core and more are tensed and usually raised more than in General American English. In the most old-fashioned and extreme versions of the New York dialect, the vowel sounds of words like \"girl\" and of words like \"oil\" became a diphthong [\u025c\u026a]. This is often misperceived by speakers of other accents as a reversal of the er and oy sounds, so that girl is pronounced \"goil\" and oil is pronounced \"erl\"; this leads to the caricature of New Yorkers saying things like \"Joizey\" (Jersey), \"Toidy-Toid Street\" (33rd St.) and \"terlet\" (toilet).[512] The character Archie Bunker from the 1970s television sitcom All in the Family was an example of this pattern of speech.\nThe classic version of the New York City dialect is generally centered on middle and working-class New Yorkers. The influx of non-European immigrants in recent decades has led to changes in this distinctive dialect,[512] and the traditional form of this speech pattern is no longer as prevalent among general New Yorkers as it has been in the past.[512]\nNew York City is home to the headquarters of the National Football League,[514] Major League Baseball,[515] the National Basketball Association,[516] the National Hockey League,[517] and Major League Soccer.[518] The New York metropolitan area hosts the most sports teams in the first four major North American professional sports leagues with nine, one more than Los Angeles, and has 11 top-level professional sports teams if Major League Soccer is included, also one more than Los Angeles. Participation in professional sports in the city predates all professional leagues.\nThe city has played host to more than 40 major professional teams in the five sports and their respective competing leagues. Four of the ten most expensive stadiums ever built worldwide (MetLife Stadium, the new Yankee Stadium, Madison Square Garden, and Citi Field) are in the New York metropolitan area.[519] Madison Square Garden, its predecessor, the original Yankee Stadium and Ebbets Field, are sporting venues in New York City, the latter two having been commemorated on U.S. postage stamps. New York was the first of eight American cities to have won titles in all four major leagues (MLB, NHL, NFL and NBA), having done so following the Knicks' 1970 title. In 1972, it became the first city to win titles in five sports when the Cosmos won the NASL final.\nNew York has been described as the \"Capital of Baseball\".[520] There have been 35 Major League Baseball World Series and 73 pennants won by New York teams. It is one of only five metro areas (Los Angeles, Chicago, Baltimore\u2013Washington, and the San Francisco Bay Area being the others) to have two baseball teams. Additionally, there have been 14 World Series in which two New York City teams played each other, known as a Subway Series and occurring most recently in 2000. No other metropolitan area has had this happen more than once (Chicago in 1906, St. Louis in 1944, and the San Francisco Bay Area in 1989).\nThe city's two Major League Baseball teams are the New York Mets, who play at Citi Field in Queens,[521] and the New York Yankees, who play at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx. These teams compete in six games of interleague play every regular season that has also come to be called the Subway Series. The Yankees have won a record 27 championships,[522] while the Mets have won the World Series twice.[523] The city also was once home to the Brooklyn Dodgers (now the Los Angeles Dodgers), who won the World Series once,[524] and the New York Giants (now the San Francisco Giants), who won the World Series five times. Both teams moved to California in 1958.[525] There is also one Minor League Baseball team in the city, the Mets-affiliated Brooklyn Cyclones,[526] and the city gained a club in the independent Atlantic League when the Staten Island FerryHawks began play in 2022.[527]\nThe city is represented in the National Football League by the New York Giants and the New York Jets, although both teams play their home games at MetLife Stadium in nearby East Rutherford, New Jersey,[528] which hosted Super Bowl XLVIII in 2014.[529]\nThe metropolitan area is home to three National Hockey League teams. The New York Rangers, the traditional representative of the city itself and one of the league's Original Six, play at Madison Square Garden in Manhattan. The New York Islanders, traditionally representing Nassau and Suffolk Counties of Long Island, play in UBS Arena in Elmont, New York, and played in Brooklyn's Barclays Center from 2015 to 2020. The New Jersey Devils play at Prudential Center in nearby Newark, New Jersey and traditionally represent the counties of neighboring New Jersey which are coextensive with the boundaries of the New York metropolitan area and media market.\nThe city's National Basketball Association teams are the Brooklyn Nets (previously known as the New York Nets and New Jersey Nets as they moved around the metropolitan area) and the New York Knicks, while the New York Liberty is the city's Women's National Basketball Association team. The first national college-level basketball championship, the National Invitation Tournament, was held in New York in 1938 and remains in the city.[530] The city is well known for its links to basketball, which is played in nearly every park in the city by local youth, many of whom have gone on to play for major college programs and in the NBA.\nIn soccer, New York City is represented by New York City FC of Major League Soccer, who play their home games at Yankee Stadium[531] and the New York Red Bulls, who play their home games at Red Bull Arena in nearby Harrison, New Jersey.[532] NJ/NY Gotham FC also plays their home games in Red Bull Arena, representing the metropolitan area in the National Women's Soccer League. Historically, the city is known for the New York Cosmos, the highly successful former professional soccer team which was the American home of Pel\u00e9. A new version of the New York Cosmos was formed in 2010, and most recently played in the third-division National Independent Soccer Association before going on hiatus in January 2021. New York was a host city for the 1994 FIFA World Cup[533] and will be one of eleven US host cities for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.[534]\nThe annual United States Open Tennis Championships is one of the world's four Grand Slam tennis tournaments and is held at the National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows\u2013Corona Park, Queens.[535] The New York City Marathon, which courses through all five boroughs, is the world's largest running marathon,[513] with 51,394 finishers in 2016[536] and 98,247 applicants for the 2017 race.[513] The Millrose Games is an annual track and field meet whose featured event is the Wanamaker Mile. Boxing is also a prominent part of the city's sporting scene, with events like the Amateur Boxing Golden Gloves being held at Madison Square Garden each year.[537] The city is also considered the host of the Belmont Stakes, the last, longest and oldest of horse racing's Triple Crown races, held just over the city's border at Belmont Park on the first or second Sunday of June. The city also hosted the 1932 U.S. Open golf tournament and the 1930 and 1939 PGA Championships, and has been host city for both events several times, most notably for nearby Winged Foot Golf Club. The Gaelic games are played in Riverdale, Bronx at Gaelic Park, home to the New York GAA, the only North American team to compete at the senior inter-county level.\nIn terms of hosting multi-sport events, New York City hosted the 1984 Summer Paralympics and the 1998 Goodwill Games. New York City's bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics was one of five finalists, but lost out to London.[538]\nEnvironmental issues in New York City are affected by the city's size, density, abundant public transportation infrastructure, and its location at the mouth of the Hudson River. For example, it is one of the country's biggest sources of pollution and has the lowest per-capita greenhouse gas emissions rate and electricity usage. Governors Island is planned to host a US$1\u00a0billion research and education center to make New York City the global leader in addressing the climate crisis.[540]\nNew York City has focused on reducing its environmental impact and carbon footprint.[541] Mass transit use in New York City is the highest in the United States. Also, by 2010, the city had 3,715 hybrid taxis and other clean diesel vehicles, representing around 28% of New York's taxi fleet in service, the most of any city in North America.[542] New York City is the host of Climate Week NYC, the largest Climate Week to take place globally and regarded as major annual climate summit.\nNew York's high rate of public transit use, more than 200,000 daily cyclists as of 2014[update],[543] and many pedestrian commuters make it the most energy-efficient major city in the United States.[544] Walk and bicycle modes of travel account for 21% of all modes for trips in the city; nationally the rate for metro regions is about 8%.[545] In both its 2011 and 2015 rankings, Walk Score named New York City the most walkable large city in the United States,[546][547][548] and in 2018, Stacker ranked New York the most walkable U.S. city.[549] Citibank sponsored the introduction of 10,000 public bicycles for the city's bike-share project in the summer of 2013.[550] New York City's numerical \"in-season cycling indicator\" of bicycling in the city had hit an all-time high of 437 when measured in 2014.[551]\nThe city government was a petitioner in the landmark Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency Supreme Court case forcing the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases as pollutants. The city is a leader in the construction of energy-efficient green office buildings, including the Hearst Tower among others.[190] Mayor Bill de Blasio has committed to an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions between 2014 and 2050 to reduce the city's contributions to climate change, beginning with a comprehensive \"Green Buildings\" plan.[541]\nThe New York City drinking water supply is extracted from the protected Catskill Mountains watershed.[552] As a result of the watershed's integrity and undisturbed natural water filtration system, New York is one of only four major cities in the United States the majority of whose drinking water is pure enough not to require purification through water treatment plants.[553] The city's municipal water system is the largest in the United States, moving over one billion gallons of water per day;[554] a leak in the Delaware aqueduct results in some 20 million gallons a day being lost under the Hudson River.[555] The Croton Watershed north of the city is undergoing construction of a $3.2\u00a0billion water purification plant to augment New York City's water supply by an estimated 290\u00a0million gallons daily, representing a greater than 20% addition to the city's current availability of water.[556] The ongoing expansion of New York City Water Tunnel No. 3, an integral part of the New York City water supply system, is the largest capital construction project in the city's history,[557] with segments serving Manhattan and the Bronx completed, and with segments serving Brooklyn and Queens planned for construction in 2020.[558] In 2018, New York City announced a $1\u00a0billion investment to protect the integrity of its water system and to maintain the purity of its unfiltered water supply.[554]\nAccording to the 2016 World Health Organization Global Urban Ambient Air Pollution Database,[559] the annual average concentration in New York City's air of particulate matter measuring 2.5\u00a0micrometers or less (PM2.5) was 7.0\u00a0micrograms per cubic meter, or 3.0\u00a0micrograms within the recommended limit of the WHO Air Quality Guidelines for the annual mean PM2.5.[560] The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, in partnership with Queens College, conducts the New York Community Air Survey to measure pollutants at about 150 locations.[561]\nNewtown Creek, a 3.5-mile (6-kilometer) a long estuary that forms part of the border between the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, has been designated a Superfund site for environmental clean-up and remediation of the waterway's recreational and economic resources for many communities.[562] One of the most heavily used bodies of water in the Port of New York and New Jersey, it had been one of the most contaminated industrial sites in the country,[563] containing years of discarded toxins, an estimated 30\u00a0million US gallons (110,000\u00a0m3) of spilled oil, including the Greenpoint oil spill, raw sewage from New York City's sewer system,[563] and other accumulation.\nNew York City has been a metropolitan municipality with a Strong mayor\u2013council form of government[564] since its consolidation in 1898. In New York City, the city government is responsible for public education, correctional institutions, public safety, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply, and welfare services.\nThe mayor and council members are elected to four-year terms. The City Council is a unicameral body consisting of 51 council members whose districts are defined by geographic population boundaries.[565] Each term for the mayor and council members lasts four years and has a two consecutive-term limit,[566] which is reset after a four-year break. The New York City Administrative Code, the New York City Rules, and the City Record are the code of local laws, compilation of regulations, and official journal, respectively.[567][568]\nEach borough is coextensive with a judicial district of the state Unified Court System, of which the Criminal Court and the Civil Court are the local courts, while the New York Supreme Court conducts major trials and appeals. Manhattan hosts the First Department of the Supreme Court, Appellate Division while Brooklyn hosts the Second Department. There are also several extrajudicial administrative courts, which are executive agencies and not part of the state Unified Court System.\nUniquely among major American cities, New York is divided between, and is host to the main branches of, two different U.S. district courts: the District Court for the Southern District of New York, whose main courthouse is on Foley Square near City Hall in Manhattan and whose jurisdiction includes Manhattan and the Bronx; and the District Court for the Eastern District of New York, whose main courthouse is in Brooklyn and whose jurisdiction includes Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and U.S. Court of International Trade are also based in New York, also on Foley Square in Manhattan.\nThe present mayor is Eric Adams. He was elected in 2021 with 67% of the vote, and assumed office on January 1, 2022.\nThe Democratic Party holds the majority of public offices. As of April 2016, 69% of registered voters in the city are Democrats and 10% are Republicans.[569] New York City has not been carried by a Republican  presidential election since President Calvin Coolidge won the five boroughs in 1924. A Republican candidate for statewide office has not won all five boroughs of the city since it was incorporated in 1898. In 2012, Democrat Barack Obama became the first presidential candidate of any party to receive more than 80% of the overall vote in New York City, sweeping all five boroughs. Party platforms center on affordable housing, education, and economic development, and labor politics are of importance in the city. Thirteen out of 27 U.S. congressional districts in the state of New York include portions of New York City.[570]\nNew York is one of the most important sources of political fundraising in the United States. At least four of the top five ZIP Codes in the nation for political contributions were in Manhattan for the 2004, 2006, and 2008 elections. The top ZIP Code, 10021 on the Upper East Side, generated the most money for the 2004 presidential campaigns of George W. Bush and John Kerry.[571] The city has a strong imbalance of payments with the national and state governments. It receives 83 cents in services for every $1 it sends to the federal government in taxes (or annually sends $11.4\u00a0billion more than it receives back). City residents and businesses also sent an additional $4.1\u00a0billion in the 2009\u20132010 fiscal year to the state of New York than the city received in return.[572]\nNew York City's comprehensive transportation system is both complex and extensive.\nMass transit in New York City, most of which runs 24 hours a day, accounts for one in every three users of mass transit in the United States, and two-thirds of the nation's rail riders live in the New York City metropolitan area.[573][574]\nThe New York City Subway system is the largest rapid transit system in the world when measured by stations in operation, with 472, and by length of routes. Nearly all of New York's subway system is open 24 hours a day, in contrast to the overnight shutdown common to systems in most cities, including Hong Kong,[575][576] London, Paris, Seoul,[577][578] and Tokyo. The New York City Subway is also the busiest metropolitan rail transit system in the Western Hemisphere, with 1.76\u00a0billion passenger rides in 2015,[579] while Grand Central Terminal, also referred to as \"Grand Central Station\", is the world's largest railway station by number of train platforms.\nPublic transport is widely used in New York City. 54.6% of New Yorkers commuted to work in 2005 using mass transit.[580] This is in contrast to the rest of the United States, where 91% of commuters travel in automobiles to their workplace.[581] According to the New York City Comptroller, workers in the New York City area spend an average of 6\u00a0hours and 18 minutes getting to work each week, the longest commute time in the nation among large cities.[582] New York is the only U.S. city in which a majority (52%) of households do not have a car; only 22% of Manhattanites own a car.[583] Due to their high usage of mass transit, New Yorkers spend less of their household income on transportation than the national average, saving $19\u00a0billion annually on transportation compared to other urban Americans.[584]\nNew York City's commuter rail network is the largest in North America.[573] The rail network, connecting New York City to its suburbs, consists of the Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North Railroad, and New Jersey Transit. The combined systems converge at Grand Central Terminal and Pennsylvania Station and contain more than 250 stations and 20 rail lines.[573] In Queens, the elevated AirTrain people mover system connects 24 hours a day JFK International Airport to the New York City Subway and the Long Island Rail Road; a separate AirTrain system is planned alongside the Grand Central Parkway to connect LaGuardia Airport to these transit systems.[585][586] For inter-city rail, New York City is served by Amtrak, whose busiest station by a significant margin is Pennsylvania Station on the West Side of Manhattan, from which Amtrak provides connections to Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. along the Northeast Corridor, and long-distance train service to other North American cities.[587]\nThe Staten Island Railway rapid transit system solely serves Staten Island, operating 24 hours a day. The Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH train) links Midtown and Lower Manhattan to northeastern New Jersey, primarily Hoboken, Jersey City, and Newark. Like the New York City Subway, the PATH operates 24 hours a day; meaning three of the six rapid transit systems in the world which operate on 24-hour schedules are wholly or partly in New York (the others are a portion of the Chicago\u00a0\"L\", the PATCO Speedline serving Philadelphia, and the Copenhagen Metro).\nMultibillion-dollar heavy rail transit projects under construction in New York City include the Second Avenue Subway, and the East Side Access project.[588]\nNew York City's public bus fleet runs 24/7 and is the largest in North America.[590] The Port Authority Bus Terminal, the main intercity bus terminal of the city, serves 7,000 buses and 200,000 commuters daily, making it the busiest bus station in the world.[589]\nNew York's airspace is the busiest in the United States and one of the world's busiest air transportation corridors. The three busiest airports in the New York metropolitan area include John F. Kennedy International Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport, and LaGuardia Airport; 130.5\u00a0million travelers used these three airports in 2016.[591] JFK and Newark Liberty were the busiest and fourth busiest U.S. gateways for international air passengers, respectively, in 2012; as of 2011[update], JFK was the busiest airport for international passengers in North America.[592]\nPlans have advanced to expand passenger volume at a fourth airport, Stewart International Airport near Newburgh, New York, by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.[593] Plans were announced in July 2015 to entirely rebuild LaGuardia Airport in a multibillion-dollar project to replace its aging facilities.[594] Other commercial airports in or serving the New York metropolitan area include Long Island MacArthur Airport, Trenton\u2013Mercer Airport and Westchester County Airport. The primary general aviation airport serving the area is Teterboro Airport.\nThe Staten Island Ferry is the world's busiest ferry route, carrying more than 23\u00a0million passengers from July 2015 through June 2016 on the 5.2-mile (8.4\u00a0km) route between Staten Island and Lower Manhattan and running 24 hours a day.[595] Other ferry systems shuttle commuters between Manhattan and other locales within the city and the metropolitan area.\nNYC Ferry, a NYCEDC initiative with routes planned to travel to all five boroughs, was launched in 2017, with second graders choosing the names of the ferries.[596] Meanwhile, Seastreak ferry announced construction of a 600-passenger high-speed luxury ferry in September 2016, to shuttle riders between the Jersey Shore and Manhattan, anticipated to start service in 2017; this would be the largest vessel in its class.[597]\nOther features of the city's transportation infrastructure encompass 13,587 yellow taxicabs;[598] other vehicle for hire companies;[599][600] and the Roosevelt Island Tramway, an aerial tramway that transports commuters between Roosevelt Island and Manhattan Island.\nDespite New York's heavy reliance on its vast public transit system, streets are a defining feature of the city. The Commissioners' Plan of 1811 greatly influenced the city's physical development. Several of the city's streets and avenues, including Broadway,[601] Wall Street,[602] Madison Avenue,[360] and Seventh Avenue are also used as metonyms for national industries there: the theater, finance, advertising, and fashion organizations, respectively.\nNew York City also has an extensive web of freeways and parkways, which link the city's boroughs to each other and to North Jersey, Westchester County, Long Island, and southwestern Connecticut through various bridges and tunnels. Because these highways serve millions of outer borough and suburban residents who commute into Manhattan, it is quite common for motorists to be stranded for hours in traffic congestion that are a daily occurrence, particularly during rush hour.[603][604] Congestion pricing in New York City will go into effect in 2022 at the earliest.[605][606][607]\nNew York City is also known for its rules regarding turning at red lights. Unlike the rest of the United States, New York State prohibits right or left turns on red in cities with a population greater than one million, to reduce traffic collisions and increase pedestrian safety. In New York City, therefore, all turns at red lights are illegal unless a sign permitting such maneuvers is present.[608]\nNew York City is located on one of the world's largest natural harbors,[611] and the boroughs of Manhattan and Staten Island are primarily coterminous with islands of the same names, while Queens and Brooklyn are at the west end of the larger Long Island, and the Bronx is on New York State's mainland. This situation of boroughs separated by water led to the development of an extensive infrastructure of bridges and tunnels.\nThe George Washington Bridge is the world's busiest motor vehicle bridge,[609][610] connecting Manhattan to Bergen County, New Jersey. The Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge is the longest suspension bridge in the Americas and one of the world's longest.[612][613] The Brooklyn Bridge is an icon of the city itself. The towers of the Brooklyn Bridge are built of limestone, granite, and Rosendale cement, and their architectural style is neo-Gothic, with characteristic pointed arches above the passageways through the stone towers. This bridge was also the longest suspension bridge in the world from its opening until 1903, and is the first steel-wire suspension bridge. The Queensboro Bridge is an important piece of cantilever architecture. The Manhattan Bridge, opened in 1909, is considered to be the forerunner of modern suspension bridges, and its design served as the model for many of the long-span suspension bridges around the world; the Manhattan Bridge, Throgs Neck Bridge, Triborough Bridge, and Verrazano-Narrows Bridge are all examples of structural expressionism.[614][615]\nManhattan Island is linked to New York City's outer boroughs and to New Jersey. The Lincoln Tunnel, which carries 120,000 vehicles a day under the Hudson River between New Jersey and Midtown Manhattan, is the busiest vehicular tunnel in the world.[616] The tunnel was built instead of a bridge to allow unfettered passage of large passenger and cargo ships that sailed through New York Harbor and up the Hudson River to Manhattan's piers. The Holland Tunnel, connecting Lower Manhattan to Jersey City, New Jersey, was the world's first mechanically ventilated vehicular tunnel when it opened in 1927.[617][618] The Queens\u2013Midtown Tunnel, built to relieve congestion on the bridges connecting Manhattan with Queens and Brooklyn, was the largest non-federal project in its time when it was completed in 1940.[619] President Franklin\u00a0D. Roosevelt was the first person to drive through it.[620] The Brooklyn\u2013Battery Tunnel (officially known as the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel) runs underneath Battery Park and connects the Financial District at the southern tip of Manhattan to Red Hook in Brooklyn.\nCycling in New York City is associated with mixed cycling conditions that include urban density, relatively flat terrain, congested roadways with stop-and-go traffic, and many pedestrians. The city's large cycling population includes utility cyclists, such as delivery and messenger services; cycling clubs for recreational cyclists; and an increasing number of commuters.[621] Cycling is increasingly popular in New York City; in 2017 there were approximately 450,000 daily bike trips, compared with 170,000 daily bike trips in 2005.[622] As of 2017[update], New York City had 1,333 miles (2,145\u00a0km) of bike lanes, compared to 513 miles (826\u00a0km) of bike lanes in 2006.[622] As of 2019, there are 126 miles (203\u00a0km) of segregated or \"protected\" bike lanes citywide.[623]\nIn 2006, the Sister City Program of the City of New York, Inc.[624] was restructured and renamed New York City Global Partners. Through this program, New York City has expanded its international outreach to a network of cities worldwide, promoting the exchange of ideas and innovation between their citizenry and policymakers.

Wikipedia": {"text": "Pier A (also known as City Pier A) is a pier in the Hudson River at Battery Park in Lower Manhattan, New York City. It was built from 1884 to 1886 as the headquarters of the New York City Board of Dock Commissioners and the New York City Police Department (NYPD)'s Harbor Department. Pier A is the only remaining masonry pier in New York City. Above the pier is a two- and three-story building designed by George Sears Greene Jr., with a clock tower facing the Hudson River. The pier is a New York City designated landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).\nThe building atop Pier A is generally two to three stories tall, except for a four-story clock tower at the southwestern corner of the building. The original structure is two stories tall and extends west into the Hudson River. The eastern, or inshore, end of Pier A was constructed in 1900 and expanded to three stories in 1904. The pier itself is composed of a concrete deck supported by girders. The building originally contained offices for the NYPD and Docks Department, which were subsequently converted into restaurant spaces.\nThe Department of Docks started constructing the pier in July 1884; although the pier deck was completed in 1885, the building was not finished until early 1886. The NYPD occupied Pier A until 1955, while the Department of Docks relocated to the Battery Maritime Building in 1959. The New York City Fire Department (FDNY) used the pier from 1960 to 1992 as a fireboat station. Following a failed attempt to demolish Pier A as part of the development of Battery Park City in the 1970s, the structure was added to the NRHP and became a city landmark. Mayor Ed Koch selected Wings Point Associates to redevelop Pier A in 1988, but the redevelopment was stalled for the next two decades. Pier A was temporarily used as a commuter ferry landing after the September 11 attacks. After the Battery Park City Authority leased Pier A in 2008, it was renovated into a restaurant called Harbor House, which operated from 2014 to 2020.\nPier A is on the Hudson River, in the Battery Park City neighborhood[4] of Lower Manhattan in New York City, near the southern end of Manhattan Island. The pier is on the North River, the southernmost portion of the Hudson River, which drains into New York Harbor immediately to the south. It abuts the northern end of Battery Park, just south of the intersection of West Street and Battery Place.[5] Pier A measures 45\u00a0ft (14\u00a0m) wide by 285\u00a0ft (87\u00a0m) long.[5][6] It extends into the river at a 116.5-degree angle[a] from the bulkhead along Battery Park's shoreline.[5]\nThe pier is part of the eponymous Pier A Plaza, which opened to the public in November 2014.[7] Pier A Plaza includes pedestrian space and a bike path.[8][9] It is part of the Manhattan Waterfront Greenway[10] and connects with Robert F. Wagner Jr. Park to the north.[11][12] In 1991, the American Merchant Mariners' Memorial was installed on a rebuilt stone breakwater just south of Pier A, connected to it by a dock. Designed by the sculptor Marisol Escobar, the memorial depicts four merchant seamen with their sinking vessel after it had been attacked by a U-boat during World War II. One of the seamen is in the water and is covered by the sea with each high tide.[13][14]\nThe building atop Pier A is generally two to three stories tall, except for a four-story clock tower at the southwestern corner of the building.[5] The structure is 322\u00a0ft (98\u00a0m) long, extending onto the Manhattan shoreline to the east.[6] The engineer in charge of construction and design was George Sears Greene Jr., the engineer-in-chief of the New York City Board of Docks from 1875 to 1898[15] and the son of the civil engineer George S. Greene.[16][17] Pier A's current design dates to 1919, when the clock was added.[18] It is sometimes nicknamed the \"Liberty Gateway\" despite never having been a major disembarkation point.[16]\nThe eastern or inshore end of Pier A was constructed in 1900 as a square two-story annex, which was expanded to three stories in 1904.[19][20] It extends about 50\u00a0ft (15\u00a0m) inland.[6][20] The inshore annex's facade is divided vertically into three bays each on its northern, eastern, and southern elevations.[19] The bays are divided by one-story pilasters, and a cornice runs above the third story.[20] The eastern elevation contains a large archway on the ground floor (originally used by horse-drawn carriages), which is flanked by smaller openings with architraves. On the second and third stories of the eastern elevation, there is a triple window in the center bay and a single window on either side.[19] Above the third story, the center bay contains a triangular pediment with seashell decorations, originally decorated with the letter \"A\".[6][19][20] On the northern and southern elevations, the inshore annex contains a double window in each bay, as well as a segmentally arched pediment at the center above the third story. The inshore annex is topped by a gable roof.[20]\nJust west of Pier A's inshore annex is another three-story section with a flat roof.[19] The central portion of the building is two stories high and extends into the Hudson River. Unlike the inshore annex, the facade of the central section is plain,[19][21] although it originally contained cornices, pilasters, and decorative trim.[6] This section contains an arcade of segmental arches on the first story, as well as single, double, and projecting three-sided windows on the second story.[19][21] The central section is topped by a hip roof,[21] with several monitors protruding from the roof, as well as a gable at the western end.[19] The Battery Park City Authority (BPCA) replaced the copper roof during the early 21st century.[22]\nThere is a square clock tower at the southwestern corner of Pier A, measuring 70\u00a0ft (21\u00a0m) tall with a pyramidal roof at its peak.[21] The first and second stories have plain wall surfaces. The third story contains arched windows on all four sides, which originally illuminated an observation room, while the fourth story contains four clock faces, one on each side.[19] The observation room was used to monitor maritime traffic in New York Harbor and was removed when the clock was installed in 1919.[6] The clock was taken from a ship and was donated by Daniel G. Reid, founder of United States Steel Corporation.[23][24][25] According to a Department of Marine and Aviation spokesperson quoted in The New York Times, it was the first memorial in the United States dedicated to those who died in World War I.[26] Unlike other civil bells, but similarly to simple ship bells, there are eight bells, one for each half-hour of a four-hour watch. At half-hour intervals, the bell is struck between one time (at 12:30, 4:30, and 8:30) and eight times (at 12:00, 4:00, and 8:00).[27]\nPier A was built with a masonry foundation, unlike similar piers of the time, which were typically built on wooden piles. An earlier masonry pier, East River Pier 1, had been built nearby at Whitehall Street in 1875; the New York City government largely stopped constructing masonry piers after captains complained that the piers caused damage to their ships. Pier A, which was not intended to accommodate large ships, was one of the few masonry piers built after East River Pier 1 was completed.[6] The pier building was constructed with a superstructure of brick, iron, and terracotta.[28] The eastern end of the building was intended to store the Department of Docks' records and was fireproof.[23][28] Unusual for buildings of the late 19th century, Pier A had its own central heating system, gas lights, and water supply system. The building was covered with several layers of insulation.[18]\nThe underlying layer of bedrock was as shallow as 10\u00a0ft (3.0\u00a0m) below mean low water, above which was a layer of soft mud, thus preventing the installation of iron or wooden pilings. As such, the mud above the bedrock was removed when the dock was built, and a timber \"crib\" was sunken into the water at the site of the dock.[5][18] This \"crib\", measuring 15 by 50\u00a0ft (4.6 by 15.2\u00a0m) across and 5\u00a0ft (1.5\u00a0m) high; sand and trap rock were used as ballast to sink the crib into the water.[18] Divers then filled the timber crib with concrete bags. Another layer of concrete was poured above these bags and then leveled off, providing a foundation for the rectangular concrete blocks that were placed above these bags. Eight granite sub-piers were then laid above the rectangular concrete blocks to a height of 2\u00a0ft (0.61\u00a0m) above mean high water.[5] The sub-piers support the deck of the maritime pier, which consist of concrete arches and iron girders.[5][18] The surface of the deck was covered with a 2\u00a0in (5.1\u00a0cm) layer of asphalt.[5]\nOriginally, most of the ground floor was a unified space, except for the westernmost 38\u00a0ft (12\u00a0m) and the easternmost 48\u00a0ft (15\u00a0m) of the ground story, where a central hallway divided each end into multiple rooms.[29] The New York City Police Department (NYPD) was housed on the northern side of the ground floor, while the New York City Department of Docks was on the southern side.[18][29] The second story contained a 200\u00a0ft-long (61\u00a0m) hallway flanked by the Dock Department's offices. The NYPD used a 70 by 70\u00a0ft (21 by 21\u00a0m) watch tower on the southwestern corner of the second floor, and the Department of Docks had a 41 by 36.5\u00a0ft (12.5 by 11.1\u00a0m) record room at the eastern end.[23]\nThe interior of the building contains an Art Deco-style room that was used as the Docks Commissioner's office.[6] This room is an octagonal space on the second floor with teakwood paneling, and it remained largely intact in the 2010s.[27] When the building was converted into a restaurant in 2014, the first story was remodeled after a German beer hall;[27][30] there were outdoor dining areas on either side of this beer hall.[31] The second floor became a multi-room restaurant space with a cocktail bar.[31][32] The restaurant space included a bar measuring 128\u00a0ft (39\u00a0m) long, as well as a stained-glass chandelier with the letter \"A\".[22] The third floor became an event space.[30][31][32]\nThe New York State Legislature revised the New York City Charter in 1870 to create the New York City Board of Dock Commissioners.[33][3] The following year, the department published a plan for the development of piers on the city's waterfront, which the state legislature approved. Any subsequent piers had to be approved separately, including Pier A, which was not part of the 1871 plan. The Docks Department initially faced resistance from businesses on the waterfront, which previously had been subjected to little or no city regulation.[3]\nThe New York State Legislature amended the Docks Department's plan in 1884, requiring the Docks Department to develop a pier for the NYPD's Harbor Department.[18] The commissioners selected a site at Battery Park, on the southern tip of Manhattan Island, due to its central location at the northern end of New York Harbor.[34] The commissioners directed the Department of Docks to construct a new pier with offices for the Harbor Department, as well as for the Department of Docks' own headquarters. on July 3, 1884.[18][34] By relocating its offices, the Department of Docks wished to save $6,500 annually in rent.[28][35] Construction started immediately under the supervision of George S. Greene Jr..[18][34] Five of the eight sub-piers were finished by May 1885,[34] and the Department of Docks reported that July that it had completed the deck for $80,000.[35] Work on the building atop Pier A commenced in September 1885.[18] The building cost $40,000 to construct, bringing the project's total cost to $120,000.[28]\nThe Department of Docks moved into the building on March 20, 1886,[28] and the Harbor Police also moved into the structure.[2][36] The year after Pier A's opening, the Chicago Daily Tribune reported that maritime crimes in New York Harbor had decreased drastically.[36] The Docks Department also used Pier A as an auction house, selling leases for New York City's piers.[37] The CS Mackay-Bennett laid a telegraph cable between Pier A and Coney Island in 1894.[38][39] Subsequently, the Commercial Cable Company transferred the receiving station for its transatlantic telegraph cable from Coney Island to Pier A, as the receiving station at Coney Island had experienced excessive electrical interference from streetcars.[40] In 1899, the NYPD reestablished[b] its Steamboat Squad, which patrolled the waters around lower Manhattan and was headquartered at Pier A. To make way for the Steamboat Squad, the Harbor Department relocated its offices to the western end of the building.[41]\nThe Department of Docks' engineer-in-chief introduced plans in February 1900 to extend Pier A about 50\u00a0ft (15\u00a0m) eastward.[42][43] The first two stories of the eastward annex were constructed at this time, and a third story was built above the eastern annex in 1904.[20] To reduce navigational hazards in the North River, federal government removed a large ledge of rock next to Pier A in 1905;[44][45] the project took over a year to complete.[46] Pier A was also the homeport of the Harbor Department patrol boat Patrol, which traveled around New York Harbor nightly until she was retired in 1916.[47] During World War I, the Harbor Department officers at Pier A were also trained to guard against enemy attacks.[48] After the end of World War I, a clock was installed in the pier's tower as a memorial to 116,000 US servicemen who died during World War I.[16] The clock was unveiled on January 25, 1919, with speeches made by mayor John Francis Hylan and docks commissioner George Murray Hulbert.[24][25]\nIn 1922, the NYPD abolished the Marine Division and replaced it with the 16th Inspection District, which was headquartered at Pier A.[49] Two years later, the NYPD acquired the speedboat Battery, which was based out of Pier A.[50] Numerous notable figures sailed to New York City through Pier A during the mid-20th century, including former British prime minister David Lloyd George;[51] aviator Charles Lindbergh;[52] Crown Prince Olav and Princess Martha of Norway;[53] and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth I of England.[54] The pier also hosted events, such as a showcase of products from Florida,[55] as well as an exhibition of a U-boat captured during World War II.[56] Docks Department employees dedicated a bronze tablet at Pier A, honoring former docks commissioner Michael Cosgrove, in 1930.[57]\nThe Department of Docks requested funding from the New York City Council in 1938 to erect a new administration building on Pier A.[58] By 1941, docks commissioner John McKenzie had prepared plans for a new building on the site.[59] The project was part of New York City park commissioner Robert Moses's plan to rebuild Battery Park, which he presented to the New York City Board of Estimate in March 1942.[60][61] The Pier A building would be replaced with a larger facility that housed the Department of Docks, the NYPD, and a nearby FDNY station.[61] The City Council allocated funding for the planned new building but delayed its construction until after World War II.[62] The Department of Docks subsequently became the Department of Marine and Aviation.[27] Pier A was not rebuilt after World War II, even as the Department of Marine and Aviation spent $26 million renovating other piers in the city.[63] Instead, by 1952, the Department of Marine and Aviation was planning to relocate to the Battery Maritime Building on the East River, allowing the FDNY and NYPD to consolidate their space at Pier A.[64][65]\nThe Department of Marine and Aviation built a 50 by 50\u00a0ft (15 by 15\u00a0m) heliport at Pier A, which opened on June 11, 1953, as the second heliport operated by the city government.[66][67] Initially, the heliport was primarily used by the NYPD.[67] In late 1955, the NYPD's Harbor Precinct relocated to Randalls Island.[68][69] The Department of Marine and Aviation requested $600,000 in 1958 to convert North River piers\u00a0A and\u00a01 into cargo piers.[70] Eleven hundred employees of the Department of Marine and Aviation relocated from Pier A to the Battery Maritime Building in February 1959. By that time, Pier A only housed the department's executive and administrative staff, while other Marine and Aviation offices were housed in various buildings nearby.[71][72] The city government planned to turn Pier A over to the FDNY and NYPD.[72]\nThe FDNY used the pier from 1960 to 1992 as a fireboat station.[73] Pier A was the headquarters of Marine Fire Company 1,[23][74] which used the fireboat John D. McKean.[74] The pier was also used to commission or re-commission FDNY fireboats, including the John Purroy Mitchel,[75] the Governor Alfred E. Smith,[76] and the John H. Glenn Jr..[77] Marine Fire Company 8, which used the Governor Alfred A. Smith, also docked at Pier A until 1970, when Governor Alfred E. Smith was retired and Marine Co. 8 was disbanded.[78] Most of the decorations on the facade were covered by corrugated iron panels as part of a 1964 renovation.[6][19][26] FDNY commissioner Edward Thompson said at the time: \"Instead of an eyesore, it will be a fond sight for the people passing through the harbor.\"[26]\nBy 1966, the New York City Planning Commission sought to preserve piers A and 1, as they were part of the \"New York cultural milieu\".[79] In 1969, the Battery Park City Authority (BPCA) acquired Pier A as part of its development of the Battery Park City neighborhood, with plans to raze the structure.[6] The first phase of the Battery Park City project, which started in 1971, was to comprise 16 acres (6.5\u00a0ha) from Pier A north to Rector Street.[80] The nonprofit New York Landmarks Conservancy wanted the pier to be saved,[6] and New York City's ports commissioner Edgar C. Fabber and the FDNY's marine division also supported the pier's preservation.[81] Mario Biaggi, a candidate in the 1973 New York City mayoral election, advocated for Pier A to be protected \"as a landmark of beauty and historical significance and as a permanent memorial to American soldiers\".[82]\nThe federal government added Pier A to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in mid-1975.[83][84] The NRHP designation allowed city and state agencies to receive matching funds from the federal government to pay for Pier A's renovation.[83] The next year, the New York State Department of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation and the United States Department of the Interior each provided $90,000 for renovations to the building's foundation, mechanical and electrical systems, and architectural details.[85] By then, Pier A was the oldest pier operating in New York City. The New York Times wrote: \"The plan to rehabilitate the pier is something of a financial anomaly, owing in significant measure to the city\u2019s money problems.\"[85] The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated Pier A as a New York City landmark on July 12, 1977.[86][87] After winning the 1977 New York City mayoral election, Ed Koch intended to restore structures on New York Harbor, starting with Pier A. Koch announced in 1980 that the city government would open a request for proposals for the redevelopment of Pier A.[88] However, the plans did not proceed for several years.[89]\nBy 1987, the Koch administration was considering converting Pier A into a visitor center as part of the planned Harbor Park, a complex of parks around New York Harbor.[90][89][91] That December, the Koch administration proposed relocating the headquarters of the FDNY's Marine Division, a repair shop, and several other offices while keeping Marine Company 1 at Pier A.[92] City officials planned a visitor center on the ground level and restaurants on the upper stories.[93][94] The city opened a request for proposals for Pier A's redevelopment in January 1988,[94] receiving four bids.[95][96] Later that year, the city selected Wings Point Associates as the site developer.[97][98] Another bidder, the Abbracciamento Group, had put forth a more profitable proposal; however, the city rejected the plan because Abbracciamento had wanted to buy a boat and relocate the restaurant there.[98] The other two bidders were Pier A Development Group, which had proposed an upscale restaurant and a fast-food restaurant, and Municipal Quality Partners, which had proposed an upscale restaurant, bookstore, and food bank.[96]\nWings Point signed a 50-year lease on the building and planned to spend $20 million on rehabilitation.[93] The next year, the New York state government gave the city government $4 million for the project.[93] Robert Silman & Associates was hired as the structural engineer for the renovation, while Beyer Blinder Belle was the renovation architect.[6] The FDNY relocated John D. McKean from Pier A at the end of 1991.[99] To facilitate Pier A's redevelopment, in mid-1991, U.S. representative Ted Weiss proposed that the waters around Pier A be declared non-navigable.[100] Because the federal government could easily condemn a structure in navigable waters, it was difficult to obtain financing for such structures, including Pier A.[100] Simultaneously, the city was planning to construct Hudson River Park along the riverfront, connecting Pier A with the new Battery Park City neighborhood.[101][102]\nBy early 1993, the developers planned to begin renovating Pier A later that year.[6] However, work remained stalled for several years because of a lack of funds and Wings Point's refusal to accept chain stores as tenants.[103] Work started in June 1997 after the New York City Industrial Development Agency issued $8 million worth of bonds; by then, the cost had risen to $27 million.[104] As late as April 1999, Pier A was planned to open by the end of that year.[105] A replica of the slave ship La Amistad was temporarily docked at Pier A in July 2000,[106] but the pier was otherwise unused and decrepit during the early 2000s, except for its clock tower.[107]\nAfter the September 11 attacks in 2001 caused severe disruptions to the city's transportation system, the city and state governments built a temporary dock for commuter ferries at Pier A,[108][109] constructing six slips within six weeks of the attack.[110] The city and state governments allowed NY Waterway to operate ferries there.[111] New York Water Taxi also started serving Pier A in late 2002,[112][113] as part of an expansion of ferry service in New York City after the September 11 attacks.[114] New York governor George Pataki announced in January 2003 that the Battery Park City Authority (BPCA) would buy out Pier A to speed up the redevelopment process.[115] At the time, the National Park Service (NPS), which conducted security screenings of Liberty Island and Ellis Island visitors at the nearby Castle Clinton, wished to relocate its security-screening facility to Pier A.[116][117] The same year, Wings Point sued NY Waterway because the latter company had not paid landing fees to use Pier A.[111]\nWilliam B. Wachtel of Wings Point formed the BillyBey Ferry Company in early 2005 to take over NY Waterway's Lower Manhattan operations,[118] and he tentatively planned to launch New York Harbor sightseeing cruises from Pier A.[119] NY Waterway had planned to start operating sightseeing cruises from Pier A in April 2006, but the EDC did not allow NY Waterway to use the pier.[120] Arnie Geller presented a competing plan to open an RMS Titanic museum at Pier A,[121] and the BPCA also wanted to acquire the pier.[122] The NPS was still planning to relocate its security-screening facilities to Pier A, but the plan was delayed because of disputes between the EDC and Wings Point.[123] The city government entered a tentative agreement with the NPS in April 2007 and, a few months later, acquired Wings Point's lease for $8 million.[124]\nThe BPCA leased the pier from the city for 49 years in May 2008,[125][126] paying a nominal fee of $1 a year.[127] The BPCA hoped to convert Pier A into a transportation hub[127][128] and negotiated with the NPS to relocate its security-screening facilities to Pier A.[125][129] The NPS reneged from this plan in 2009,[130] expressing concerns over the cost and timeline of Pier A's renovation.[129] The BPCA made several modifications to Pier A between 2008 and 2013, including repairing the masonry foundations, replacing the roof, and installing modern electrical and plumbing systems.[22]\nAfter the NPS withdrew from its plan to lease Pier A, four bidders submitted proposals to the BPCA for a renovation of the structure.[131] The bidders included Peter Poulakakos, who wished to convert the pier into a restaurant,[132] and Joseph J. Grano Jr., who proposed an Italian heritage museum at the pier.[131] The BPCA voted in March 2011 to lease the pier to Poulakakos for 25 years,[133][134][135] prompting objections over the secretive nature of the BPCA's selection process.[132] Poulakakos said his father had been interested in the structure since the 1970s.[136] Poulakakos and his partners would pay $41 million over the duration of their lease. Under the terms of the lease, if the restaurant's gross revenue exceeded $18 million, the BPCA would share eight percent of any gross revenue exceeding $18 million.[27][137] By that time, Pier A was abandoned and decrepit.[138] Poulakakos hoped to open the restaurant by late 2012,[135] and he started renovating the building in partnership with the Dermot Company.[22][139]\nThe $20 million renovation was delayed by several months after Hurricane Sandy flooded Pier A in late 2012, causing $4.3 million in damage.[22] In the hurricane's aftermath, the architects relocated the mechanical equipment to the second floor,[27] and they installed water-resistant mahogany and removable furniture on the first floor.[22] The architects also added maritime-themed decorations to the building.[140] The BPCA transferred control of Pier A to Poulakakos in mid-2013, although the agency was still responsible for constructing a plaza outside the building, work on which had been delayed by a lack of funding.[141] The New York City government allocated $5 million for the plaza's development.[22] The renovation ultimately cost about $40 million.[142][137] The city government spent $30 million on the restoration of Pier A, while the Battery Park Authority spent $7 million on Pier A and $5 million on the plaza.[27] Pier A Harbor House opened to the public in November 2014,[143][144] more than three decades after the redevelopment project had started.[27][30] The ground-floor space opened first, followed by the upper-floor spaces.[27][30] The Blacktail Bar, a Cuban bar on Pier A's second story,[145][146] opened in August 2016[145][147] and operated until January 2020.[148]\nHarbor House closed in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.[116][137] The BPCA sought to reopen Harbor House,[149] but the restaurant ultimately never opened again, even as Poulakakos continued to operate other restaurants in New York City.[137][150] A group of investors with EB-5 visas, who had provided $16.5 million for Pier A's renovation, sued Poulakako to recoup their investment.[137] Although the BPCA was willing to terminate Harbor House's 25-year lease ahead of schedule, the EB-5 investors were uninterested in taking over the pier.[116] By 2021, there were several proposals to reopen Pier A.[151] Statue Cruises, which operated ferries to Liberty and Ellis islands, proposed relocating its ferry dock to Pier A, as Statue Cruises' existing dock at Castle Clinton was deteriorating.[152][153] As part of the Lower Manhattan Coastal Resiliency Project, in 2022, the BPCA proposed converting Pier A Plaza into a two-story park to protect the surrounding neighborhood from rising sea levels.[11][154] Pier A Plaza was to contain retractable flood barriers on its upper level, as well as wooden benches, trees, and brick structures that could withstand prolonged flooding.[11]", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Pier_A", "

Island - Wikipedia": {"text": "Tompkinsville is a neighborhood in northeastern Staten Island in New York City. Named for Daniel D. Tompkins, sixth Vice President of the United States (1817-1825), the neighborhood sits on the island's eastern shore, along the waterfront facing Upper New York Bay, between St. George on the north and Stapleton on the south; however, it is considered part of the North Shore by the island's residents.[citation needed]\nTompkinsville, located in the Town of Castleton, was the site where early European explorers replenished their fresh water supplies and was known in colonial times as the \"Watering Place\". It was opposite the Watering Place that the then largest British expeditionary force, with 450 ships and 32,000 soldiers, arrived in Upper New York Bay and landed in advance of the American Revolutionary War.[1] In 1799, the New York state government took 30 acres (12\u00a0ha) along the waterfront, upon which it established the New York Marine Hospital (also \"The Quarantine\"), a contagious disease hospital[2][3] and quarantine station.\nIn 1815, a settlement was established by New York state governor, Daniel D. Tompkins, in the neighborhood next to the hospital. He was elected Vice President the following year. In 1817 Tompkins built a dock at the foot of present-day Victory Boulevard and began offering steam ferry service to Manhattan.[4] Angry residents burned down the Quarantine in 1858 in a series of attacks known as the Staten Island Quarantine War. Although there were no deaths as a result of the attack, the arsonists completely destroyed the hospital compound.[3]\nIn the early 1900s, the telephone exchange that served Staten Island's eastern North Shore was named after the neighborhood; the name of this exchange was changed to \"Saint George\" in the mid-1920s, and to \"Saint George 7\" when New York Telephone upgraded telephone service throughout New York City in December 1930. Converted for All-Number Calling, \"727\" still exists on the island today. It is the sole surviving number of the designations of the 1920s.\nTompkinsville was the site of a Naval Frontier Base of the US Navy for many years. The base was particularly active during the US engagement with World War I. On 8 July 1919 a delegation consisting of: Vice President Thomas R. Marshall; Josephus Daniels, the Secretary of the Navy; Carter Glass, the Secretary of the Treasury; William B. Wilson, the Secretary of Labor; Newton D. Baker, the Secretary of War; Franklin K. Lane, the Secretary of the Interior; and Senator Champ Clark came aboard the USS Pennsylvania (BB-38) for a cruise back to New York with President Wilson.\nDuring World War II, it was designated Tompkinsville, SI, New York.\nIn the 21st century, Tompkinsville became a racially mixed area,[5] and a little Sri Lanka had developed.[6] There is also a large population of Italian-Americans, African Americans and Mexicans.  In 2014, black Staten Island resident Eric Garner was killed by police in Tompkinsville, in an incident that received widespread media coverage.[7]\nIn 2019, the section of Bay Street in Tompkinsville was rezoned to allow for a higher concentration of residential, commercial, and office space along the street.[8][9] The plan was controversial, as the vast majority of Staten Island Community Board 1 members had rejected the plan,[10] as did many residents of Tompkinsville,[5] and the commissioners of the New York City Planning Commission had mixed opinions.[11]\nTompkinsville contains an enclave of Sri Lankans.[6] The neighborhood also hosts a number of live music and art venues, including Everything Goes Book Caf\u00e9, Deep Tanks Studio, Coyle Cavern, Ink Chyx Tattoo & Art Gallery, and the Staten Island LGBT Community Center, all of which take part in the north shore's monthly Second Saturday art walk.[12] As with much of the north shore, the area is decidedly more urban than is typical of Staten Island, evinced in the architecture (predominantly tall brick buildings) and numerous retail stores and eateries. Unlike many other North Shore communities (and like Port Richmond), the neighborhood has no public housing projects. Its housing stock is dominated by single-family homes built in the first few decades of the 20th century.\nThe neighborhood is mixed commercial and residential. Like many areas of the northeastern part of the island, it suffered a decline following the construction of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge in 1964, which shifted the commercial activity of the island towards its interior. Recent plans have called for the redevelopment of the harbor front area. The population is racially diverse, primarily made up of African-Americans, Hispanics, and Whites, with recent arrivals including immigrants from such countries as Albania. Tompkinsville also contains a Little Sri Lanka, one of the largest Sri Lankan communities outside of the country of Sri Lanka itself.[13][14] The neighborhood also has a growing Mexican community.\nThe Tompkinsville station of the Staten Island Railway is one stop south of the terminus at St. George. Unlike at the majority of the railway's stations, a MetroCard or OMNY must be used to enter or exit at Tompkinsville. Faregates were installed at the station in 2009 to deter fare avoiders who would exit at the station to avoid paying the fare at St. George.[15][16]\nCoordinates: 40\u00b038\u203202\u2033N

(/\u02c8\u0261r\u025bn\u026at\u0283/ GREN-itch, /\u02c8\u0261r\u026an-/ GRIN-, /-\u026ad\u0292/ -\u2060ij),[4] or simply The Village, is a neighborhood on the west side of Lower Manhattan in New York City, bounded by 14th Street to the north, Broadway to the east, Houston Street to the south, and the Hudson River to the west. Greenwich Village also contains several subsections, including the West Village west of Seventh Avenue and the Meatpacking District in the northwest corner of Greenwich Village.\nIts name comes from Groenwijck, Dutch for \"Green District\".[5][a] In the 20th century, Greenwich Village was known as an artists' haven, the bohemian capital, the cradle of the modern LGBT movement, and the East Coast birthplace of both the Beat and '60s counterculture movements. Greenwich Village contains Washington Square Park, as well as two of New York City's private colleges, New York University (NYU) and The New School.[7][8]\nGreenwich Village is part of Manhattan Community District 2, and is patrolled by the 6th Precinct of the New York City Police Department.[1] Greenwich Village has undergone extensive gentrification and commercialization;[9] the four ZIP Codes that constitute the Village \u2013 10011, 10012, 10003, and 10014 \u2013 were all ranked among the ten most expensive in the United States by median housing price in 2014, according to Forbes,[10] with residential property sale prices in the West Village neighborhood typically exceeding US$2,100/sq\u00a0ft ($23,000/m2) in 2017.[11]\nThe neighborhood is bordered by Broadway to the east, the North River (part of the Hudson River) to the west, Houston Street to the south, and 14th Street to the north. It is roughly centered on Washington Square Park and New York University. Adjacent to Greenwich Village are the neighborhoods of NoHo and the East Village to the east, SoHo and Hudson Square to the south, and Chelsea and Union Square to the north. The East Village was formerly considered part of the Lower East Side and has never been considered a part of Greenwich Village.[12] The western part of Greenwich Village is known as the West Village; the dividing line of its eastern border is debated but commonly cited as Seventh Avenue or Sixth Avenue. The Far West Village is another sub-neighborhood of Greenwich Village that is bordered on its west by the Hudson River and on its east by Hudson Street.[13]\nInto the early 20th century, Greenwich Village was distinguished from the upper-class neighborhood of Washington Square\u2014based on the major landmark of Washington Square Park[14][15] or Empire Ward[16] in the 19th century.\nEncyclop\u00e6dia Britannica's 1956 article on \"New York (City)\" states (under the subheading \"Greenwich Village\") that the southern border of the Village is Spring Street, reflecting an earlier understanding. Today, Spring Street overlaps with the modern, newer SoHo neighborhood designation, while the modern Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica cites the southern border as Houston Street.[17]\nAs Greenwich Village was once a rural, isolated hamlet to the north of the 17th century European settlement on Manhattan Island, its street layout is more organic than the planned grid pattern of the 19th century grid plan (based on the Commissioners' Plan of 1811). Greenwich Village was allowed to keep the 18th century street pattern of what is now called the West Village: areas that were already built up when the plan was implemented, west of what is now Greenwich Avenue and Sixth Avenue, resulted in a neighborhood whose streets are dramatically different, in layout, from the ordered structure of the newer parts of Manhattan.[18]\nMany of the neighborhood's streets are narrow and some curve at odd angles. This is generally regarded as adding to both the historic character and charm of the neighborhood. In addition, as the meandering Greenwich Street used to be on the Hudson River shoreline, much of the neighborhood west of Greenwich Street is on landfill, but still follows the older street grid.[18] When Sixth and Seventh Avenues were extended in the early 20th century, they were built diagonally to the existing street plan, and many older, smaller streets had to be demolished.[18]\nUnlike the streets of most of Manhattan above Houston Street, streets in the Village are typically named rather than numbered. While some of the formerly named streets (including Factory, Herring and Amity Streets) are now numbered, they still do not always conform to the usual grid pattern when they enter the neighborhood.[18] For example, West 4th Street runs east\u2013west across most of Manhattan, but runs north\u2013south in Greenwich Village, causing it to intersect with West 10th, 11th, and 12th Streets before ending at West 13th Street.[18]\nA large section of Greenwich Village, made up of more than 50 northern and western blocks in the area up to 14th Street, is part of a Historic District established by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. The District's convoluted borders run no farther south than 4th Street or St. Luke's Place, and no farther east than Washington Square East or University Place.[19] Redevelopment in that area is severely restricted, and developers must preserve the main fa\u00e7ade and aesthetics of the buildings during renovation.\nMost of the buildings of Greenwich Village are mid-rise apartments, 19th century row houses, and the occasional one-family walk-up, a sharp contrast to the high-rise landscape in Midtown and Downtown Manhattan.\nPolitically, Greenwich Village is in New York's 10th congressional district.[20][21] It is also in the New York State Senate's 25th district,[22][23] the New York State Assembly's 66th district,[24][25] and the New York City Council's 3rd district.[26]\nIn the 16th century, Lenape referred to its farthest northwest corner, by the cove on the Hudson River at present-day Gansevoort Street, as Sapokanikan (\"tobacco field\"). The land was cleared and turned into pasture by Dutch and their slaves, who named their settlement Noortwyck (also spelled Noortwijck, \"North district\", equivalent to \u2018Northwich/Northwick\u2019). In the 1630s, Governor Wouter van Twiller farmed tobacco on 200 acres (0.81\u00a0km2) here at his \"Farm in the Woods\".[27] The English conquered the Dutch settlement of New Netherland in 1664, and Greenwich Village developed as a hamlet separate from the larger New York City to the south on land that would eventually become the Financial District. In 1644, the eleven Dutch African settlers in the area were freed after the first Black legal protest in America.[b] All received parcels of land in what is now Greenwich Village,[28] in an area that became known as the Land of the Blacks.\nThe earliest known reference to the village's name as \"Greenwich\" dates back to 1696, in the will of Yellis Mandeville of Greenwich; however, the village was not mentioned in the city records until 1713.[29] Sir Peter Warren began accumulating land in 1731 and built a frame house capacious enough to hold sittings of the New York General Assembly when smallpox rendered the city dangerous in 1739 and subsequent years; on one occasion in 1746, the house of Mordecai Gomez was used.[30][31] Warren's house, which survived until the Civil War era, overlooked the North River from a bluff; its site on the block bounded by Perry and Charles Streets, Bleecker and West 4th Streets,[32] can still be recognized by its mid-19th century rowhouses inserted into a neighborhood still retaining many houses of the 1830\u201337 boom.\nFrom 1797[33] until 1829,[34] the bucolic village of Greenwich was the location of New York State's first penitentiary, Newgate Prison, on the Hudson River at what is now West 10th Street,[33] near the Christopher Street pier.[35] The building was designed by Joseph-Fran\u00e7ois Mangin, who would later co-design New York City Hall.[36] Although the intention of its first warden, Quaker prison reformer Thomas Eddy, was to provide a rational and humanitarian place for retribution and rehabilitation, the prison soon became an overcrowded and pestilent place, subject to frequent riots by the prisoners which damaged the buildings and killed some inmates.[33] By 1821, the prison, designed for 432 inmates, held 817 instead, a number made possible only by the frequent release of prisoners, sometimes as many as 50 a day.[37] Since the prison was north of the New York City boundary at the time, being sentenced to Newgate became known as being \"sent up the river\". This term became popularized once prisoners started being sentenced to Sing Sing Prison, in the town of Ossining upstream of New York City.[35]\nThe oldest house remaining in Greenwich Village is the Isaacs-Hendricks House, at 77 Bedford Street (built 1799, much altered and enlarged 1836, third story 1928).[38] When the Church of St. Luke in the Fields was founded in 1820, it stood in fields south of the road (now Christopher Street) that led from Greenwich Lane (now Greenwich Avenue) down to a landing on the North River. In 1822, a yellow fever epidemic in New York encouraged residents to flee to the healthier air of Greenwich Village, and afterwards many stayed. The future site of Washington Square was a potter's field from 1797 to 1823 when up to 20,000 of New York's poor were buried here, and still remain. The handsome Greek revival rowhouses on the north side of Washington Square were built about 1832, establishing the fashion of Washington Square and lower Fifth Avenue for decades to come. Well into the 19th century, the district of Washington Square was considered separate from Greenwich Village.\nGreenwich Village historically was known as an important landmark on the map of American bohemian culture in the early and mid-20th century. The neighborhood was known for its colorful, artistic residents and the alternative culture they propagated. Due in part to the progressive attitudes of many of its residents, the Village was a focal point of new movements and ideas, whether political, artistic, or cultural. This tradition as an enclave of avant-garde and alternative culture was established during the 19th century and continued into the 20th century, when small presses, art galleries, and experimental theater thrived. In 1969, enraged members of the gay community, in search for equality, started the Stonewall riots. The Stonewall Inn was later recognized as a National Historic Landmark for having been the location where the gay rights movement originated.[39][40][41]\nThe Tenth Street Studio Building was situated at 51 West 10th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. The building was commissioned by James Boorman Johnston[c] and designed by Richard Morris Hunt. Its innovative design soon represented a national architectural prototype, and featured a domed central gallery, from which interconnected rooms radiated. Hunt's studio within the building housed the first architectural school in the United States. Soon after its completion in 1857, the building helped to make Greenwich Village central to the arts in New York City, drawing artists from all over the country to work, exhibit, and sell their art. In its initial years Winslow Homer took a studio there,[43] as did Edward Lamson Henry, and many of the artists of the Hudson River School, including Frederic Church and Albert Bierstadt.[44]\nFrom the late 19th century until the present, the Hotel Albert has served as a cultural icon of Greenwich Village. Opened during the 1880s and originally located at 11th Street and University Place, called the Hotel St. Stephan and then, after 1902, called the Hotel Albert while under the ownership of William Ryder, it served as a meeting place, restaurant and dwelling for several important artists and writers from the late 19th century well into the 20th century. After 1902, the owner's brother Albert Pinkham Ryder lived and painted there. Some other noted guests who lived there include: Augustus St. Gaudens, Robert Louis Stevenson, Mark Twain, Hart Crane, Walt Whitman, Ana\u00efs Nin, Thomas Wolfe, Robert Lowell, Horton Foote, Salvador Dal\u00ed, Philip Guston, Jackson Pollock, and Andy Warhol.[45][46] During the golden age of bohemianism, Greenwich Village became famous for such eccentrics as Joe Gould (profiled at length by Joseph Mitchell) and Maxwell Bodenheim, dancer Isadora Duncan, writer William Faulkner, and playwright Eugene O'Neill. Political rebellion also made its home here, whether serious (John Reed) or frivolous (Marcel Duchamp and friends set off balloons from atop Washington Square Arch, proclaiming the founding of \"The Independent Republic of Greenwich Village\" on January 24, 1917).[47][48]\nIn 1924, the Cherry Lane Theatre was established. Located at 38 Commerce Street, it is New York City's oldest continuously running Off-Broadway theater. A landmark in Greenwich Village's cultural landscape, it was built as a farm silo in 1817, and also served as a tobacco warehouse and box factory before Edna St. Vincent Millay and other members of the Provincetown Players converted the structure into a theatre they christened the Cherry Lane Playhouse, which opened on March 24, 1924, with the play The Man Who Ate the Popomack. During the 1940s The Living Theatre, Theatre of the Absurd, and the Downtown Theater movement all took root there, and it developed a reputation as a showcase for aspiring playwrights and emerging voices.\nIn one of the many Manhattan properties that Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney and her husband owned, Gertrude Whitney established the Whitney Studio Club at 8 West 8th Street in 1914, as a facility where young artists could exhibit their works. By the 1930s it had evolved into her greatest legacy, the Whitney Museum of American Art, on the site of today's New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture. The Whitney was founded in 1931, as an answer to the Museum of Modern Art, founded 1928, and its collection of mostly European modernism and its neglect of American Art. Gertrude Whitney decided to put the time and money into the museum after the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art turned down her offer to contribute her twenty-five-year collection of modern art works.[50] In 1936, the renowned Abstract Expressionist artist and teacher Hans Hofmann moved his art school from East 57th Street to 52 West 9th Street. In 1938, Hofmann moved again to a more permanent home at 52 West 8th Street. The school remained active until 1958, when Hofmann retired from teaching.[51]\nOn January 8, 1947, stevedore Andy Hintz was fatally shot by hitmen John M. Dunn, Andrew Sheridan, and Danny Gentile in front of his apartment. Before he died on January 29, he told his wife that \"Johnny Dunn shot me.\"[52] The three gunmen were immediately arrested. Sheridan and Dunn were executed.[53]\nThe Village hosted the nation's first racially integrated nightclub,[54] when Caf\u00e9 Society was opened in 1938 at 1 Sheridan Square[55] by Barney Josephson. Caf\u00e9 Society showcased African American talent and was intended to be an American version of the political cabarets that Josephson had seen in Europe before World War I. Notable performers there included: Pearl Bailey, Count Basie, Nat King Cole, John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Ella Fitzgerald, Coleman Hawkins, Billie Holiday, Lena Horne, Burl Ives, Lead Belly, Anita O'Day, Charlie Parker, Les Paul and Mary Ford, Paul Robeson, Kay Starr, Art Tatum, Sarah Vaughan, Dinah Washington, Josh White, Teddy Wilson, Lester Young, and the Weavers, who also in Christmas 1949, played at the Village Vanguard.\nThe annual Greenwich Village Halloween Parade, initiated in 1974 by Greenwich Village puppeteer and mask maker Ralph Lee, is the world's largest Halloween parade and America's only major Halloween nighttime parade, attracting more than 60,000 costumed participants, two million in-person spectators, and a worldwide television audience of over 100 million.[56] The parade has its roots in New York\u2019s queer community.[49]\nGreenwich Village again became important to the bohemian scene during the 1950s, when the Beat Generation focused their energies there. Fleeing from what they saw as oppressive social conformity, a loose collection of writers, poets, artists, and students (later known as the Beats) and the Beatniks, moved to Greenwich Village, and to North Beach in San Francisco, in many ways creating the U.S. East Coast and West Coast predecessors, respectively, to the East Village-Haight Ashbury hippie scene of the next decade. The Village (and surrounding New York City) would later play central roles in the writings of, among others, Maya Angelou, James Baldwin, William S. Burroughs, Truman Capote, Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, Rod McKuen, Marianne Moore, and Dylan Thomas, who collapsed at the Chelsea Hotel, and died at St. Vincents Hospital at 170 West 12th Street, in the Village after drinking at the White Horse Tavern on November 5, 1953.\nOff-Off-Broadway began in Greenwich Village in 1958 as a reaction to Off Broadway, and a \"complete rejection of commercial theatre\".[57] Among the first venues for what would soon be called \"Off-Off-Broadway\" (a term supposedly coined by critic Jerry Tallmer of the Village Voice) were coffeehouses in Greenwich Village, in particular, the Caffe Cino at 31 Cornelia Street, operated by the eccentric Joe Cino, who early on took a liking to actors and playwrights and agreed to let them stage plays there without bothering to read the plays first, or to even find out much about the content. Also integral to the rise of Off-Off-Broadway were Ellen Stewart at La MaMa, originally located at 321 E. 9th Street, and Al Carmines at the Judson Poets' Theater, located at Judson Memorial Church on the south side of Washington Square Park.\nThe Village had a cutting-edge cabaret and music scene. The Village Gate, the Village Vanguard, and the Blue Note (since 1981) regularly hosted some of the biggest names in jazz. Greenwich Village also played a major role in the development of the folk music scene of the 1960s. Music clubs included Gerde's Folk City, The Bitter End, Cafe Au Go Go, Cafe Wha?, The Gaslight Cafe and The Bottom Line. Three of the four members of the Mamas & the Papas met there. Guitarist and folk singer Dave Van Ronk lived there for many years. Village resident and cultural icon Bob Dylan by the mid-60s had become one of the world's foremost popular songwriters, and often developments in Greenwich Village would influence the simultaneously occurring folk rock movement in San Francisco and elsewhere, and vice versa. Dozens of other cultural and popular icons got their start in the Village's nightclub, theater, and coffeehouse scene during the 1950s, 1960s, and early 1970s. Many artists garnered critical acclaim, some before and some after, performed in the Village. This list includes Eric Andersen, Joan Baez, Jackson Browne, the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem, Richie Havens, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Ian, the Kingston Trio, the Lovin' Spoonful, Bette Midler, Liza Minnelli, Joni Mitchell, Maria Muldaur, Laura Nyro, Phil Ochs, Tom Paxton, Peter, Paul, and Mary, Carly Simon, Simon & Garfunkel, Nina Simone, Barbra Streisand, James Taylor, and the Velvet Underground. The Greenwich Village of the 1950s and 1960s was at the center of Jane Jacobs's book The Death and Life of Great American Cities, which defended it and similar communities, while criticizing common urban renewal policies of the time.\nFounded by New York-based artist Mercedes Matter and her students, the New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture is an art school formed in the mid-1960s in the Village. Officially opened September 23, 1964, the school is still active, at 8 W. 8th Street, the site of the original Whitney Museum of American Art.[58]\nGreenwich Village was home to a safe house used by the radical anti-war movement known as the Weather Underground. On March 6, 1970, their safehouse was destroyed when an explosive device they were constructing was accidentally detonated, killing three of their members (Ted Gold, Terry Robbins, and Diana Oughton).\nThe Village has been a center for movements that challenged the wider American culture, most notably its seminal role in sparking the gay liberation movement. The Stonewall riots were a series of spontaneous, violent protests by members of the gay community against a police raid that took place in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn, 53 Christopher Street. Considered together, the demonstrations are widely considered to constitute the single most important event leading to the gay liberation movement and the modern fight for LGBT rights in the United States.[59][60] On June 23, 2015, the Stonewall Inn was the first landmark in New York City to be recognized by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission on the basis of its status in LGBT history,[61] and on June 24, 2016, the Stonewall National Monument was named the first U.S. National Monument dedicated to the LGBTQ-rights movement.[62] Greenwich Village contains the world's oldest gay and lesbian bookstore, Oscar Wilde Bookshop, founded in 1967, while The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Community Center \u2013 best known as simply \"The Center\" \u2013 has occupied the former Food & Maritime Trades High School at 208 West 13th Street since 1984. In 2006, the Village was the scene of an assault involving seven lesbians and a straight man that sparked appreciable media attention, with strong statements defending both sides of the case.\nSince the end of the 20th century, many artists and local historians have mourned the fact that the bohemian days of Greenwich Village are long gone, because of the extraordinarily high housing costs in the neighborhood.[63] The artists fled to other New York City neighborhoods including SoHo, Tribeca, Dumbo, Williamsburg, and Long Island City. Nevertheless, residents of Greenwich Village still possess a strong community identity and are proud of their neighborhood's unique history and fame, and its well-known liberal live-and-let-live attitudes.[63]\nHistorically, local residents and preservation groups have been concerned about development in the Village and have fought to preserve its architectural and historic integrity. In the 1960s, Margot Gayle led a group of citizens to preserve the Jefferson Market Courthouse (later reused as Jefferson Market Library),[64] while other citizen groups fought to keep traffic out of Washington Square Park,[65] and Jane Jacobs, using the Village as an example of a vibrant urban community, advocated to keep it that way.\nSince then, preservation has been a part of the Village ethos. Shortly after the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) was established in 1965, it acted to protect parts of Greenwich Village, designating the small Charlton-King-Vandam Historic District in 1966, which contains the city's largest concentration of row houses in the Federal style, as well as a significant concentration of Greek Revival houses, and the even smaller MacDougal-Sullivan Gardens Historic District in 1967, a group of 22 houses sharing a common back garden, built in the Greek Revival style and later renovated with Colonial Revival fa\u00e7ades. In 1969, the LPC designated the Greenwich Village Historic District \u2013 which remained the city's largest for four decades \u2013 despite preservationists' advocacy for the entire neighborhood to be designated an historic district. Advocates continued to pursue their goal of additional designation, spurred in particular by the increased pace of development in the 1990s.\nThe Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation (GVSHP), a nonprofit organization dedicated to the architectural and cultural character and heritage of the neighborhood, successfully proposed new districts and individual landmarks to the LPC. Those include:[66]\nThe Landmarks Preservation Commission designated as landmarks several individual sites proposed by the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, including the former Bell Telephone Labs Complex (1861\u20131933), now Westbeth Artists' Housing, designated in 2011;[72] the Silver Towers/University Village Complex (1967), designed by I.M. Pei and including the Picasso sculpture \"Portrait of Sylvette,\" designated in 2008;[73] and three early 19th-century federal houses at 127, 129 and 131 MacDougal Street.\nSeveral contextual rezonings were enacted in Greenwich Village in recent years to limit the size and height of allowable new development in the neighborhood, and to encourage the preservation of existing buildings. The following were proposed by the GVSHP and passed by the City Planning Commission:\nNew York University and Greenwich Village preservationists have frequently become embroiled in conflicts between the university's campus expansion efforts and the preservation of the scale and character of the Village.[76]\nAs one press critic put it in 2013, \"For decades, New York University has waged architectural war on Greenwich Village.\"[77] In recent years, the university has clashed most prominently with community groups such as the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation over the construction of new NYU academic buildings and residence halls. During the design of Furman Hall in 2000, the site of which is adjacent to the Judson Memorial Church, community groups sued the university, claiming the construction of a 13-story tower on the site would \"loom behind the campanile of [the church]\" and \"mar the historic silhouette of Greenwich Village as viewed from Washington Square Park\". Despite a justice in State Supreme Court dismissing the case, the university agreed to a settlement with the groups to avoid future appeals, which included reducing the building to 9 stories and restoring the facades of two historic houses located on the site, the Judson House and a red-brick town house where Edgar Allan Poe once lived, which NYU reconstructed as they appeared in the 19th century.[78] Another dispute arose during the construction of the 26-story Founders Hall, a residence hall planned to be constructed on the site of St. Ann's Church at 120 East Twelfth Street. Amidst protests of the demolition of the church, the university decided to maintain and restore the facade and steeple of the building, parts of which were deteriorating or missing, and it now stands freely directly in front of the 12th Street entrance of the building. Further controversy also arose over the height of the building, as well as how the university would integrate the church's facade into the building's uses; however, in 2006, NYU began construction and the new dorm was completed in December 2008.[79][80]\nIn recent years, the most conflict has arisen over the proposed NYU 2031 plan, which the university released in 2010 as its plan for long-term growth, both within and outside of Greenwich Village. This included a court battle over the City of New York's right to transfer three plots of Department of Transportation-owned land to the university for constructing staging, which plaintiffs claimed required the consent of the state legislature. Ultimately, the Appellate Division of New York's Supreme Court ruled in the university's favor after a lower court blocked the expansion plan; however, so far, the university has only begun construction on 181 Mercer Street, the first building in the planned 1.5-million-square-foot (140,000\u00a0m2) expansion southwards. [81][82]\nFor census purposes, the New York City government classifies Greenwich Village as part of the West Village neighborhood tabulation area.[83] Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of West Village was 66,880, a change of \u22121,603 (\u22122.4%) from the 68,483 counted in 2000. Covering an area of 583.47 acres (236.12\u00a0ha), the neighborhood had a population density of 114.6/acre (73,300/sq\u00a0mi; 28,300/km2).[84] The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 80.9% (54,100) White, 2% (1,353) African American, 0.1% (50) Native American, 8.2% (5,453) Asian, 0% (20) Pacific Islander, 0.4% (236) from other races, and 2.4% (1,614) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 6.1% (4,054) of the population.[85]\nThe entirety of Community District 2, which comprises Greenwich Village and SoHo, had 91,638 inhabitants as of NYC Health's 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 85.8 years.[86]:\u200a2,\u200a20\u200a This is higher than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods.[87]:\u200a53 (PDF p. 84)\u200a[88] Most inhabitants are adults: a plurality (42%) are between the ages of 25\u201344, while 24% are between 45 and 64, and 15% are 65 or older. The ratio of youth and college-aged residents was lower, at 9% and 10%, respectively.[86]:\u200a2\nAs of 2017, the median household income in Community Districts 1 and 2 (including the Financial District and Tribeca) was $144,878,[89] though the median income in Greenwich Village individually was $119,728.[2] In 2018, an estimated 9% of Greenwich Village and SoHo residents lived in poverty, compared to 14% in all of Manhattan and 20% in all of New York City. One in twenty-five residents (4%) were unemployed, compared to 7% in Manhattan and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 38% in Greenwich Village and SoHo, compared to the boroughwide and citywide rates of 45% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, as of 2018[update], Greenwich Village and SoHo are considered high-income relative to the rest of the city and not gentrifying.[86]:\u200a7\nGreenwich Village includes several collegiate institutions. Since the 1830s, New York University (NYU) has had a campus there. In 1973 NYU moved from its campus in University Heights in the West Bronx (the current site of Bronx Community College), to Greenwich Village with many buildings around Gould Plaza on West 4th Street. In 1976 Yeshiva University established the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in the northern part of Greenwich Village. In the 1980s Hebrew Union College was built in Greenwich Village. The New School, with its Parsons The New School for Design, a division of The New School, and the School's Graduate School expanded in the 2000s, with the renovated, award-winning design of the Sheila C. Johnson Design Center at 66 Fifth Avenue on 13th Street. The Cooper Union is located in Greenwich Village, at Astor Place, near St. Mark's Place on the border of the East Village. Pratt Institute established its latest Manhattan campus in an adaptively reused Brunner & Tryon-designed loft building on 14th Street, east of Seventh Avenue. The university campus building expansion was followed by a gentrification process in the 1980s. There are numerous historic buildings in the neighborhood including Emma Lazarus' former residence on W 10th Street[90] and Edward Hopper's former studio which now houses the NYU Silver School of Social Work.[91]\nThe historic Washington Square Park is the center and heart of the neighborhood. Additionally, the Village has several other, smaller parks: Christopher, Father Fagan, Little Red Square, Minetta Triangle, Petrosino Square, and Time Landscape. There are also city playgrounds, including DeSalvio Playground, Minetta, Thompson Street, Bleecker Street, Downing Street, Mercer Street, Cpl. John A. Seravelli, and William Passannante Ballfield. One of the most famous courts, is \"The Cage\", officially known as the West Fourth Street Courts. Sitting atop the West 4th St\u2013Washington Square subway station at Sixth Avenue, the courts are used by basketball and American handball players from across the city. The Cage has become one of the most important tournament sites for the citywide \"Streetball\" amateur basketball tournament. Since 1975, New York University's art collection has been housed at the Grey Art Gallery bordering Washington Square Park, at 100 Washington Square East. The Grey Art Gallery is notable for its museum-quality exhibitions of contemporary art.\nThe Village has a bustling performing arts scene. It is home to many Off Broadway and Off-Off-Broadway theaters; for instance, Blue Man Group has taken up residence in the Astor Place Theater.

Wikipedia": {"text": "Coordinates: 40\u00b045\u203200\u2033N 73\u00b050\u203251\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff40.75000\u00b0N 73.84750\u00b0W\ufeff / 40.75000; -73.84750\nThe US Open Tennis Championships is a hardcourt tennis tournament held annually in Queens, New York. Since 1987, the US Open has been chronologically the fourth and final Grand Slam tournament of the year. The other three, in chronological order, are the Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon. The US Open starts on the last Monday of August and continues for two weeks, with the middle weekend coinciding with the US Labor Day holiday. The tournament is of one of the oldest tennis championships in the world, originally known as the U.S. National Championship, for which men's singles and men's doubles were first played in August 1881. It is the only Grand Slam that was not affected by cancellation of World War I and World War II or interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.\nThe tournament consists of five primary championships: men's and women's singles, men's and women's doubles, and mixed doubles. The tournament also includes events for senior, junior, and wheelchair players. Since 1978, the tournament has been played on acrylic hardcourts at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows\u2013Corona Park, Queens, New York City. The US Open is owned and organized by the United States Tennis Association (USTA), a non-profit organization, and the chairperson of the US Open is Patrick Galbraith. Revenue from ticket sales, sponsorships, and television contracts is used to develop tennis in the United States.\nThis tournament, from 1971 to 2021, employed standard tiebreakers (first to 7 points, win by 2) in every set of a singles match.[2] Since 2022, new tiebreak rules were initiated and standardised in the final set for all four Grand Slams. Thus, when a match reaches 6\u2013all in the last possible set (the third for women and fifth for men), an extended tiebreaker (first to 10 points, win by 2) is played. Hence, should the tiebreaker be even at 9-all, whoever scores two straight points wins the match and/or championship.\nThe tournament was first held in August 1881 on grass courts at the Newport Casino in Newport, Rhode Island, which is now home to the International Tennis Hall of Fame. That year, only clubs that were members of the United States National Lawn Tennis Association (USNLTA) were permitted to enter.[3] Richard Sears won the men's singles at this tournament, which was the first of his seven consecutive singles titles.[4] From 1884 through 1911, the tournament used a challenge system whereby the defending champion automatically qualified for the next year's final, where he would play the winner of the all-comers tournament.\nIn the first years of the U.S. National Championship, only men competed and the tournament was known as the U.S. National Singles Championships for Men. In September 1887, six years after the men's nationals were first held, the first U.S. Women's National Singles Championship was held at the Philadelphia Cricket Club. The winner was 17-year-old Philadelphian Ellen Hansell. In that same year, the men's doubles event was played at the Orange Lawn Tennis Club in South Orange, New Jersey.[5]\nThe women's tournament used a challenge system from 1888 through 1918, except in 1917. Between 1890 and 1906, sectional tournaments were held in the east and the west of the country to determine the best two doubles teams, which competed in a play-off for the right to compete against the defending champions in the challenge round.[6]\nThe 1888 and the 1889 men's doubles events were played at the Staten Island Cricket Club in Livingston, Staten Island, New York.[7]\nIn the 1893 Championship, the men's doubles event was played at the St. George Cricket Club in Chicago.[8][9][10] In 1892, the US Mixed Doubles Championship was introduced and in 1899 the US Women's National Doubles Championship.\nIn 1915, the national championship was relocated to the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills, Queens, New York City. The effort to relocate it to New York City began as early as 1911 when a group of tennis players, headed by New Yorker Karl Behr, started working on it.[11]\nIn early 1915, a group of about 100 tennis players signed a petition in favor of moving the tournament. They argued that most tennis clubs, players, and fans were located in the New York City area and that it would therefore be beneficial for the development of the sport to host the national championship there.[12] This view was opposed by another group of players that included eight former national singles champions.[13][14] This contentious issue was brought to a vote at the annual USNLTA meeting on February 5, 1915, with 128 votes in favor of and 119 against relocation.[15][16][17] In August 1915, the men's singles tournament was held in the West Side Tennis Club, Forest Hills in New York City for the first time while the women's tournament was held in Philadelphia Cricket Club in Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia (the women's singles event was not moved until 1921). From 1917 to 1933, the men's doubles event was held in Longwood Cricket Club in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts. In 1934, both men's and women's doubles events were held in Longwood Cricket Club.[18]\nFrom 1921 through 1923, the men's singles tournament was played at the Germantown Cricket Club in Philadelphia.[19] It returned to the West Side Tennis Club in 1924 following completion of the 14,000-seat Forest Hills Stadium.[6]\nAlthough many already regarded it as a major championship, the International Lawn Tennis Federation officially designated it as one of the world's major tournaments commencing in 1924.[20] At the 1922 U.S. National Championships, the draw seeded players for the first time to prevent the leading players from playing each other in the early rounds.[21][22] From 1935 to 1941 and from 1946 to 1967, the men's and women's doubles were held at the Longwood Cricket Club.[23]\nThe open era began in 1968 when professional tennis players were allowed to compete for the first time at the Grand Slam tournament held at the West Side Tennis Club. The previous U.S. National Championships had been limited to amateur players. Except for mixed doubles,[citation needed] all events at the 1968 national tournament were open to professionals. That year, 96 men and 63 women entered, and prize money totaled $100,000. In 1970, the US Open became the first Grand Slam tournament to use a tiebreaker to decide a set that reached a 6\u20136 score in games. From 1970 through 1974, the US Open used a best-of-nine-point sudden-death tiebreaker before moving to the International Tennis Federation's (ITF) best-of-twelve points system.[4] In 1973, the US Open became the first Grand Slam tournament to award equal prize money to men and women, with that year's singles champions, John Newcombe and Margaret Court, receiving $25,000 each.[4] From 1975, following complaints about the surface and its impact on the ball's bounce, the tournament played on clay courts instead of grass. This was also an experiment to make it more \"TV friendly\". The addition of floodlights allowed matches to be played at night.[24][25]\nIn 1978, the tournament moved from the West Side Tennis Club to the larger and newly constructed USTA National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows, Queens, 3 miles (4.8\u00a0km) to the north. The tournament's court surface also switched from clay to hard. Jimmy Connors is the only individual to have won US Open singles titles on three surfaces (grass, clay, and hard), while Chris Evert is the only woman to win US Open singles titles on two surfaces (clay and hard).[4]\nThe US Open is the only Grand Slam tournament that has been played every year since its inception.[26]\nDuring the 2006 US Open, the complex was renamed to \"USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center\" in honor of Billie Jean King, a four-time US Open singles champion and women's tennis pioneer.[27]\nFrom 1984 through 2015, the US Open deviated from the traditional scheduling patterns of tennis tournaments, by scheduling its women's and men's finals on the last Saturday and Sunday of the tournament respectively, with their semi-finals each held one day prior. The women's final was originally played between the two men's semi-finals, creating a block that came to be known as \"Super Saturday\". Beginning in 2001, the women's final was moved to prime time to encourage television viewership, citing a major growth in popularity for women's tennis among viewers.[28] The concept proved divisive among players because it only gave them less than a day's rest between the semifinal and championship matches. A number of spectators also tended to leave after the women's final, and not stay for the second men's semifinal.[29][30]\nFor five consecutive tournaments between 2008 through 2012, the men's final was postponed to Monday due to weather. In 2013 and 2014, the USTA intentionally scheduled the men's final on a Monday\u2014a move praised for allowing the men's players an extra day's rest following the semifinals, but drew the ire of the ATP for further deviating from the structure of the other Grand Slams.[31][29] In 2015, the Super Saturday concept was dropped, and the US Open returned to a format similar to the other Grand Slams, with women's and men's finals on Saturday and Sunday. However, weather delays forced both sets of semifinals to be held on Friday that year.[32][30]\nIn 2018, the tournament was the first Grand Slam tournament that introduced the shot clock to keep a check on the time consumed by players between points.[d] The reason for this change was to increase the pace of play.[34] The clock is placed in a position visible to players, the chair umpire and fans.[35] Since 2020, all Grand Slams, ATP, and WTA tournaments apply this technology.[36]\nIn 2020, the event was held without spectators due to the COVID-19 pandemic; the Western & Southern Open was also re-located from Cincinnati in order to create a bio-secure bubble for both events due to their proximity.[37] An announcement that the wheelchair tennis competition would not be held caused controversy, because the USTA did not consult with athletes prior to it, as it had with the players' organizations for the able-bodied competitions. After accusations of discrimination, the USTA was forced to backtrack, admitting that it should have discussed the decision with the wheelchair competitors and offering them either $150,000 to be split between them (compared with $3.3m to be split between the players affected by the cancellation of each of the men's and women's qualifying competition and reductions in the mixed-doubles pool), a competition as part of the Open with 95% of the 2019 prize fund, or a competition to be held at the USTA base in Florida.[38]\nThe grounds of the US Open have 22 outdoor courts (plus 12 practice courts just outside the East Gate) consisting of four \"show courts\" (Arthur Ashe Stadium, Louis Armstrong Stadium, the Grandstand, and Court 17), 13 field courts, and 5 practice courts.\nThe main court is the 23,771-seat[39] Arthur Ashe Stadium, which opened in 1997. A US$180\u00a0million[40] retractable roof was added in 2016.[41] The stadium is named after Arthur Ashe, who won the men's singles title at the inaugural US Open in 1968, the Australian Open in 1970, and Wimbledon in 1975 and who was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1985. The next largest court is the 14,061-seat Louis Armstrong Stadium, which cost US$200\u00a0million to build and opened in 2018.[40] The 6,400-seat lower tier of this stadium is separately ticketed, reserved seating while the 7,661-seat upper tier is general admission and not separately ticketed.[40][42] The third largest court is the 8,125-seat Grandstand in the southwest corner of the grounds, which opened in 2016.[41] Court 17 in the southeast corner of the grounds is the fourth largest stadium. It opened with temporary seating in 2011 and received its permanent seating the following year.[43] It has a seating capacity of 2,800, all of which is general admission and not separately ticketed.[43] It is nicknamed \"The Pit\", partly because the playing surface is sunk 8 feet into the ground.[43][44] The total seating capacity for practice courts P1-P5 is 672 and for competition Courts 4\u201316 is 12,656, itemized as follows:[45]\nAll the courts used by the US Open are illuminated, allowing matches and television coverage to extend into primetime. In 2001, the women's singles final was intentionally scheduled for primetime for the first time. CBS Sports president Sean McManus cited significant public interest in star players Serena Williams and Venus Williams and the good ratings performance of the 1999 women's singles final, which was pushed into primetime by rain delays.[28]\nFrom 1978 to 2019, the US Open was played on a hardcourt surface called Pro DecoTurf. It is a multi-layer cushioned surface and classified by the International Tennis Federation as medium-fast.[46] Each August before the start of the tournament, the courts are resurfaced.[47] In March 2020, the USTA announced that Laykold would become the new court surface supplier beginning with the 2020 tournament.[48]\nSince 2005, all US Open and US Open Series tennis courts have been painted a shade of blue (trademarked as \"US Open Blue\") inside the lines to make it easier for players, spectators, and television viewers to see the ball.[49] The area outside the lines is still painted \"US Open Green\".[49]\nIn 2006, the US Open introduced instant replay reviews of line calls, using the Hawk-Eye computer system. It was the first Grand Slam tournament to use the system.[50] The Open felt the need to implement the system because of the controversial quarterfinal match at the 2004 US Open[citation needed] between Serena Williams and Jennifer Capriati where important line calls and key points went against Williams were picked up and repeatedly shown on TV broadcasting the match and subsequently in various news reports to be clearly incorrect, including one point that was overruled by the chair umpire.[51] Instant replay was available only on the Arthur Ashe Stadium and Louis Armstrong Stadium courts through the 2008 tournament. In 2009, it became available on the Grandstand court.[citation needed] Starting in 2018, all competition courts are outfitted with Hawk-Eye and all matches in the main draws (Men's and Women's Singles and Doubles) follow the same procedure\u00a0\u2013  each player is allowed three incorrect challenges per set, with one more being allowed in a tiebreak. Player challenges were eliminated in 2021, when the tournament became the second Grand Slam to fully incorporate Hawk-Eye Live, where all line calls are made electronically; the previous year's tournament had also incorporated Hawk-Eye Live on all courts except for Arthur Ashe and Louis Armstrong stadiums to reduce personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic.[52]\nIn 2007, JPMorgan Chase renewed its sponsorship of the US Open and, as part of the arrangement, the replay system was renamed to \"Chase Review\" on in-stadium video and television.[53]\nRanking points for the men (ATP) and women (WTA) have varied at the US Open through the years. Below is a series of tables for each of the competitions showing the ranking points on offer for each event:\nThe total prize money for the 2022 US Open was $60,102,000 and is the largest package of all Grand Slams and the largest in tournament history. The package is divided as follows:[54]\nThe men's and women's singles prize money (US$42,628,000) accounts for 70.9 percent of total player base compensation, while men's and women's doubles (US$6,943,200), men's and women's singles qualifying (US$6,259,200), and mixed doubles (US$667,700) account for 11.6 percent, 10.4 percent, and 1.1 percent, respectively. All prize money for the doubles competitions are distributed per team. The prize money for the wheelchair draw amounts to a total of US$1,032,000, which accounts for a total of 1.7 percent of the package, and additional expenses, such as per diem and direct hotel payments of US$2,571,900 accounts for a total of 4.3 percent.[54]\nIn 2012, the USTA agreed to increase the US Open prize money to $50,400,000 by 2017. As a result, the prize money for the 2013 tournament was US$33.6\u00a0million, a record US$8.1\u00a0million increase from 2012. The champions of the 2013 US Open Series also had the opportunity to add US$2.6\u00a0million in bonus prize money, potentially bringing the total 2013 US Open purse to more than US$36\u00a0million.[56] In 2014, the prize money was US$38.3\u00a0million.[57] In 2015, the prize money was raised to US$42.3\u00a0million.[58] In 2021, the USTA set a new record for the highest prize money and total player compensation in the tournament's history with $57,462,000, and also boosted the prize money for the qualifying tournament to $6,000,000, a 66% increase over the package in 2019.[59]\nCarlos Alcaraz, 2022 men's singles champion. It was his first major title.\nIga \u015awi\u0105tek, 2022 women's singles champion. It was her third major title.\nRajeev Ram was part of the 2022 winning men's doubles team. It was his third major title and his second at the US Open.\nJoe Salisbury was part of the 2022 winning men's doubles team. It was his third major title and second at the US Open.\nBarbora Krej\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 was part of the 2022 winning women's doubles team. It was her sixth major title and thus completed the Career Super Slam.\nKate\u0159ina Siniakov\u00e1 was part of the 2022 winning women's doubles team. It was her sixth major title and thus completed the Career Super Slam.\nStorm Sanders was part of the 2022 winning mixed doubles team. It was her first major title.\nJohn Peers was part of the 2022 winning mixed doubles team. It was his second major title.\nThe US Open's website allows viewing of live streaming video, but unlike other Grand Slam tournaments, does not allow watching video on demand. The site also offers live radio coverage.\nESPN took full control of televising the event in 2015. When taking over, ESPN ended 47 years of coverage produced and aired by CBS.[61] ESPN uses ESPN and ESPN2 for broadcasts, while putting outer court coverage on ESPN+.[62] The tournament briefly returned to broadcast television for only a few seconds in 2022, as ABC aired a quad box with a simulcast look in of ESPN2\u2019s coverage multiple times during ABC\u2019s college football coverage.\nExceptions\nSource[65]\nSources: US Open,[67] Record Attendance 2019,[68] City University of New York (CUNY)[69][70]", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "
