{"Bobby Fischer - Wikipedia": {"text": "Robert James Fischer (March 9, 1943\u00a0\u2013 January 17, 2008) was an American  chess grandmaster and the eleventh World Chess Champion. A chess prodigy, he won his first of a record eight US Championships at the age of 14. In 1964, he won with an 11\u20130 score, the only perfect score in the history of the tournament.  Qualifying for the 1972 World Championship, Fischer swept matches with Mark Taimanov and Bent Larsen by 6\u20130 scores. After another qualifying match against Tigran Petrosian, Fischer won the title match against Boris Spassky of the USSR, in Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland. Publicized as a Cold War confrontation between the US and USSR, the match attracted more worldwide interest than any chess championship before or since.\nIn 1975, Fischer refused to defend his title when an agreement could not be reached with FIDE, chess's international governing body, over the match conditions. Consequently, the Soviet challenger Anatoly Karpov was named World Champion by default. Fischer subsequently disappeared from the public eye, though occasional reports of erratic behavior emerged. In 1992, he reemerged to win an unofficial rematch against Spassky. It was held in Yugoslavia, which was under a United Nations embargo at the time. His participation led to a conflict with the US government, which warned Fischer that his participation in the match would violate an executive order imposing US sanctions on Yugoslavia. The US government ultimately issued a warrant for his arrest. After that, Fischer lived as an \u00e9migr\u00e9. In 2004, he was arrested in Japan and held for several months for using a passport that the US government had revoked. Eventually, he was granted Icelandic citizenship by a special act of the Icelandic parliament, allowing him to live there until his death in 2008.\nFischer made numerous lasting contributions to chess. His book My 60 Memorable Games, published in 1969, is regarded as essential reading in chess literature. In the 1990s, he patented a modified chess timing system that added a time increment after each move, now a standard practice in top tournament and match play. He also invented Fischer random chess, also known as Chess960, a chess variant in which the initial position of the pieces is randomized to one of 960 possible positions.\nFischer made numerous antisemitic statements, including Holocaust denial. His antisemitism was a major theme in his public and private remarks, and there has been widespread comment and speculation concerning his psychological condition based on his extreme views and eccentric behavior.\nBobby Fischer was born at Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, on March 9, 1943.[2] His mother, Regina Wender Fischer, was a US citizen,[3][4] born in Switzerland; her parents were Polish Jews.[5][6] Raised in St. Louis, Missouri,[2] Regina became a teacher, a registered nurse, and later a physician.[7]\nAfter graduating from college in her teens, Regina traveled to Germany to visit her brother. It was there she met geneticist and future Nobel Prize winner Hermann Joseph Muller, who persuaded her to move to Moscow to study medicine. She enrolled at I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University, where she met Hans-Gerhardt Fischer, also known as Gerardo Liebscher,[8] a German biophysicist, whom she married in November 1933.[9] In 1938, Hans-Gerhardt and Regina had a daughter, Joan Fischer. The reemergence of antisemitism under Stalin prompted Regina to go with Joan to Paris, where Regina became an English teacher. The threat of a German invasion led her and Joan to go to the United States in 1939. Regina and Hans-Gerhardt had already separated in Moscow, although they did not officially divorce until 1945.[9]\nAt the time of her son's birth, Regina was homeless[10] and shuttled to different jobs and schools around the country to support her family. She engaged in political activism and raised both Bobby and Joan as a single parent.[11][12][13]\nIn 1949, Regina moved the family to Manhattan[14] and the following year to Brooklyn, New York City, where she studied for her master's degree in nursing and subsequently began working in that field.[12]\nIn 2002, Peter Nicholas and Clea Benson of The Philadelphia Inquirer published an investigative report which stated that Bobby Fischer's biological father was actually Paul Nemenyi.[13][15][16]\nNemenyi, a Hungarian mathematician and physicist of Jewish heritage, specialized in continuum mechanics. His work applied geometrical solutions to fluid dynamics. Like Bobby, he was a child prodigy and won the Hungarian national mathematics competition at the age of 17.\nBenson and Nicholas continued their work and gathered additional evidence in court records, personal interviews, and a summary of an FBI investigation written by J. Edgar Hoover, which confirmed their earlier conclusions.[13]\nThroughout the 1950s, the FBI investigated Regina and her circle due to her supposed communist views and due to her time living in Moscow.[17] FBI files note that Hans-Gerhardt Fischer never entered the United States, while recording that Nemenyi took a keen interest in Fischer's upbringing.[15][18][19] Not only were Regina and Nemenyi reported to have had an affair in 1942, but Nemenyi made monthly child support payments to Regina and paid for Bobby's schooling until Paul Nemenyi's death in 1952.[20][21]\nIn March 1949, six-year-old Bobby and his sister Joan learned how to play chess using the instructions from a set bought at a candy store.[22] When Joan lost interest in chess and Regina did not have time to play, Fischer was left to play many of his first games against himself.[23] When the family vacationed at Patchogue, Long Island, New York, that summer, Bobby found a book of old chess games and studied it intensely.[24]\nIn 1950, the family moved to Brooklyn, first to an apartment at the corner of Union Street and Franklin Avenue and later to a two-bedroom apartment at 560 Lincoln Place.[25] It was there that \"Fischer soon became so engrossed in the game that Regina feared he was spending too much time alone.\"[12] As a result, on November 14, 1950, Regina sent a postcard to the Brooklyn Eagle newspaper, seeking to place an ad inquiring whether other children of Bobby's age might be interested in playing chess with him. The paper rejected her ad, because no one could figure out how to classify it, but forwarded her inquiry to Hermann Helms, the \"Dean of American Chess\", who told her that Master Max Pavey, former Scottish champion, would be giving a simultaneous exhibition on January 17, 1951.[26][27] Fischer played in the exhibition. Although he held on for 15 minutes, drawing a crowd of onlookers, he eventually lost to the chess master.[28]\nOne of the spectators was Brooklyn Chess Club President[29] Carmine Nigro, an American chess expert of near master strength and an instructor.[30] Nigro was so impressed with Fischer's play[29] that he introduced him to the club and began teaching him.[31][32][33] Fischer noted of his time with Nigro: \"Mr. Nigro was possibly not the best player in the world, but he was a very good teacher. Meeting him was probably a decisive factor in my going ahead with chess.\"[34]\nNigro hosted Fischer's first chess tournament at his home in 1952.[35] In the summer of 1955, Fischer, then 12 years old, joined the Manhattan Chess Club.[36][37] Fischer's relationship with Nigro lasted until 1956, when Nigro moved away.[38][39]\nIn June 1956, Fischer began attending the Hawthorne Chess Club, based in master John \"Jack\" W. Collins's home.[40] Collins taught chess to children, and has been described as Fischer's teacher,[41][42] but Collins himself suggested that he did not actually teach Fischer,[43] and the relationship might be more accurately described as one of mentorship.[44]\nFischer played thousands of blitz and offhand games with Collins and other strong players, studied the books in Collins' large chess library, and ate almost as many dinners at Collins' home as his own.[45][46][47]\nIn March 1956, the Log Cabin Chess Club of West Orange, New Jersey (based in the home of the club's eccentric multi-millionaire founder and patron Elliott Forry Laucks), took Fischer on a tour to Cuba, where he gave a 12-board simultaneous exhibition at Havana's Capablanca Chess Club, winning ten games and drawing two.[48][49] On this tour the club played a series of matches against other clubs. Fischer played second board, behind International Master Norman Whitaker. Whitaker and Fischer were the club's leading scorers, each scoring 5\u00bd points out of 7 games.[50]\nIn July 1956, Fischer won the US Junior Chess Championship, scoring 8\u00bd/10 at Philadelphia to become the youngest-ever Junior Champion at age 13.[51][52] At the 1956 US Open Chess Championship in Oklahoma City, he scored 8\u00bd/12 to tie for 4th\u20138th places, with Arthur Bisguier winning.[53] In the first Canadian Open Chess Championship at Montreal 1956, he scored 7/10 to tie for 8th\u201312th places, with Larry Evans winning.[54] In November, Fischer played in the 1956 Eastern States Open Championship in Washington, D.C., tying for second with William Lombardy, Nicholas Rossolimo, and Arthur Feuerstein, with Hans Berliner taking first by a half-point.[55]\nFischer accepted an invitation to play in the Third Lessing J. Rosenwald Trophy Tournament in New York City (1956), a premier tournament limited to the 12 players considered the best in the US.[56] Playing against top opposition, the 13-year-old Fischer could only score 4\u00bd/11, tying for 8th\u20139th place.[57] Yet he won the brilliancy prize[58] for his game against International Master Donald Byrne,[56] in which Fischer sacrificed his queen to unleash an unstoppable attack. Hans Kmoch called it \"The Game of the Century\",[59] writing: \"The following game, a stunning masterpiece of combination play performed by a boy of 13 against a formidable opponent, matches the finest on record in the history of chess prodigies.\"[60][61] According to Frank Brady, \"'The Game of the Century' has been talked about, analyzed, and admired for more than fifty years, and it will probably be a part of the canon of chess for many years to come.\"[62] \"In reflecting on his game a while after it occurred, Bobby was refreshingly modest: 'I just made the moves I thought were best. I was just lucky.'\"[63]\nIn 1957, Fischer played a two-game match against former world champion Max Euwe at New York, losing \u00bd\u20131\u00bd.[64][65][66] When the US Chess Federation published its rating list in May, Fischer had the rank of Master, the youngest player to earn that title up to that point.[65] In July, he successfully defended his US Junior title, scoring 8\u00bd/9 at San Francisco.[67] In August, he scored 10/12 at the US Open Chess Championship in Cleveland, winning on tie-breaking points over Arthur Bisguier.[68][69] This made Fischer the youngest ever US Open Champion.[70][71] He won the New Jersey Open Championship, scoring 6\u00bd/7.[72] He then defeated the young Filipino master Rodolfo Tan Cardoso 6\u20132 in a New York match sponsored by Pepsi-Cola.[73][74]\nBased on Fischer's rating and strong results, the USCF invited him to play in the 1957/58 US Championship.[75] The tournament included six-time US champion Samuel Reshevsky, defending US champion Arthur Bisguier, and William Lombardy, who in August had won the World Junior Championship.[76] Bisguier predicted that Fischer would \"finish slightly over the center mark\".[76][77] Despite all the predictions to the contrary, Fischer scored eight wins and five draws to win the tournament by a one-point margin, with 10\u00bd/13.[78][79] Still two months shy of his 15th birthday, Fischer became the youngest ever US Champion.[80] Since the championship that year was also the US Zonal Championship, Fischer's victory earned him the title of International Master.[81][82] Fischer's victory in the US Championship qualified him to participate in the 1958 Portoro\u017e Interzonal, the next step toward challenging the World Champion.[73]\nIn 1957, Fischer wanted to go to Moscow. At his pleading, \"Regina wrote directly to the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, requesting an invitation for Fischer to participate in the 6th World Youth and Student Festival of 1957. The reply\u2014affirmative\u2014came too late for him to go.\"[83] Regina did not have the money to pay the airfare, but in 1958, Fischer was invited onto the game show I've Got a Secret, where, thanks to Regina's efforts, the producers of the show arranged two round-trip tickets to the Soviet Union, for Bobby and his sister Joan.[84][85]\nOnce in Russia, Fischer was invited by the Soviet Union to Moscow,[86] where International Master Lev Abramov would serve as a guide to Bobby and his sister, Joan.[87] Upon arrival, Fischer immediately demanded that he be taken to the Moscow Central Chess Club,[88] where he played speed chess with \"two young Soviet masters\", Evgeni Vasiukov and Alexander Nikitin,[89] winning every game.[88] Chess author V. I. Linder writes about the impression Fischer gave grandmaster (GM) Vladimir Alatortsev when he played blitz against the Soviet masters:\nBack in 1958, in the Central Chess Club, Vladimir Alatortsev saw a tall, angular 15-year-old youth, who in blitz games, crushed almost everyone who crossed his path\u2026 Alatortsev was no exception, losing all three games. He was astonished by the young American Robert Fischer's play, his fantastic self-confidence, amazing chess erudition, and simply brilliant play! Vladimir said in admiration to his wife on arriving home: \"This is the future world champion!\"[90]\nFischer demanded to play against Mikhail Botvinnik, the reigning World Champion. When told that this was impossible, Fischer asked to play Paul Keres. \"Finally, Tigran Petrosian was, on a semi-official basis, summoned to the club\u00a0\u2026\" where he played speed games with Fischer, winning the majority.[91] \"When Bobby discovered that he wasn't going to play any formal games \u2026 he went into a not-so-silent rage\",[92] saying he was fed up \"with these Russian pigs,\"[93] which angered the Soviets who saw Fischer as their honored guest. It was then that the Yugoslavian chess officials offered to take in Fischer and Joan as early guests to the Interzonal. Fischer took them up on the offer, arriving in Yugoslavia to play two short training matches against masters Dragoljub Jano\u0161evi\u0107 and Milan Matulovi\u0107.[94] Fischer drew both games against Jano\u0161evi\u0107 and then defeated Matulovi\u0107 in Belgrade by 2\u00bd\u20131\u00bd.[95]\nAt Portoro\u017e, Fischer was accompanied by Lombardy.[96][97] The top six finishers in the Interzonal would qualify for the Candidates Tournament.[98] Most observers doubted that a 15-year-old with no international experience could finish among the six qualifiers at the Interzonal, but Fischer told journalist Miro Radoicic, \"I can draw with the grandmasters, and there are half-a-dozen patzers in the tournament I reckon to beat.\"[99][a] Despite some bumps in the road and a problematic start, Fischer succeeded in his plan: after a strong finish, he ended up with 12/20 (+6\u22122=12) to tie for 5th\u20136th.[101] The Soviet GM Yuri Averbakh observed,\nIn the struggle at the board this youth, almost still a child, showed himself to be a full-fledged fighter, demonstrating amazing composure, precise calculation and devilish resourcefulness. I was especially struck not even by his extensive opening knowledge, but his striving everywhere to seek new paths. In Fischer's play an enormous talent was noticeable, and in addition one sensed an enormous amount of work on the study of chess.[102]\nSoviet GM David Bronstein said of Fischer's time in Portoro\u017e: \"It was interesting for me to observe Fischer, but for a long time I couldn't understand why this 15-year-old boy played chess so well.\"[103] Fischer became the youngest person ever to qualify for the Candidates and the youngest ever grandmaster at 15 years, 6 months, 1 day.[b] \"By then everyone knew we had a genius on our hands.\"[105]\nBefore the Candidates' Tournament, Fischer won the 1958/59 US Championship (scoring 8\u00bd/11).[106] He tied for third (with Borislav Ivkov) in Mar del Plata (scoring 10/14), a half-point behind Lud\u011bk Pachman and Miguel Najdorf.[107] He tied for 4th\u20136th at Santiago (scoring 7\u00bd/12) behind Ivkov, Pachman, and Herman Pilnik.[108][109] At the Z\u00fcrich International Tournament, spring 1959, Fischer finished a point behind future world champion Mikhail Tal and a half-point behind Yugoslavian GM Svetozar Gligori\u0107.[110][111][112]\nAlthough Fischer had ended his formal education at age 16, dropping out of Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, he subsequently taught himself several foreign languages so he could read foreign chess periodicals.[113] According to Latvian chess master Alexander Koblencs, even he and Tal could not match the commitment that Fischer had made to chess. Recalling a conversation from the tournament:\n\"Tell me, Bobby,\" Tal continued, \"what do you think of the playing style of Larissa Volpert?\" \"She's too cautious. But you have another girl, Dmitrieva. Her games do appeal to me!\" Here we were left literally open-mouthed in astonishment. Misha and I have looked at thousands of games, but it never occurred to us to study our women players' games. How could we find the time for this?! Yet Bobby, it turns out, had found the time![114]\nUntil late 1959, Fischer \"had dressed atrociously for a champion, appearing at the most august and distinguished national and international events in sweaters and corduroys.\"[115] Now, encouraged by Pal Benko to dress more smartly, Fischer \"began buying suits from all over the world, hand-tailored and made to order.\"[116][117] He told journalist Ralph Ginzburg that he had 17 hand-tailored suits and that all of his shirts and shoes were handmade.[118]\nAt the age of 16, Fischer finished equal fifth out of eight at the 1959 Candidates Tournament in Bled/Zagreb/Belgrade, Yugoslavia,[119] scoring 12\u00bd/28. He was outclassed by tournament winner Tal, who won all four of their individual games.[120] That year, Fischer released his first book of collected games: Bobby Fischer's Games of Chess, published by Simon & Schuster.[121]\nFischer's interest in chess became more important than schoolwork, to the point that \"by the time he reached the fourth grade, he'd been in and out of six schools.\"[122] In 1952, Regina got Bobby a scholarship (based on his chess talent and \"astronomically high IQ\") to Brooklyn Community Woodward.[123] Fischer later attended Erasmus Hall High School at the same time as Barbra Streisand and Neil Diamond.[124][125] In 1959, its student council awarded him a gold medal for his chess achievements.[126][127] The same year, Fischer dropped out of high school when he turned 16, the earliest he could legally do so.[128][129] He later explained to Ralph Ginzburg, \"You don't learn anything in school.\"[130][131]\nWhen Fischer was 16, his mother moved out of their apartment to pursue medical training. Her friend Joan Rodker, who had met Regina when the two were \"idealistic communists\" living in Moscow in the 1930s, believes that Fischer resented his mother for being mostly absent, a communist activist, and an admirer of the Soviet Union, and that this led to his hatred for the Soviets. In letters to Rodker, Fischer's mother stated her desire to pursue her own \"obsession\" of training in medicine and wrote that her son would have to live in their Brooklyn apartment without her: \"It sounds terrible to leave a 16-year-old to his own devices, but he is probably happier that way\".[4] The apartment was on the edge of Bedford-Stuyvesant, a neighborhood that had one of the highest homicide and general crime rates in New York City.[132] Despite the alienation from her son, Regina, in 1960, protested the practices of the American Chess Foundation[133] and staged a five-hour protest in front of the White House, urging President Dwight D. Eisenhower to send an American team to that year's chess Olympiad (set for Leipzig, East Germany, behind the Iron Curtain) and to help support the team financially.[16]\nFischer played in eight US Championships, winning all of them,[134][135] by at least a one-point margin.[136] His results were:[134][137][138]\nFischer missed the 1961/62 Championship (he was preparing for the 1962 Interzonal), and there was no 1964/65 event.[148] In his eight US Chess Championships, Fischer lost only three games; to Edmar Mednis in the 1962/63 event, and in consecutive rounds to Samuel Reshevsky, and Robert Byrne in the 1965 championship, culminating in a total score of 74/90 (61 wins, 26 draws, 3 losses).[149]\nFischer refused to play in the 1958 Munich Olympiad when his demand to play first board ahead of Samuel Reshevsky was rejected.[150] Some sources claim that 15-year-old Fischer was unable to arrange leave from attending high school.[151] Fischer later represented the United States on first board at four Men's Chess Olympiads, winning two individual Silver and one individual Bronze medals:[152]\nOut of four Men's Chess Olympiads, Fischer scored +40\u22127=18, for 49/65: 75.4%.[158][159] In 1966, Fischer narrowly missed the individual gold medal, scoring 88.23% to World Champion Tigran Petrosian's 88.46%. He played four games more than Petrosian, faced stiffer opposition,[160] and would have won the gold if he had accepted Florin Gheorghiu's draw offer, rather than declining it and suffering his only loss.[161]\nAt the 1962 Varna Olympiad, Fischer predicted that he would defeat Argentinian GM Miguel Najdorf in 25 moves. Fischer actually did it in 24, becoming the only player to beat Najdorf in the tournament.[162] Najdorf lost the game while employing the very opening variation named after him: the Sicilian Najdorf.[163]\nFischer had planned to play for the US at the 1968 Lugano Olympiad, but backed out when he saw the poor playing conditions.[164] Both former world champion Tigran Petrosian and Belgian-American International Master George Koltanowski, the leader of the American team that year, felt that Fischer was justified in not participating in the Olympiad.[165] According to Lombardy, Fischer's non-participation was due to Reshevsky's refusal to yield first board.[166]\nIn 1974, Fischer was willing to play the 21st Chess Olympiad in Nice, France, but FIDE rejected his demand to play in a separate room with only Fischer, his opponent, and spectators.[167]\nIn 1960, Fischer tied for first place with Soviet star Boris Spassky at the strong Mar del Plata Tournament in Argentina, winning by a two-point margin, scoring 13\u00bd/15 (+13\u22121=1),[168][169] ahead of David Bronstein.[170] Fischer lost only to Spassky; this was the start of their lifelong friendship and rivalry.[171]\nFischer experienced a rare failure in his competitive career[172] at the Buenos Aires Tournament (1960), finishing with 8\u00bd/19 (+3\u22125=11), far behind winners Viktor Korchnoi and Samuel Reshevsky with 13/19.[173] According to Larry Evans, Fischer's first sexual experience was with a girl to whom Evans introduced him during the tournament.[174][175] Pal Benko said that Fischer did horribly in the tournament \"because he got caught up in women and sex. Afterwards, Fischer said he'd never mix women and chess together, and kept the promise.\"[176] Fischer concluded 1960 by winning a small tournament in Reykjav\u00edk with 4\u00bd/5,[177] and defeating Klaus Darga in an exhibition game in West Berlin.[178]\nIn 1961, Fischer started a 16-game match with Reshevsky, split between New York and Los Angeles.[179] Reshevsky, 32 years Fischer's senior, was considered the favorite since he had far more match experience and had never lost a set match. After 11 games and a tie score (two wins apiece with seven draws), the match ended prematurely due to a scheduling dispute between Fischer and match organizer and sponsor Jacqueline Piatigorsky. Fischer forfeited 2 games, and even though the score was now 7\u00bd to 5\u00bd, with 8\u00bd required to win, Reshevsky was declared the winner, by default, and received the winner's share of the prize fund.[180]\nFischer was second in a super-class field, behind only former world champion Tal, at Bled, 1961.[181] Yet, Fischer defeated Tal head-to-head for the first time in their individual game, scored 3\u00bd/4 against the Soviet contingent, and finished as the only unbeaten player, with 13\u00bd/19 (+8\u22120=11).[182][183]\nFischer won the 1962 Stockholm Interzonal by a 2\u00bd-point margin,[184] going undefeated, with 17\u00bd/22 (+13\u22120=9).[185][186] He was the first non-Soviet player to win an Interzonal since FIDE instituted the tournament in 1948.[187] Russian GM Alexander Kotov said of Fischer:[188]\nI have discussed Fischer's play with Max Euwe and Gideon Stahlberg. All of us, experienced 'tournament old-timers', were surprised by Fischer's endgame expertise. When a young player is good at attacking or at combinations, this is understandable, but a faultless endgame technique at the age of 19 is something rare. I can recall only one other player who at that age was equally skillful at endgames \u2013 Vasily Smyslov.\nFischer's victory made him a favorite for the Candidates Tournament in Cura\u00e7ao.[189][190] Yet, despite his result in the Interzonal, Fischer only finished fourth out of eight with 14/27 (+8\u22127=12),[191] far behind Tigran Petrosian (17\u00bd/27), Efim Geller, and Paul Keres (both 17/27).[192] Tal fell very ill during the tournament, and had to withdraw before completion. Fischer, a friend of Tal's, was the only contestant who visited him in the hospital.[193]\nFollowing his failure in the 1962 Candidates,[c] Fischer asserted in a Sports Illustrated article,[195] that three of the five Soviet players (Tigran Petrosian, Paul Keres, and Efim Geller) had a prearranged agreement to quickly draw their games against each other in order to conserve their energy for playing against Fischer. It is generally thought that this accusation is correct.[196][197] Fischer stated that he would never again participate in a Candidates' tournament, since the format, combined with the alleged collusion, made it impossible for a non-Soviet player to win. Following Fischer's article, FIDE, in late 1962, voted to implement a radical reform of the playoff system, replacing the Candidates' tournament with a format of one-on-one knockout matches\u2014the format that Fischer would dominate in 1971.[197][198]\nFischer defeated Bent Larsen in a summer 1962 exhibition game in Copenhagen for Danish TV. Later that year, Fischer beat Bogdan \u015aliwa in a team match against Poland in Warsaw.[199]\nIn the 1962/63 US Championship, Fischer lost to Edmar Mednis in round one. It was his first loss ever in a US Championship. Bisguier was in excellent form, and Fischer caught up to him only at the end. Tied at 7\u20133, the two met in the final round. Bisguier stood well in the middlegame, but blundered, handing Fischer his fifth consecutive US championship.[200]\nInfluenced by ill will over the aborted 1961 match against Reshevsky, Fischer declined an invitation to play in the 1963 Piatigorsky Cup tournament in Los Angeles, which had a world-class field.[200] He instead played in the Western Open in Bay City, Michigan, which he won with 7\u00bd/8.[201][202] In August\u2013September 1963, Fischer won the New York State Championship at Poughkeepsie, with 7/7, his first perfect score,[203] ahead of Arthur Bisguier and James Sherwin.[204]\nIn the 1963/64 US Championship, Fischer achieved his second perfect score, this time against the top-ranked chess players in the country.[144][200] This result brought Fischer heightened fame, including a profile in Life magazine.[205] Sports Illustrated diagrammed each of the 11 games in its article, \"The Amazing Victory Streak of Bobby Fischer\".[206] Such extensive chess coverage was groundbreaking for the top American sports magazine. His 11\u20130 win in the 1963/64 Championship is the only perfect score in the history of the tournament,[207] and one of about ten perfect scores in high-level chess tournaments ever.[208][209][210] David Hooper and Kenneth Whyld called it \"the most remarkable achievement of this kind\".[208] Fischer recalls:[211] \"Motivated by my lopsided result (11\u20130!), Dr. [Hans] Kmoch congratulated [Larry] Evans (the runner up) on 'winning' the tournament\u2026 and then he congratulated me on 'winning the exhibition'.\"\nFischer's 21-move victory against Robert Byrne won the brilliancy prize for the tournament. Byrne wrote:\nThe culminating combination is of such depth that, even at the very moment at which I resigned, both grandmasters who were commenting on the play for the spectators in a separate room believed I had a won game![212]\nInternational Master Anthony Saidy recalled his last round encounter with the undefeated Fischer:[213]\nGoing into the final game I certainly did not expect to upset Fischer. I hardly knew the opening but played simply, and he went along with the scenario, opting for a N-v-B [i.e., Knight vs. Bishop] endgame with a minimal edge. In the corridor, Evans said to me, \"Good. Show him we're not all children.\"\nAt adjournment, Saidy saw a way to force a draw, yet he had already \"sealed a different, wrong move\", and lost.[213] \"Chess publications around the world wrote of the unparalleled achievement. Only Bent Larsen, always a Fischer detractor, was unimpressed: 'Fischer was playing against children.'\"[214]\nFischer, eligible as US Champion, decided against his participation in the 1964 Amsterdam Interzonal, taking himself out of the 1966 World Championship cycle,[215] even after FIDE changed the format of the eight-player Candidates Tournament from a round-robin to a series of knockout matches, which eliminated the possibility of collusion.[205] Instead, Fischer embarked on a tour of the United States and Canada from February through May, playing a simultaneous exhibition, and giving a lecture in each of more than 40 cities.[216] He had a 94% winning percentage over more than 2,000 games.[216] Fischer declined an invitation to play for the US in the 1964 Olympiad in Tel Aviv.[217]\nFischer wanted to play in the Capablanca Memorial Tournament in Havana in August and September 1965.[218] Since the State Department refused to endorse Fischer's passport as valid for visiting Cuba,[219] he proposed, and the tournament officials and players accepted, a unique arrangement: Fischer played his moves from a room at the Marshall Chess Club, which were then transmitted by teleprinter to Cuba.[220][221][222][223] Lud\u011bk Pachman observed that Fischer \"was handicapped by the longer playing session resulting from the time wasted in transmitting the moves, and that is one reason why he lost to three of his chief rivals.\"[224] The tournament was an \"ordeal\" for Fischer, who had to endure eight-hour and sometimes even twelve-hour playing sessions.[225] Despite the handicap, Fischer tied for second through fourth places, with 15/21 (+12\u22123=6),[226] behind former world champion Vasily Smyslov, whom Fischer defeated in their individual game.[224] The tournament received extensive media coverage.[227][219]\nIn December, Fischer won his seventh US Championship (1965), with the score of 8\u00bd/11 (+8\u22122=1),[228] despite losing to Robert Byrne and Reshevsky in the eighth and ninth rounds.[229][230] Fischer also reconciled with Mrs. Piatigorsky, accepting an invitation to the very strong second Piatigorsky Cup (1966) tournament in Santa Monica. Fischer began disastrously and after eight rounds was tied for last with 3/8. He then staged a strong comeback, scoring 7/8 in the next eight rounds. In the end, World Chess Championship finalist Boris Spassky edged him out by a half point, scoring 11\u00bd/18 to Fischer's 11/18 (+7\u22123=8).[231][232]\nNow aged 23, Fischer would win every match or tournament he completed for the rest of his life.[233]\nFischer won the US Championship (1966/67) for the eighth and final time, ceding only three draws (+8\u22120=3).[234][235] In March\u2013April and August\u2013September, Fischer won strong tournaments at Monte Carlo, with 7/9 (+6\u22121=2),[236] and Skopje, with 13\u00bd/17 (+12\u22122=3).[237][238] In the Philippines, Fischer played nine exhibition games against master opponents, scoring 8\u00bd/9.[239]\nFischer's win in the 1966/67 US Championship qualified him for the next World Championship cycle.[228]\nAt the 1967 Interzonal, held at Sousse, Tunisia, Fischer scored 8\u00bd points in the first 10 games, to lead the field. His observance of the Worldwide Church of God's seventh-day Sabbath was honored by the organizers but deprived Fischer of several rest days, which led to a scheduling dispute,[240] causing Fischer to forfeit two games in protest and later withdraw, eliminating himself from the 1969 World Championship cycle.[241] Communications difficulties with the highly inexperienced local organizers were also a significant factor since Fischer knew little French and the organizers had very limited English. No one in Tunisian chess had previous experience running an event of this stature.[242]\nSince Fischer had completed fewer than half of his scheduled games, all of his results were annulled, meaning players who had played Fischer had those games cancelled, and the scores nullified from the official tournament record.[198]\nIn 1968, Fischer won tournaments at Netanya, with 11\u00bd/13 (+10\u22120=3),[243] and Vinkovci, with 11/13 (+9\u22120=4),[244] by large margins.[245] Fischer then stopped playing for the next 18 months, except for a win against Anthony Saidy in a 1969 New York Metropolitan League team match.[246][247] That year, Fischer (assisted by GM Larry Evans) released his second book of collected games: My 60 Memorable Games, published by Simon & Schuster.[248] The book \"was an immediate success\".[249]\nIn 1970, Fischer began a new effort to become World Champion. His dramatic march toward the title made him a household name and made chess front-page news for a time. He won the title in 1972, but forfeited it three years later.\nThe 1969 US Championship was also a zonal qualifier, with the top three finishers advancing to the Interzonal. Fischer, however, had sat out the US Championship because of disagreements about the tournament's format and prize fund. Benko, one of the three qualifiers, agreed to give up his spot in the Interzonal to give Fischer another shot at the World Championship; Lombardy, who would have been \"next in line\" after Benko, did the same.[250][251][252][253][254][255]\nIn 1970 and 1971, Fischer \"dominated his contemporaries to an extent never seen before or since\".[256]\nBefore the Interzonal, in March and April 1970, the world's best players competed in the USSR vs. Rest of the World match in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, often referred to as \"the Match of the Century\". There was much surprise when Fischer decided to participate.[257]\nWith Evans as his second,[258] Fischer flew to Belgrade[259] with the intention of playing first board for the rest of the world.[260] Danish GM Bent Larsen, however, due to his recent tournament victories, demanded to play first board instead of Fischer, even though Fischer had the higher Elo rating.[260][261] To the surprise of everyone, Fischer agreed.[262][263] Although the USSR team eked out a 20\u00bd\u201319\u00bd victory, \"On the top four boards, the Soviets managed to win only one game out of a possible sixteen. Bobby Fischer was the high scorer for his team, with a 3\u20131 score against Petrosian (two wins and two draws).\"[264] \"Fischer left no doubt in anyone's mind that he had put his temporary break from the tournament circuit to good use. Petrosian was almost unrecognizable in the first two games, and by the time he had collected himself, although pressing his opponent, he could do no more than draw the last two games of the four-game set\".[260]\nAfter the USSR versus the Rest of the World Match, the unofficial World Championship of Lightning Chess (5-minute games) was held at Herceg Novi. \"[The Russians] figured on teaching Fischer a lesson and on bringing him down a peg or two\".[265] Petrosian and Tal were considered the favorites,[266] but Fischer overwhelmed the super-class field with 19/22 (+17\u22121=4), far ahead of Tal (14\u00bd), Korchnoi (14), Petrosian (13\u00bd), and Bronstein (13).[266][267] Fischer lost only one game (to Korchnoi, who was also the only player to achieve an even score against him in the double round robin tournament).[266][268] Fischer \"crushed such blitz kings as Tal, Petrosian and Vasily Smyslov by a clean score\".[269] Tal marveled that, \"During the entire tournament he didn't leave a single pawn en prise!\", while the other players \"blundered knights and bishops galore\".[269][270] For Lombardy, who had played many blitz games with Fischer,[271] Fischer's 4\u00bd-point margin of victory \"came as a pleasant surprise\".[272]\nIn April\u2013May 1970, Fischer won at Rovinj/Zagreb with 13/17 (+10\u22121=6), by a two-point margin, ahead of Gligori\u0107, Hort, Korchnoi, Smyslov, and Petrosian.[273][274] In July\u2013August, Fischer crushed the mostly grandmaster field at Buenos Aires, winning by a 3\u00bd-point margin, scoring 15/17 (+13\u22120=4).[275] Fischer then played first board for the US Team in the 19th Chess Olympiad in Siegen, where he won an individual Silver medal, scoring 10/13 (+8\u22121=4),[157] with his only loss being to World Champion Boris Spassky.[276] Right after the Olympiad, Fischer defeated Ulf Andersson in an exhibition game for the Swedish newspaper Expressen.[277] Fischer had taken his game to a new level.[278]\nFischer won the Interzonal (held in Palma de Mallorca in November and December 1970) with 18\u00bd/23 (+15\u22121=7),[279] far ahead of Larsen, Efim Geller, and Robert H\u00fcbner, with 15/23.[280][281] Fischer finished the tournament with seven consecutive wins.[282][283] Setting aside the Sousse Interzonal (which Fischer withdrew from while leading), Fischer's victory gave him a string of eight consecutive first prizes in tournaments.[284] Former world champion Mikhail Botvinnik was not, however, impressed by Fischer's results, stating: \"Fischer has been declared a genius. I do not agree with this\u2026 In order to rightly be declared a genius in chess, you have to defeat equal opponents by a big margin. As yet he has not done this\".[285] Despite Botvinnik's remarks, \"Fischer began a miraculous year in the history of chess\".[286]\nIn the 1971 Candidates matches, Fischer was set to play against Soviet grandmaster and concert pianist Mark Taimanov in the quarter-finals. The match began in mid-May in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.[287] Fischer was generally favored to win.[287][288] Taimanov had reason to be confident. He was backed by the firm guidance of Botvinnik, who \"had thoroughly analysed Fischer's record and put together a 'dossier' on him\", from when he was in talks to play Fischer in a match \"a couple of years earlier\".[289] After Fischer defeated Taimanov in the second game of the match, Taimanov asked Fischer how he managed to come up with the move 12. N1c3, to which Fischer replied \"that the idea was not his\u2014he had come across it in the monograph by the Soviet master Alexander Nikitin in a footnote\".[290] Taimanov said of this: \"It is staggering that I, an expert on the Sicilian, should have missed this theoretically significant idea by my compatriot, while Fischer had uncovered it in a book in a foreign language!\"[291] With the score at 4\u20130, in Fischer's favor, the fifth game adjournment was a sight to behold.[292] Schonberg explains the scene:[265]\nTaimanov came to Vancouver with two seconds, both grandmasters. Fischer was alone. He thought that the sight of Taimanov and his seconds was the funniest thing he had ever seen. There Taimanov and his seconds would sit, six hands flying, pocket sets waving in the air, while variations were being spouted all over the place. And there sat Taimanov with a confused look on his face. Just before resuming play [in the fifth game] the seconds were giving Taimanov some last-minute advice. When poor Taimanov entered the playing room and sat down to confront Fischer, his head was so full of conflicting continuations that he became rattled, left a Rook en prise and immediately resigned.\nFischer beat Taimanov by the score of 6\u20130.[293] There was little precedent for such a lopsided score in a match leading to the World Championship.[294]\nUpon losing the final game of the match, Taimanov shrugged his shoulders, saying sadly to Fischer: \"Well, I still have my music.\"[295] As a result of his performance, Taimanov \"was thrown out of the USSR team and forbidden to travel for two years. He was banned from writing articles, was deprived of his monthly stipend\u2026 [and] the authorities prohibited him from performing on the concert platform.\"[296] \"The crushing loss virtually ended Taimanov's chess career.\"[297]\nFischer was next scheduled to play against Danish GM Bent Larsen. \"Spassky predicted a tight struggle. 'Larsen is a little stronger in spirit.'\"[298] Before the match, Botvinnik had told a Soviet television audience:[299]\nIt is hard to say how their match will end, but it is clear that such an easy victory as in Vancouver [against Taimanov] will not be given to Fischer. I think Larsen has unpleasant surprises in store for [Fischer], all the more since having dealt with Taimanov thus, Fischer will want to do just the same to Larsen and this is impossible.\nFischer beat Larsen by the identical score of 6\u20130.[300] Robert Byrne writes: \"To a certain extent I could grasp the Taimanov match as a kind of curiosity\u2014almost a freak, a strange chess occurrence that would never occur again. But now I am at a loss for anything whatever to say\u2026 So, it is out of the question for me to explain how Bobby, how anyone, could win six games in a row from such a genius of the game as Bent Larsen\".[301] Just a year before, Larsen had played first board for the Rest of the World team ahead of Fischer, and had handed Fischer his only loss at the Interzonal. Garry Kasparov later wrote that no player had ever shown a superiority over his rivals comparable to Fischer's \"incredible\" 12\u20130 score in the two matches.[302] Chess statistician Jeff Sonas concludes that the victory over Larsen gave Fischer the \"highest single-match performance rating ever\".[303]\nOn August 8, 1971, while preparing for his last Candidates match with former world champion Tigran Petrosian, Fischer won the Manhattan Chess Club Rapid Tournament, scoring 21\u00bd/22 against a strong field.[267][304]\nDespite Fischer's results against Taimanov and Larsen, his upcoming match against Petrosian seemed a daunting task.[305] Nevertheless, the Soviet government was concerned about Fischer.[306][307] \"Reporters asked Petrosian whether the match would last the full twelve games\u2026 'It might be possible that I win it earlier,' Petrosian replied\",[308] and then stated: \"Fischer's [nineteen consecutive] wins do not impress me. He is a great chess player but no genius.\"[309] Petrosian played a strong theoretical novelty in the first game, gaining the advantage, but Fischer eventually won the game after Petrosian faltered.[310][311][312] This gave Fischer a run of 20 consecutive wins against the world's top players (in the Interzonal and Candidates matches), a winning streak topped only by Steinitz's 25 straight wins in 1873\u20131882.[313][209] Petrosian won the second game, finally snapping Fischer's streak.[314][d] After three consecutive draws, Fischer swept the next four games to win the match 6\u00bd\u20132\u00bd (+5\u22121=3).[316] Sports Illustrated ran an article on the match, highlighting Fischer's domination of Petrosian as being due to Petrosian's outdated system of preparation:[317]\nFischer's recent record raises the distinct possibility that he has made a breakthrough in modern chess theory. His response to Petrosian's elaborately plotted 11th move in the first game is an example: Russian experts had worked on the variation for weeks, yet when it was thrown at Fischer suddenly, he faced its consequences alone and won by applying simple, classic principles.\nUpon completion of the match, Petrosian remarked: \"After the sixth game Fischer really did become a genius. I on the other hand, either had a breakdown or was tired, or something else happened, but the last three games were no longer chess.\"[318][319] \"Some experts kept insisting that Petrosian was off form, and that he should have had a plus score at the end of the sixth game\u00a0\u2026\" to which Fischer replied, \"People have been playing against me below strength for fifteen years.\"[320] Fischer's match results befuddled Botvinnik: \"It is hard to talk about Fischer's matches. Since the time that he has been playing them, miracles have begun.\"[321] \"When Petrosian played like Petrosian, Fischer played like a very strong grandmaster, but when Petrosian began making mistakes, Fischer was transformed into a genius.\"[321]\nFischer gained a far higher rating than any player in history up to that time.[322] On the July 1972 FIDE rating list, his Elo rating of 2785 was 125 points above (World No. 2) Spassky's rating of 2660.[323][324][325][326] His results put him on the cover of Life magazine,[327] and allowed him to challenge World Champion Boris Spassky, whom he had never beaten (+0\u22123=2).[328][329]\nFischer's career-long stubbornness about match and tournament conditions was again seen in the run-up to his match with Spassky. Of the possible sites, Fischer's first choice was Belgrade, Yugoslavia, while Spassky's was Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland.[330] For a time it appeared that the dispute would be resolved by splitting the match between the two locations, but that arrangement failed.[331] After that issue was resolved, Fischer refused to appear in Iceland until the prize fund was increased. London financier Jim Slater donated an additional US$125,000, bringing the prize fund up to an unprecedented $250,000 ($1.62 million today) and Fischer finally agreed to play.[332]\nBefore and during the match, Fischer paid special attention to his physical training and fitness, which was a relatively novel approach for top chess players at that time. Leading up to this match he conducted interviews with 60 Minutes and Dick Cavett explaining the importance of physical fitness in his preparation. He had developed his tennis skills to a good level, and played frequently during off-days in Reykjav\u00edk. He had also arranged for exclusive use of his hotel's swimming pool during specified hours, and swam for extended periods, usually late at night.[333] According to Soviet Grandmaster Nikolai Krogius, Fischer \"was paying great attention to sport, and that he was swimming and even boxing\u00a0\u2026\"[334]\nThe match took place in Reykjav\u00edk from July to September 1972. Fischer was accompanied by William Lombardy; besides assisting with analysis,[335] Lombardy may have played an important role in getting Fischer to play in the match and to stay in it.[336] The match was the first to receive an American broadcast in prime time.[337][338] Fischer lost the first two games in strange fashion: the first when he played a risky pawn-grab in a drawn endgame, the second by forfeit when he refused to play the game in a dispute over playing conditions.[339] Fischer would likely have forfeited the entire match, but Spassky, not wanting to win by default, yielded to Fischer's demands to move the next game to a back room, away from the cameras, whose presence had upset Fischer.[340][341] After that game, the match was moved back to the stage and proceeded without further serious incident. Fischer won seven of the next 19 games, losing only one and drawing eleven, to win the match 12\u00bd\u20138\u00bd and become the 11th World Chess Champion.[337]\nThe Cold War trappings made the match a media sensation.[342] It was called \"The Match of the Century\",[343][344][e] and received front-page media coverage in the United States and around the world.[345][346] Fischer's win was an American victory in a field that Soviet players \u2013 closely identified with and subsidized by the state \u2013 had dominated for the previous quarter-century. Kasparov remarked, \"Fischer fits ideologically into the context of the Cold War era: a lone American genius challenges the Soviet chess machine and defeats it\".[347][348] Dutch Grandmaster Jan Timman calls Fischer's victory \"the story of a lonely hero who overcomes an entire empire\".[349] Fischer's sister observed, \"Bobby did all this in a country almost totally without a chess culture. It was as if an Eskimo had cleared a tennis court in the snow and gone on to win the world championship\".[350]\nUpon Fischer's return to New York,[351] a Bobby Fischer Day was held.[352] He was offered numerous product endorsement offers worth \"at least $5 million\" ($32.4 million today), all of which he declined.[353] He appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated[354] with American Olympic swimming champion Mark Spitz and also appeared on The Dick Cavett Show, as well as on a Bob Hope TV special.[355] Membership in the US Chess Federation doubled in 1972,[356] and peaked in 1974; in American chess, these years are commonly referred to as the \"Fischer Boom\". This match attracted more worldwide interest than any chess championship before or since.[357]\nFischer was scheduled to defend his title in 1975 against Anatoly Karpov, who had emerged as his challenger.[358] Fischer, who had played no competitive games since his World Championship match with Spassky, laid out a proposal for the match in September 1973, in consultation with FIDE official Fred Cramer. He made three principal (non-negotiable) demands:\nA FIDE Congress was held in 1974 during the Nice Olympiad. The delegates voted in favor of Fischer's 10-win proposal, but rejected his other two proposals, and limited the number of games in the match to 36.[360] In response to FIDE's ruling, Fischer sent a cable to Euwe on June 27, 1974:[361][362][363]\nAs I made clear in my telegram to the FIDE delegates, the match conditions I proposed were non-negotiable. Mr. Cramer informs me that the rules of the winner being the first player to win ten games, draws not counting, unlimited number of games and if nine wins to nine match is drawn with champion regaining title and prize fund split equally were rejected by the FIDE delegates. By so doing FIDE has decided against my participation in the 1975 World Chess Championship. Therefore, I resign my FIDE World Chess Championship title. Sincerely, Bobby Fischer.\nThe delegates responded by reaffirming their prior decisions, but did not accept Fischer's resignation and requested that he reconsider.[364] Many observers considered Fischer's requested 9\u20139 clause unfair because it would require the challenger to win by at least two games (10\u20138).[365] Botvinnik called the 9\u20139 clause \"unsporting\".[366] Korchnoi, David Bronstein, and Lev Alburt considered the 9\u20139 clause reasonable.[367][368][369]\nDue to the continued efforts of US Chess Federation officials,[370] a special FIDE Congress was held in March 1975 in Bergen, Netherlands,[371] in which it was accepted that the match should be of unlimited duration, but the 9\u20139 clause was once again rejected, by a narrow margin of 35 votes to 32.[372] FIDE set a deadline of April 1, 1975, for Fischer and Karpov to confirm their participation in the match. No reply was received from Fischer by April 3. Thus, by default, Karpov officially became World Champion.[373] In his 1991 autobiography, Karpov professed regret that the match had not taken place, and claimed that the lost opportunity to challenge Fischer held back his own chess development. Karpov met with Fischer several times after 1975, in friendly but ultimately unsuccessful attempts to arrange a match, since Karpov would never agree to play to 10.[374]\nBrian Carney opined in The Wall Street Journal that Fischer's victory over Spassky in 1972 left him nothing to prove, except that perhaps someone could someday beat him, and he was not interested in the risk of losing. He also opined that Fischer's refusal to recognize peers also allowed his paranoia to flower: \"The world championship he won\u00a0... validated his view of himself as a chess player, but it also insulated him from the humanizing influences of the world around him. He descended into what can only be considered a kind of madness\".[197]\nBronstein felt that Fischer \"had the right to play the match with Karpov on his own conditions\".[375] Korchnoi stated:[376]\nWas Fischer right in demanding that the world title be protected by a two point handicap \u2013 that the challenger would be considered the winner with a 10\u20138 score and that the champion would retain his title in the event of a 9\u20139 draw? Yes, this was quite natural: the champion deserves this, not to mention the fact that further play to the first win in the event of an even score would be nothing short of a lottery \u2013 the winner in that case could not claim to have won a convincing victory.\nSoviet GM Lev Alburt felt that the decision to not concede to Fischer's demands rested on Karpov's \"sober view of what he was capable of\".[377] Years later, in his 1992 match against Spassky, Fischer said that Karpov refused to play against him under Fischer's conditions.[378]\nAfter the 1972 World Chess Championship, Fischer did not play a competitive game in public for nearly 20\u00a0years.[379] In 1977 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, he played three games against the MIT Greenblatt computer program, winning them all.[380]\nHe moved to the Los Angeles area and associated with the Worldwide Church of God for a time.[381] On May 26, 1981, while walking in Pasadena, Fischer was arrested by a police patrolman, because he resembled a man who had just committed a robbery in the area.[382] Fischer, who alleged that he was slightly injured during the arrest,[383] said that he was held for two days, subjected to assault and various types of mistreatment,[384] and released on $1,000 bail.[385] Fischer published a 14-page pamphlet detailing his allegations of police misconduct, saying that his arrest had been \"a frame up and set up\".[386][387][388]\nIn 1981, Fischer stayed at the home of grandmaster Peter Biyiasas in San Francisco, where, over a period of four months, he defeated Biyiasas seventeen times in a series of speed games.[389][390] In an interview with Sports Illustrated reporter William Nack, Biyiasas assessed Fischer's play:[388][391]\nHe was too good. There was no use in playing him. It wasn't interesting. I was getting beaten, and it wasn't clear to me why. It wasn't like I made this mistake or that mistake. It was like I was being gradually outplayed, from the start. He wasn't taking any time to think. The most depressing thing about it is that I wasn't even getting out of the middle game to an endgame. I don't ever remember an endgame. He honestly believes there is no one for him to play, no one worthy of him. I played him, and I can attest to that.\nIn 1988\u20131990, Fischer had a relationship with German chess player Petra Stadler, who had been put in touch with Fischer by Spassky. When Stadler later published a book about the affair,[392] Spassky apologized to Fischer.[393]\nFischer emerged after twenty years of isolation to play Spassky (then tied for 96th\u2013102nd on the FIDE rating list) in a \"Revenge Match of the 20th century\" in 1992. This match took place in Sveti Stefan and Belgrade, Yugoslavia, in spite of a United Nations embargo that included sanctions on commercial activities. Fischer demanded that the organizers bill the match as \"The World Chess Championship\", although Garry Kasparov was the recognized FIDE World Champion. Fischer insisted he was still the true World Champion, and that for all the games in the FIDE-sanctioned World Championship matches, involving Karpov, Korchnoi, and Kasparov, the outcomes had been prearranged.[394] The purse for the rematch was US$5\u00a0million, with $3.35\u00a0million of the purse to go to the winner.[395][396] This was and still is the largest purse for a match in chess history.\nAccording to grandmaster Andrew Soltis:[397]\n[The match games] were of a fairly high quality, particularly when compared with Kasparov's championship matches of 1993, 1995 and 2000, for example. Yet the games also reminded many fans of how out of place Fischer was in 1992. He was still playing the openings of a previous generation. He was, moreover, the only strong player in the world who didn't trust computers and wasn't surrounded by seconds and supplicants.\nFischer won the match with 10 wins, 5 losses, and 15 draws.[398] Kasparov stated, \"Bobby is playing OK, nothing more. Maybe his strength is 2600 or 2650. It wouldn't be close between us\".[399] Yasser Seirawan believed that the match proved that Fischer's playing strength was \"somewhere in the top ten in the world\".[400]\nFischer and Spassky gave ten press conferences during the match.[401] Seirawan attended the match and met with Fischer on several occasions; the two analyzed some match games and had personal discourse. Seirawan later wrote: \"After September 23 [1992], I threw most of what I'd ever read about Bobby out of my head. Sheer garbage. Bobby is the most misunderstood, misquoted celebrity walking the face of the earth.\"[402] He added that Fischer was not camera shy, smiled and laughed easily, was \"a fine wit\" and \"wholly enjoyable conversationalist\".[403]\nThe US Department of the Treasury warned Fischer before the start of the match that his participation was illegal, that it would violate President George H. W. Bush's Executive Order 12810 imposing United Nations Security Council Resolution 757 sanctions against engaging in economic activities in Yugoslavia.[404] In response, during the first scheduled press conference on September 1, 1992, in front of the international press, Fischer spat on the US order, saying \"this is my reply\".[405] His violation of the order led US Federal officials to initiate a warrant for his arrest upon completion of the match,[406] citing, in pertinent part, \"Title 50 USC \u00a7\u00a71701, 1702, and 1705 and Executive Order 12810\".[407][408]\nBefore the rematch against Spassky, Fischer had won a training match against Svetozar Gligori\u0107 in Sveti Stefan with six wins, one loss, and three draws.[409]\nAfter the 1992 match with Spassky, Fischer, now a fugitive, slid back into relative obscurity, taking up residence in Budapest, Hungary, and allegedly having a relationship with young Hungarian chess master Zita Rajcs\u00e1nyi.[388][410] Fischer stated that standard chess was stale and that he now played blitz games of chess variants, such as Chess960. He visited the Polg\u00e1r family in Budapest and analyzed many games with Judit, Zsuzsa, and Zs\u00f3fia Polg\u00e1r.[411][412][413] In 1998 and 1999, he also stayed at the house of young Hungarian grandmaster Peter Leko.[414]\nFrom 2000 to 2002, Fischer lived in Baguio in the Philippines, residing in the same compound as the Filipino grandmaster Eugenio Torre, a close friend who had acted as his second during his 1992 match with Spassky.[415] Torre introduced Fischer to a 22\u00a0year-old woman named Marilyn Young.[f] On May 21, 2001, Marilyn Young gave birth to a daughter named Jinky Young, and claimed that Fischer was the child's father,[417][418] a claim ultimately disproven by DNA after Fischer's death.[419][420]\nShortly after midnight on September 12, 2001, Philippines local time (approximately four hours after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the US), Fischer was interviewed live by Pablo Mercado on the Baguio station of the Bombo Radyo network. Fischer stated that he was happy that the attacks had happened, while expressing his view on United States and Israeli foreign policy, saying, \"I applaud the act. Look, nobody gets\u00a0... that the US and Israel have been slaughtering the Palestinians\u00a0... for years.\"[421][422][423][424] He also said, \"The horrible behavior that the US is committing all over the world\u00a0... This just shows you, that what goes around, comes around, even for the United States.\"[421][422] Fischer also referenced the movie Seven Days in May and said he hoped for a military coup d'\u00e9tat in the US: \"[I hope] the country will be taken over by the military\u2014they'll close down all the synagogues, arrest all the Jews, execute hundreds of thousands of Jewish ringleaders.\"[425][426] In response to Fischer's statements about 9/11, the US Chess Federation passed a motion to cancel his right to membership in the organization.[427] Fischer's right to become a member was reinstated in 2007.[428]\nFischer lived for a time in Japan. On July 13, 2004, acting in response to a letter from US officials, Japanese immigration authorities arrested him at Narita International Airport near Tokyo for allegedly using a revoked US passport while trying to board a Japan Airlines flight to Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila, Philippines.[429][430][431] Fischer resisted arrest, and claimed to have sustained bruises, cuts and a broken tooth in the process.[432] At the time, Fischer had a passport (originally issued in 1997 and updated in 2003 to add more pages) that, according to US officials, had been revoked in November 2003 due to his outstanding arrest-warrant for the Yugoslavia sanctions violation.[429] Despite the outstanding arrest-warrant in the US, Fischer said that he believed the passport was still valid.[433] The authorities held Fischer at a custody center for 16 days before transferring him to another facility. Fischer said that his cell was windowless and he had not seen the light of day during that period, and that the staff had ignored his complaints about constant tobacco smoke in his cell.[432][434][435]\nTokyo-based Canadian journalist and consultant John Bosnitch set up the \"Committee to Free Bobby Fischer\" after meeting Fischer at Narita Airport and offering to assist him.[436] Boris Spassky wrote a letter to US President George W. Bush, asking \"For mercy, charity,\" and, if that was not possible, \"to put [him] in the same cell with Bobby Fischer\" and \"to give [them] a chess set\".[437] It was reported that Fischer and Miyoko Watai, the President of the Japanese Chess Association (with whom he had reportedly been living since 2000) wanted to become legally married.[429] It was also reported that Fischer had been living in the Philippines with Marilyn Young during the same period.[415] Fischer applied for German citizenship, on the grounds that his father was German.[438] Fischer stated that he wanted to renounce his US citizenship, and appealed to US Secretary of State Colin Powell to help him do so, though to no effect.[439][440] Japan's Justice Minister rejected Fischer's request for asylum and ordered his deportation.[441][442][443]\nWhile in prison, Bobby Fischer legally married Miyoko Watai on September 6, 2004.[444]\nSeeking ways to evade deportation to the United States, Fischer wrote a letter to the government of Iceland in early January 2005, requesting Icelandic citizenship.[445] Sympathetic to Fischer's plight, but reluctant to grant him the full benefits of citizenship, Icelandic authorities granted him an alien's passport. When this proved insufficient for the Japanese authorities, the Althing (the Icelandic Parliament), at the behest of William Lombardy,[446][447] agreed unanimously to grant Fischer full citizenship in late March for humanitarian reasons, as they felt he was being unjustly treated by the United States and Japanese governments,[448][449] and also in recognition of his 1972 match, which had \"put Iceland on the map\".[450]\nAfter arriving in Reykjav\u00edk in late March, Fischer gave a press conference.[451][452] He lived a reclusive life in Iceland, avoiding entrepreneurs and others who approached him with various proposals.[453]\nFischer moved into an apartment in the same building as his close friend and spokesman, Gar\u00f0ar Sverrisson.[454] Gar\u00f0ar's wife, Krist\u00edn \u00de\u00f3rarinsd\u00f3ttir, was a nurse and later looked after Fischer as a terminally ill patient. Gar\u00f0ar's two children, especially his son, were very close to Fischer.[455] Fischer also developed a friendship with Magn\u00fas Sk\u00falason, a psychiatrist and chess player who later recalled long discussions with him on a wide variety of subjects.[456]\nOn December 10, 2006, Fischer telephoned an Icelandic television station that had just broadcast a chess game in which one player blundered such that his opponent was able to mate on the next move. Although he tried to change his mind upon seeing the mate, the touch-move rule forced him to play the blunder. Fischer pointed out a winning combination that could have been played instead of the blunder or the other attempted move, but had been missed by the player and commentators.[457]\nIn 2005, some of Fischer's belongings were auctioned on eBay.[458] Fischer claimed, in 2006, that the belongings sold in the US without his permission were worth \"hundreds of millions of [US] dollars; even billions of dollars.\"[459][460] In the same interview, Fischer also said that UBS Bank had closed an account of his and liquidated his assets against his wishes, transferring the funds to a bank in Iceland.[461]\nOn January 17, 2008, Fischer died at age 64 from degenerative kidney failure at the Landsp\u00edtali Hospital (National University Hospital of Iceland) in Reykjav\u00edk.[462][463] He originally had a urinary tract blockage but refused surgery or medication.[464][465][466] Magn\u00fas Sk\u00falason reported Fischer's response to leg massages: \"Nothing soothes as much as the human touch.\"[467]\nOn January 21, Fischer was buried in the small Christian cemetery of Laugard\u00e6lir church, outside the town of Selfoss, 60 kilometres (37\u00a0mi) southeast of Reykjav\u00edk, after a Catholic funeral presided over by Fr. Jakob Rolland of the diocese of Reykjav\u00edk. In accordance with Fischer's wishes, only Miyoko Watai, Gar\u00f0ar Sverrisson, and Gar\u00f0ar's family were present.[468]\nFischer's estate was estimated at 140 million ISK (about \u00a31 million, or US$2 million). It quickly became the object of a legal battle involving claims from four parties, with Miyoko Watai ultimately inheriting what remained of Fischer's estate after government claims. The four parties were Fischer's Japanese wife, Miyoko Watai; his alleged Filipino daughter, Jinky Young, and her mother, Marilyn Young; his two American nephews, Alexander and Nicholas Targ, and their father, Russell Targ; and the US government (claiming unpaid taxes).[469][456][470][471]\nMarilyn Young claimed that Jinky was Fischer's daughter, citing as evidence Jinky's birth and baptismal certificates, photographs, a transaction record dated December 4, 2007, of a bank remittance by Fischer to Jinky, and Jinky's DNA through her blood samples.[417][472][416] However, Magn\u00fas Sk\u00falason, a friend of Fischer's, said that he was certain that Fischer was not the girl's father.[469] In addition, the validity of Miyoko Watai's marriage to Fischer was challenged.[473][417]\nOn June 16, 2010, Iceland's supreme court ruled in favor of a petition on behalf of Jinky Young to have Fischer's remains exhumed.[474][475] The exhumation was performed on July 5, 2010, in the presence of a doctor, a priest, and other officials. A DNA sample was taken and Fischer's body was then reburied.[476]\nOn August 17, 2010, it was announced that results of DNA testing had ruled out Fischer as the father of Jinky Young.[419][420] On March 3, 2011, an Icelandic district court ruled that Miyoko Watai and Fischer had married on September 6, 2004,[477] and that, as Fischer's widow and heir, Watai was therefore entitled to inherit Fischer's estate.[478] Fischer's nephews were ordered to pay Watai's legal costs, amounting to ISK 6.6 million (approximately $57,000).[477]\nAlthough Fischer's mother was Jewish, Fischer rejected attempts to label him as Jewish.[13] In a 1962 interview with Harper's, asked if he was Jewish, he replied that he was \"part-Jewish\" through his mother. In the same interview he was quoted as saying: \"I read a book lately by Nietzsche and he says religion is just to dull the senses of the people. I agree.\"[479][480] In a 1984 letter to the editor of the Encyclopaedia Judaica, Fischer demanded that they remove his name from future editions.[481]\nFischer associated with the Worldwide Church of God in the mid-1960s. The church prescribed Saturday Sabbath, and forbade work (and competitive chess) on Sabbath.[482] According to his friend and colleague Larry Evans, in 1968 Fischer felt philosophically that \"the world was coming to an end\" and he might as well make some money by publishing My 60 Memorable Games;[483] Fischer thought that the Rapture was coming soon.[484]\nDuring the mid-1970s, Fischer contributed significant money to the Worldwide Church of God.[485] In 1972, one journalist stated that \"Fischer is almost as serious about religion as he is about chess\", and the champion credited his faith with greatly improving his chess.[486][487] Yet prophecies by Herbert W. Armstrong went unfulfilled.[488] Fischer eventually left the church in 1977, \"accusing it of being 'Satanic', and vigorously attacking its methods and leadership\".[389]\nTowards the end of his life, Fischer became interested in Catholicism. He bought his friend Gardar Sverrisson a copy of \"Basic Catechism: Creed, Sacraments, Morality, Prayer\" so Gardar could explain the religion better to him.[489] According to Sverrisson, Fischer talked to him about transformation of society through creation of harmony and that \"the only hope for the world is through Catholicism.\"[489] Fischer was also known to have read a synopsis of G. K. Chesterton's works in the years leading up to his death. He requested a Catholic funeral, and this final service was presided over by Catholic priest Jakob Rolland.[490][491]\nFischer made numerous antisemitic statements and professed a general hatred for Jews from at least the early 1960s.[492][493] Jan Hein Donner wrote that at the time of Bled 1961, \"He idolized Hitler and read everything about him that he could lay his hands on. He also championed a brand of antisemitism that could only be thought up by a mind completely cut off from reality.\"[172] Donner took Fischer to a war museum, which \"left a great impression, since [Fischer] is not an evil person, and afterwards he was more restrained in his remarks\u2014to me, at least.\"[172]\nFrom the 1980s on, Fischer's comments about Jews were a major theme in his public and private remarks.[494] He openly denied the Holocaust, and called the United States \"a farce controlled by dirty, hook-nosed, circumcised Jew bastards\".[495] Between 1999 and 2006, Fischer's primary means of communicating with the public was radio interviews. He participated in at least 34 such broadcasts, mostly with radio stations in the Philippines, but also in Hungary, Iceland, Colombia, and Russia. In 1999, he gave a radio call-in interview to a station in Budapest, Hungary, during which he described himself as the \"victim of an international Jewish conspiracy\". In another radio interview, Fischer said that it became clear to him in 1977, after reading The Secret World Government by Count Cherep-Spiridovich, that Jewish agencies were targeting him.[496] Fischer's sudden reemergence was apparently triggered when some of his belongings, which had been stored in a Pasadena, California, storage unit, were sold by the landlord, who claimed it was in response to nonpayment of rent.[497] Fischer was also upset that UBS had liquidated his assets and closed his account without his permission. When asked who he thought was responsible for the actions UBS had taken, Fischer replied: \"There's no question that the Jew-controlled United States is behind this\u2014that's obvious.\"[459][461] Fischer, at a press conference upon his return to Reykjavik, Iceland, lashed out at Jeremy Schaap, the son of the late Dick Schaap, a sportswriter who had been a father figure to Fischer when growing up, calling his father a \"Jewish snake\" for doubting Fischer's sanity in his later writings.[498][499]\nFischer's library contained antisemitic and racist literature such as Mein Kampf, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and The White Man's Bible and Nature's Eternal Religion by Ben Klassen, founder of the World Church of the Creator.[500][501][480] A notebook written by Fischer contains sentiments such as \"12/13/99 It's time to start randomly killing Jews\".[502] Despite his views, Fischer remained on good terms with Jewish chess players.[503]\nWhile as far as is known Fischer was never formally diagnosed with a mental disorder,[16] there has been widespread comment and speculation concerning his psychological condition based on his extreme views and unusual behavior.[504] Reuben Fine, psychologist and chess player, who met Fischer many times, said that \"Some of Bobby's behavior is so strange, unpredictable, odd and bizarre that even his most ardent apologists have had a hard time explaining what makes him tick\" and described him as \"a troubled human being\" with \"obvious personal problems\".[505]\nValery Krylov, advisor to Anatoly Karpov and a specialist in the \"psycho-physiological rehabilitation of sportsmen\", believed Fischer had schizophrenia.[504] Psychologist Joseph G. Ponterotto, from secondhand sources, concludes that \"Bobby did not meet all the necessary criteria to reach diagnoses of schizophrenia or Asperger syndrome. The evidence is stronger for paranoid personality disorder.\"[504] Magn\u00fas Sk\u00falason, a chess player, psychiatrist and head doctor of Sogn Institution for Mentally Ill Offenders near Selfoss, befriended Fischer towards the end of Fischer's life. From Endgame, Fischer's 2011 biography by Frank Brady:\nSkulason was not \"Bobby's psychiatrist\", as has been implied in the general press, nor did he offer Bobby any analysis or psychotherapy. He was at Bobby's bedside as a friend, to try to do anything he could for him. Because of his training, however, he couldn't fail to take note of Bobby's mental condition. \"He definitely was not schizophrenic\", Skulason said. \"He had problems, possibly certain childhood traumas that had affected him. He was misunderstood. Underneath I think he was a caring sensitive person.\"[467]\nFischer's opening repertoire was narrow in some ways. As White, Fischer almost exclusively played 1.e4, calling it \"best by test\",[513]  throughout his career.[514] He played 1.d4 only once in a serious game, during a blitz tournament.[515] In spite of this narrowness, he was considered by some of his rivals to be unpredictable in his opening play, and a difficult opponent to prepare for.[516]\nAs Black, Fischer would usually play the Najdorf Sicilian against 1.e4, and the King's Indian Defense against 1.d4, only rarely venturing into the Nimzo-Indian, Benoni, Gr\u00fcnfeld or Neo-Gr\u00fcnfeld.[517] Fischer acknowledged difficulty playing against the Winawer Variation of the French Defense (1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4), but maintained that the Winawer was unsound because it exposed Black's kingside, and that, in his view, \"Black was trading off his good bishop with 3...Bb4 and\u00a0...Bxc3.\"[518] Later on Fischer said: \"I may yet be forced to admit that the Winawer is sound. But I doubt it! The defense is anti-positional and weakens the K-side.\"[519]\nFischer was renowned for his opening preparation and made numerous contributions to chess opening theory.[520] He was one of the foremost experts on the Ruy Lopez.[521] A line of the Exchange Variation (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Bxc6 dxc6 5.0-0) is sometimes called the \"Fischer Variation\" after he successfully resurrected it at the 1966 Havana Olympiad.[522][523] Fischer's lifetime score with the move 5.0-0 in tournament and match games was eight wins, three draws, and no losses (86.36%).[524]\nFischer was a recognized expert in the black side of the Najdorf Sicilian and the King's Indian Defense.[525] He used the Gr\u00fcnfeld Defense and Neo-Gr\u00fcnfeld Defense to win his celebrated games against Donald and Robert Byrne, and played a theoretical novelty in the Gr\u00fcnfeld against reigning world champion Mikhail Botvinnik, refuting Botvinnik's prepared analysis over the board.[526][527] In the Nimzo-Indian Defense, the line beginning with 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e3 b6 5.Ne2 Ba6 was named after him.[528][529][530]\nFischer established the viability of the so-called Poisoned Pawn Variation of the Najdorf Sicilian (1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6 6.Bg5 e6 7.f4 Qb6). This bold queen sortie, to snatch a pawn at the expense of development, had been considered dubious,[531][532][533] but Fischer succeeded in proving its soundness.[534] Out of ten tournament and match games as Black in the Poisoned Pawn, Fischer scored 70%, winning five, drawing four, and losing only one: the 11th game of his 1972 match against Spassky.[535] Following Fischer's use, the Poisoned Pawn Variation became a respected line, utilized by many of the world's leading players.[536] Fischer's 10.f5 in this line against Efim Geller quickly became the main line of the Poisoned Pawn.\nOn the white side of the Sicilian, Fischer made advances to the theory of the line beginning 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6 (or e6) 6.Bc4,[534][537] which has sometimes been named after him.[538]\nIn 1961, prompted by a loss the year before to Spassky,[539] Fischer wrote an article titled \"A Bust to the King's Gambit\" for the first issue of the American Chess Quarterly, in which he stated, \"In my opinion, the King's Gambit is busted. It loses by force.\"[506] Fischer recommended 1.e4 e5 2.f4 exf4 3.Nf3 d6,[540] which has since become known as the Fischer Defense, as a refutation to the King's Gambit.[541][542][543] Fischer later played the King's Gambit as White in three tournament games, winning them all.[544]\nFischer had excellent endgame technique.[545] International Master Jeremy Silman listed him as one of the five best endgame players (along with Emanuel Lasker, Akiba Rubinstein, Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca, and Vasily Smyslov), calling Fischer a \"master of bishop endings\".[546] The endgame of a rook, bishop, and pawns against a rook, knight, and pawns has sometimes been called the \"Fischer Endgame\" because of several instructive wins by Fischer (with the bishop), including three against Mark Taimanov in 1970 and 1971.[547][548][549]\nIn 1988, Fischer filed for U.S. Patent 4,884,255 for a new type of chess clock, which gave each player a fixed period at the start of the game and then added a small increment after each completed move.[550]\nAn example of Fischer's patented clock was made for, and used in, the 1992 rematch between Fischer and Spassky.[551][398] Clocks based on the \"Fischer clock\" soon became standard in major chess tournaments.[552] Fischer would later complain that he was cheated out of the royalties for this invention.[553]\nFollowing his re-emergence onto the chess scene with his 1992 match against Spassky, Fischer heavily disparaged chess as it was being played at the highest levels.[554] As a result, on June 19, 1996, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Fischer announced and advocated a variant of chess called Fischerandom (later also known as Chess960). The goal of Fischerandom was to ensure that a game between two players is a contest between their understandings of chess, rather than their abilities to prepare opening strategies or memorize opening lines.[555][556]\nSome grandmasters compared Fischer's play to that of a computer[557][558] or a player without noticeable weaknesses.[559]\nBiographers David Edmonds and John Eidinow wrote:\nFaced with Fischer's extraordinary coolness, his opponents  [sic] assurance would begin to disintegrate. A Fischer move, which at first glance looked weak, would be reassessed. It must have a deep master plan behind it, undetectable by mere mortals (more often than not they were right, it did). The US grandmaster Robert Byrne labeled the phenomenon \"Fischer-fear\". Grandmasters would wilt, their suits would crumple, sweat would glisten on their brows, panic would overwhelm their nervous systems. Errors would creep in. Calculations would go awry. There was talk among grandmasters that Fischer hypnotized his opponents, that he undermined their intellectual powers with a dark, mystic, insidious force.[560]\nKasparov wrote that Fischer \"became the detonator of an avalanche of new chess ideas, a revolutionary whose revolution is still in progress\".[561] In January 2009, reigning world champion Viswanathan Anand described him as \"the greatest chess player who ever lived\".[562] Serbian GM Ljubomir Ljubojevi\u0107 called Fischer, \"A man without frontiers. He didn't divide the East and the West, he brought them together in their admiration of him.\"[453]\nGerman GM Karsten M\u00fcller wrote:\nFischer, who had taken the highest crown almost singlehandedly from the mighty, almost invincible Soviet chess empire, shook the whole world, not only the chess world, to its core. He started a chess boom not only in the United States and in the Western hemisphere, but worldwide. Teaching chess or playing chess as a career had truly become a respectable profession. After Bobby, the game was simply not the same.[563]\n(Rapid, blitz, and blindfold games not included; listed as +wins \u2212losses =draws.)[564]\nPlayers who have been World Champions in boldface\nIn 2001, Nigel Short wrote in The Sunday Telegraph chess column that he believed he had been secretly playing Fischer on the Internet Chess Club (ICC) in speed chess matches.[565][566] Subsequently others claimed to have played Fischer as well.[567]\nFischer denied ownership of the account.[568]\nFischer played 752 tournament games in his career, winning 417, drawing 251, and losing 84.[581] These include, however, games when he was very young; if only the games after he turned 20 are considered, he played 311 tournament games and lost 23, a 7.4% loss percentage.[581]\nThe 1955 US Amateur Championship was the first tournament organized by the US Chess Federation in which Fischer entered. Before this tournament, he had played in the Brooklyn Chess Club Championships, in some tournaments organized by the Brooklyn YMCA Chess and Checker Club, and in a correspondence chess tournament organized by Chess Review.", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_fischer", " https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bobby_fischer#bodyContent", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page",

Wikipedia": {"text": "Garry Kimovich Kasparov[a] (born 13 April 1963) is a Russian chess grandmaster, former World Chess Champion (1985\u20132000), political activist and writer. His peak FIDE chess rating of 2851,[3] achieved in 1999, was the highest recorded until being surpassed by Magnus Carlsen in 2013. From 1984 until his retirement from regular competitive chess in 2005, Kasparov was ranked world no. 1 for a record 255 months overall. Kasparov also holds records for the most consecutive professional tournament victories (15) and Chess Oscars (11).\nKasparov became the youngest-ever undisputed world champion in 1985 at age 22 by defeating then-champion Anatoly Karpov.[4] He defended the title against Karpov three times, in 1986, 1987 and 1990. Kasparov held the official FIDE world title until 1993, when a dispute with FIDE led him to set up a rival organisation, the Professional Chess Association.[5] In 1997, he became the first world champion to lose a match to a computer under standard time controls when he was defeated by the IBM supercomputer Deep Blue in a highly publicised match. He continued to hold the \"Classical\" world title until his defeat by Vladimir Kramnik in 2000. Despite losing the PCA title, he continued winning tournaments and was the world's highest-rated player at the time of his official retirement. Kasparov coached Carlsen in 2009\u201310, during which time Carlsen rose to world no. 1. Kasparov stood unsuccessfully for FIDE president in 2013\u20132014.\nSince retiring from chess, Kasparov has devoted his time to writing and politics. His book series My Great Predecessors, first published in 2003, details the history and games of the world champion chess players who preceded him. He formed the United Civil Front movement and was a member of The Other Russia, a coalition opposing the administration and policies of Vladimir Putin. In 2008, he announced an intention to run as a candidate in that year's Russian presidential race, but after encountering logistical problems in his campaign, for which he blamed \"official obstruction\", he withdrew.[6][7][8] In the wake of the Russian mass protests that began in 2011, he announced in June 2013 that he had left Russia for the immediate future out of fear of persecution.[9] Following his flight from Russia, he lived in New York City with his family.[10][11] In 2014, he obtained Croatian citizenship and has maintained a residence in Podstrana near Split.[12][13][14]\nKasparov is chairman of the Human Rights Foundation and chairs its International Council. In 2017, he founded the Renew Democracy Initiative (RDI), an American political organisation promoting and defending liberal democracy in the U.S. and abroad. He serves as chairman of the group. Kasparov is also a security ambassador for the software company Avast.[15]\nKasparov was born Garik Kimovich Weinstein (Russian: \u0413\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043a \u041a\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0412\u0430\u0439\u043d\u0448\u0442\u0435\u0439\u043d, Garik Kimovich Vainshtein) in Baku, Azerbaijan SSR (now Azerbaijan), Soviet Union. His father, Kim Moiseyevich Weinstein, was Jewish and his mother, Klara Shagenovna Kasparova, was Armenian.[16][17][18][19] Both of his mother's parents were Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh.[20] Kasparov has described himself as a \"self-appointed Christian\", although \"very indifferent\"[21] and identifying as Russian: \"[A]lthough I'm half-Armenian, half-Jewish, I consider myself Russian because Russian is my native tongue, and I grew up with Russian culture.\"[22][23] Kasparov and his family had to \"flee anti-Armenian pogroms in Baku in January 1990 that were coordinated by local leaders with Soviet acquiescence\".[24]\nAccording to Kasparov himself, he was named after United States President Harry Truman,[25] \"whom my father admired for taking a strong stand against communism. It was a rare name in Russia, until Harry Potter came along.\"[26]\nKasparov began the serious study of chess after he came across a problem set up by his parents and proposed a solution.[27] When he was seven years old, his father died of leukaemia.[28] At the age of twelve, Kasparov, upon the request of his mother Klara and with the consent of the family, adopted Klara's surname Kasparov, which was done to avoid possible anti-Semitic tensions common in the USSR at the time.[29]\nFrom age seven, Kasparov attended the Young Pioneer Palace in Baku and, at ten, began training at Mikhail Botvinnik's chess school under coach Vladimir Makogonov. Makogonov helped develop Kasparov's positional skills and taught him to play the Caro-Kann Defence and the Tartakower System of the Queen's Gambit Declined.[30] Kasparov won the Soviet Junior Championship in Tbilisi in 1976, scoring 7/9 points, at age thirteen. He repeated the feat the following year, winning with a score of 8.5/9. He was being coached by Alexander Shakarov during this time.[31]\nIn 1978, Kasparov participated in the Sokolsky Memorial tournament in Minsk. He had received a special invitation to enter the tournament but took first place and became a chess master. Kasparov has stressed that this event was a turning point in his life and that it convinced him to choose chess as his career: \"I will remember the Sokolsky Memorial as long as I live\", he wrote. He has also said that after the victory, he thought he had a very good shot at the world championship.[32]\nHe first qualified for the USSR Chess Championship at age 15 in 1978, the youngest-ever player at that level. He won the 64-player Swiss system tournament at Daugavpils on a tie-break over Igor V. Ivanov to capture the sole qualifying place.[33]\nKasparov rose quickly through the FIDE world rankings. Due to an oversight by the Russian Chess Federation, which believed that a grandmaster tournament in Banja Luka, SR Bosnia and Herzegovina (part of Yugoslavia at the time), was for juniors, he participated in that event in 1979 while still unrated. He was a replacement for the Soviet defector Viktor Korchnoi, who was originally invited but withdrew due to the threat of a boycott from the Soviets.[34] Kasparov won this high-class tournament, emerging with a provisional rating of 2595, enough to catapult him to the top group of chess players (at the time, number 15 in the world).[35] The next year, 1980, he won the World Junior Chess Championship in Dortmund, West Germany. Later that year, he made his debut as the second reserve for the Soviet Union at the Chess Olympiad at Valletta, Malta, and became a Grandmaster.[36]\nAs a teenager, Kasparov shared the USSR Chess Championship in 1981 with Lev Psakhis (12.5/17), although Psakhis won their game.[37] His first win in a superclass-level international tournament was scored at Bugojno, SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, Yugoslavia in 1982. He earned a place in the 1982 Moscow Interzonal tournament, which he won, to qualify for the Candidates Tournament.[38] At age 19, he was the youngest Candidate since Bobby Fischer, who was 15 when he qualified in 1958. At this stage, he was already the No. 2-rated player in the world, trailing only world champion Karpov on the January 1983 list.[39]\nKasparov's first (quarter-final) Candidates match was against Alexander Beliavsky, whom he defeated 6\u20133 (four wins, one loss).[40] Politics threatened Kasparov's semi-final against Korchnoi, which was scheduled to be played in Pasadena, California. Korchnoi had defected from the Soviet Union in 1976 and was at that time the strongest active non-Soviet player. The Soviet authorities would not allow Kasparov to travel to the United States, meaning that Korchnoi could have had a walkover.[41] This decision was met with disapproval by the chess world, and Korchnoi agreed to the match to being played in London instead, along with the previously scheduled match between Vasily Smyslov and Zolt\u00e1n Ribli. The Kasparov-Korchnoi match was put together on short notice by Raymond Keene. Kasparov lost the first game but won the match 7\u20134 (four wins, one loss).[42]\nIn January 1984, Kasparov became the No. 1 ranked player in the world, with a FIDE rating of 2710. He became the youngest-ever world No. 1, a record that lasted 12 years until being broken by Kramnik in January 1996.[43] That same year, he won the Candidates' final 8\u00bd\u20134\u00bd (four wins, no losses) against former world champion Smyslov at Vilnius, thus qualifying to play Karpov for the world championship.[44]\nThe World Chess Championship 1984 match between Kasparov and Karpov had many ups and downs and a very controversial finish. Karpov started in very good form, and after nine games Kasparov was down 4\u20130 in a \"first to six wins\" match. Fellow players predicted he would be whitewashed 6\u20130 within 18 games.[45]\nIn an unexpected turn of events, there followed a series of 17 successive draws, some relatively short, others drawn in unsettled positions. Kasparov lost game 27 (5\u20130), then fought back with another series of draws until game 32, earning his first-ever win against the world champion and bringing the score to 5\u20131. Another 14 successive draws followed, through game 46; the previous record length for a world title match had been 34 games (Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca vs. Alexander Alekhine in 1927).[46]\nKasparov won games 47 and 48 to bring the score to 5\u20133 in Karpov's favour. Then the match was ended without result by FIDE President Florencio Campomanes, and a new match was announced to start a few months later. The termination was controversial, as both players stated that they preferred the match to continue.[47][48] Announcing his decision, Campomanes cited the health of the players, which had been strained by the length of the match.[49] According to grandmasters Boris Gulko and Korchnoi, and historians Vladimir Popow and Yuri Felshtinsky in their The KGB Plays Chess book, Campomanes had been a KGB agent and was tasked with preventing Karpov's defeat at all costs. The match was terminated while Karpov was still ahead to avoid the impression that the decision had been made for his benefit.[50]\nThe match became the first, and so far only, world championship match to be abandoned without a result. Kasparov's relations with Campomanes and FIDE became strained,[50][51] and matters came to a head in 1993 with Kasparov's complete break-away from FIDE.[52]\nThe second Karpov\u2013Kasparov match in 1985 was organised in Moscow as the best of 24 games, where the first player to win 12\u00bd points would claim the title. The scores from the terminated match would not carry over; however, in the event of a 12\u201312 draw, the title would remain with Karpov. On 9 November 1985, Kasparov secured the world crown by a score of 13\u201311. Karpov, with White, needed to win the 24th game to retain the title but Kasparov won it with the Sicilian Defence.[53] He was 22 years old at the time, making him the youngest-ever world champion,[54] a record held by Mikhail Tal for over 20 years.[55] Kasparov's win with Black in the 16th game has been recognised as one of the all-time chess masterpieces, including being voted the best game played during the first 64 issues of the magazine Chess Informant.[56][57]\nAs part of the arrangements following the aborted 1984 match, Karpov had been granted (in the event of his defeat) a right to rematch. Another match took place in 1986, hosted jointly in London and Leningrad,[58][59] with each city hosting 12 games. At one point in the match, Kasparov opened a three-point lead and looked well on his way to a decisive victory. But Karpov fought back by winning three consecutive games to level the score late in the match. At this point, Kasparov dismissed one of his seconds, grandmaster Evgeny Vladimirov, accusing him of selling his opening preparation to the Karpov team (as described in Kasparov's autobiography Unlimited Challenge, chapter Stab in the Back). Kasparov scored one more win and kept his title by a score of 12\u00bd\u201311\u00bd.[59]\nA fourth match for the world title took place in 1987 in Seville,[60] as Karpov had qualified through the Candidates' Matches to become the official challenger once again. This match was also very close, with neither player holding more than a one-point lead at any time. With one game left, Kasparov was down a point and needed a win to draw the match and retain his title. A long, tense game ensued in which Karpov blundered away a pawn just before the first time control. Kasparov then won a long ending to retain the title on a 12\u201312 scoreline.[61]\nKasparov and Karpov met for a fifth time, on this occasion in New York City and Lyon in 1990, with each city hosting 12 games. Again the result was a close one, with Kasparov winning by a margin of 12\u00bd\u201311\u00bd. In their five world championship matches, Kasparov had 21 wins, 19 losses and 104 draws in 144 games.[62]\nIn November 1986, Kasparov had created the Grandmasters Association (GMA) to represent professional players and give them more say in FIDE's activities.[63] Kasparov assumed a leadership role. GMA's major achievement was in organising a series of six World Cup tournaments for the world's top players.[64] This caused an uneasy relationship to develop between Kasparov and FIDE.[65] The previous month Kasparov had made his feelings clear to fellow grandmaster Keene: \"Campomanes must go. It is war to the death with him as far as I am concerned. I will do everything I can to remove him\u201d.[66]\nThis stand-off lasted until 1993, by which time a new challenger had qualified through the Candidates cycle: Nigel Short, a British grandmaster who had defeated Karpov in a qualifying match and then Jan Timman in the finals held in early 1993.[67] After a confusing and compressed bidding process produced lower financial estimates than expected,[68] the world champion and his challenger both rejected FIDE's bid for an August match in Manchester and decided to play outside FIDE's jurisdiction.[69][70] Their match took place under the auspices of the Professional Chess Association (PCA), an organisation established by Kasparov and Short.[63][71] At this point, a fracture occurred in the lineage of the FIDE World Championship. In an interview in 2007, Kasparov called the break with FIDE in 1993 the worst mistake of his career, as it hurt the game in the long run.[72]\nKasparov and Short were ejected from FIDE and played their well-sponsored match in London in September 1993.[73] Kasparov won convincingly by a score of 12\u00bd\u20137\u00bd. The match considerably raised the profile of chess in the UK, with a substantial level of coverage on Channel 4.[74][75] Meanwhile, FIDE organised its world championship match between Timman (the defeated Candidates finalist) and former world champion Karpov (a defeated Candidates semi-finalist), which Karpov won.[76][77]\nFIDE removed Kasparov and Short from its rating list. Subsequently, the PCA created a rating list of its own, which featured all the world top players regardless of their relation to FIDE. There were now two world champions: PCA champion Kasparov and FIDE champion Karpov.[78] The title remained split for 13 years.\nKasparov defended his PCA title in a 1995 match against Viswanathan Anand at the World Trade Center in New York City. Kasparov won the match by four wins to one, with thirteen draws.[79]\nKasparov tried to organise another world championship match under a different organisation, the World Chess Association (WCA), with Linares organiser Luis Rentero. Alexei Shirov and Kramnik played a candidates match to decide the challenger, which Shirov won in an upset. But when Rentero admitted that the funds required and promised had never materialised, the WCA collapsed. Yet another body stepped in, BrainGames.com, headed by Raymond Keene. After a match with Shirov could not be agreed by BrainGames.com and talks with Anand collapsed, a match was instead arranged against Kramnik.[80]\nDuring this period, Kasparov was approached by Oakham School in the United Kingdom, at the time the only school in the country with a full-time chess coach,[81] and developed an interest in the use of chess in education. In 1997, Kasparov supported a scholarship programme at the school.[82] Kasparov also won the Marca Leyenda trophy that year.[83]\nIn 1999, he played a well-known game against Topalov wherein he won after a rook sacrifice and king hunt.[84][85]\nThe Kasparov-Kramnik match took place in London during the latter half of 2000. Kramnik had been a student of Kasparov's at the famous Botvinnik/Kasparov chess school in Russia and had served on Kasparov's team for the 1995 match with Anand.[86]\nThe better-prepared Kramnik won game 2 against Kasparov's Gr\u00fcnfeld Defence and achieved winning positions in games 4 and 6, although Kasparov managed a draw in both games. Kasparov made a critical error in game 10 with the Nimzo-Indian Defence, which Kramnik exploited to win in 25 moves. As White, Kasparov could not crack the passive but solid Berlin Defence in the Ruy Lopez, and Kramnik managed to draw all his games as Black. Kramnik won the match 8\u00bd\u20136\u00bd.[87]\nKasparov won a series of major tournaments and remained the PCA top-rated player in the world, ahead of both Kramnik and the FIDE World Champion. In 2001 he refused an invitation to the 2002 Dortmund Candidates Tournament for the Classical title, claiming his results had earned him a rematch with Kramnik.[88]\nKasparov and Karpov played a four-game match with rapid time controls over two days in December 2002 in New York City. Kasparov suffered a surprise loss (1.5 \u2013 2.5).[89]\nBecause of Kasparov's continuing strong results and status as FIDE world No. 1, he was included in the so-called \"Prague Agreement\", masterminded by Yasser Seirawan and intended to reunite the two world championships. Kasparov was to play a match against the FIDE World Champion Ponomariov in September 2003.[90] But this match was called off after Ponomariov refused to sign his contract for it without reservation. In its place, there were plans for a match against Rustam Kasimdzhanov, winner of the FIDE World Chess Championship 2004, to be held in January 2005 in the United Arab Emirates. These also fell through owing to a lack of funding. Plans to hold the match in Turkey instead came too late. Kasparov announced in January 2005 that he was tired of waiting for FIDE to arrange a match and had decided to stop all efforts to become undisputed world champion once more.[91]\nAfter winning the prestigious Linares tournament for the ninth time, Kasparov announced on 10 March 2005 that he would retire from regular competitive chess. He cited as the reason a lack of personal goals in the chess world. When winning the Russian championship in 2004, he commented that it had been the last major title he had never won outright. He also expressed frustration at the failure to reunify the world championship.[92][91]\nKasparov said he might play in some rapid chess events for fun, but he intended to spend more time on his books, including the My Great Predecessors series, and work on the links between decision-making in chess and other areas of life. He also stated that he would continue to involve himself in Russian politics, which he viewed as \"headed down the wrong path.\"[93][94]\nOn 22 August 2006, in his first public chess games since his retirement, Kasparov played in the Lichthof Chess Champions Tournament, a blitz event played at the time control of five minutes per side and three-second increments per move. Kasparov tied for first with Karpov, scoring 4\u00bd/6.[95]\nKasparov and Karpov played a 12-game match from 21 to 24 September 2009, in Valencia, Spain. It consisted of four rapid (or semi rapid) games, in which Kasparov won 3\u20131, and eight blitz games, in which Kasparov won 6\u20132, winning the match with a final result of 9\u20133. The event took place exactly 25 years after the two players' unfinished encounter at World Chess Championship 1984.[96]\nKasparov coached Carlsen for approximately one year, beginning in February 2009. The collaboration remained secret until September 2009.[97] Under Kasparov's tutelage, Carlsen in October 2009 became the youngest ever to achieve a FIDE rating higher than 2800, and he rose from world number four to world number one. While the pair initially planned to work together throughout 2010,[98] in March of that year it was announced that Carlsen had split from Kasparov and would no longer be using him as a trainer.[99] According to an interview with the German magazine Der Spiegel, Carlsen indicated that he would remain in contact and that he would continue to attend training sessions with Kasparov;[100] however, no further training sessions were held, and the cooperation fizzled out over the course of the spring.[101] In 2011, Carlsen said: \"Thanks to [Kasparov] I began to understand a whole class of positions better.\u00a0... Kasparov gave me a great deal of practical help.\"[102] In 2012, when asked what he learnt from working with Kasparov, Carlsen answered: \"Complex positions. That was the most important thing.\"[103]\nIn May 2010, Kasparov played and won 30 games simultaneously against players at Tel Aviv University in Israel.[104] In the same month, it was revealed that he had aided Anand in his preparation for the World Chess Championship 2010 against challenger Veselin Topalov. Anand won the match 6\u00bd\u20135\u00bd to retain the title.[105]\nKasparov began training the U.S. grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura in January 2011. The first of several training sessions was held in New York just before Nakamura participated in the Tata Steel Chess tournament in Wijk aan Zee, the Netherlands.[106] In December 2011, it was announced that their cooperation had come to an end.[107]\nKasparov played two blitz exhibition matches in the autumn of 2011. The first was in September against French grandmaster Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, in Clichy (France), which Kasparov won 1\u00bd\u2013\u00bd.[108] The second was a longer match consisting of eight blitz games played on 9 October, against English grandmaster Short. Kasparov won again by a score of 4\u00bd\u20133\u00bd.[109][110] A little after that, in October 2011, Kasparov played and defeated fourteen opponents in a simultaneous exhibition that took place in Bratislava.[111]\nOn 25 and 26 April 2015, Kasparov played a mini-match against Short. The match consisted of two rapid games and eight blitz games and was contested over the course of two days. Commentators GM Maurice Ashley and Alejandro Ram\u00edrez remarked how Kasparov was an 'initiative hog' throughout the match, consistently not allowing Short to gain any foothold in the games. Kasparov won the match decisively (8\u00bd\u20131\u00bd),[112] winning all five games on the second day. These victories were characterised by aggressive pawn moves breaking up Short's position, thereby allowing Kasparov's pieces to achieve positional superiority.[113]\nKasparov played and won all nineteen games of a simultaneous exhibition in Pula, Croatia on 19 August 2015.[114] At the Chess Club and Scholastic Center of Saint Louis on 28 and 29 April 2016, Kasparov played a 6-round exhibition blitz round-robin tournament with Fabiano Caruana, Wesley So and Nakamura in an event called the Ultimate Blitz Challenge.[115] He finished the tournament third with 9.5/18, behind Nakamura (11/18) and So (10/18). At the post-tournament interview, Kasparov announced that he would donate his winnings from playing the next top-level blitz exhibition match to assist funding of the American Olympic Team.[116]\nOn 2 June 2016, Kasparov played against fifteen chess players in a simultaneous exhibition in the Kaiser-Friedrich-Halle of M\u00f6nchengladbach. He won all games.[117]\nOn 7 October 2013, Kasparov announced his candidacy for World Chess Federation president during a reception in Tallinn, Estonia, where the 84th FIDE Congress took place.[118] He was supported by reigning world champion and FIDE #1 ranked player Carlsen.[119] At the FIDE General Assembly in August 2014, Kasparov lost the presidential election to the incumbent Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, with a vote of 110\u201361.[120]\nA few days before the election took place, the New York Times Magazine had published a report on the viciously fought campaign. Included was information about a leaked contract between Kasparov and former FIDE Secretary General Ignatius Leong from Singapore, in which the Kasparov campaign reportedly \"offered to pay Leong US$500,000 and to pay $250,000 a year for four years to the ASEAN Chess Academy, an organisation Leong helped create to teach the game, specifying that Leong would be responsible for delivering 11 votes from his region [...]\".[121] In September 2015, the FIDE Ethics Commission found Kasparov and Leong guilty of violating its Code of Ethics[122] and later suspended them for two years from all FIDE functions and meetings.[123]\nKasparov came out of retirement to participate in the inaugural St. Louis Rapid and Blitz tournament from 14 to 19 August 2017, scoring 3.5/9 in the rapid and 9/18 in the blitz. He finished eighth in a strong field of ten, including Nakamura, Caruana, former world champion Anand and the eventual winner, Levon Aronian.[124][125] Kasparov promised that any tournament money he earned would go towards charities to promote chess in Africa.[126]\nIn 2020, he participated in 9LX, a Chess 960 tournament, and finished eighth of a field of ten players.[127] His game against Carlsen, who tied for first place, was drawn.[128]\nHe launched Kasparovchess, a subscription-based online chess community featuring documentaries, lessons, puzzles, podcasts, articles, interviews and playing zones, in 2021.[129]\nKasparov played in the blitz section of the Grand Chess Tour 2021 event in Zagreb, Croatia. He performed poorly, however, scoring 0.5/9 on the first day and 2/9 on the second day, getting his only win against Jorden Van Foreest.[130][131] He also participated in 9LX 2, finishing fifth in a field of ten players, with a score of 5/9.[132]\nKasparov played in a total of eight Chess Olympiads. He represented the Soviet Union four times and Russia four times, following the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991. In his 1980 Olympiad debut, he became, at age 17, the youngest player to represent the Soviet Union or Russia at that level, a record which was broken by Kramnik in 1992. In 82 games, he scored (+50\u22123=29), for 78.7%, and won a total of nineteen medals, including team gold medals all eight times he competed.[133]\nFor the 1994 Moscow Olympiad, he had a significant organisational role in helping to put together the event on short notice, after Thessaloniki cancelled its offer to host only a few weeks before the scheduled dates. Kasparov's detailed Olympiad record follows:[134]\nKasparov made his international debut for the USSR at age 16 in the 1980 European Team Championship and played for Russia in the 1992 edition of that championship. He won a total of five medals. His detailed record in this event follows:[135]\nKasparov also represented the USSR once at the Youth Olympiad in Austria (1981). He scored 9/10 (+8\u20130=2) on the top board and his team lifted the title.[136]\nKasparov received a Chess Oscar eleven times as the best chess player of the year, in 1982-1983, 1985-1988, 1995-1996, 1999, and 2001-2002.[137] Between 1981 and 1991, he won or tied for first place in every tournament he entered.[138] In 1999, Kasparov reached an Elo rating of 2851 points, a record that stood for over thirteen years: on 10 December 2012, Carlsen achieved an unofficial rating of 2861 points, with which he topped the next release of the rating in January 2013.[139][140] With the exception of the PCA period and sharing first place with Kramnik in 1997, Kasparov led the rating list from 1985 to 2006. On 1 January 2006, Kasparov ranked first with a coefficient of 2812. However, he was excluded from the FIDE rating list of 1 April 2006 because he had not participated in tournaments for the previous twelve months.[141]\nThe rivalry between Kasparov and Karpov (often referred to as the \"two Ks\")[142] is one of the greatest in the history of chess. In six years they played five matches comprising 144 games.[143][144] For a long time there was personal enmity between Karpov and Kasparov.[145] The conflict between the two men also had a political connotation. Karpov was considered a representative of the Soviet nomenklatura, while Kasparov was young and popular, positioned himself as a \"child of change\", willingly gave candid interviews and (especially in the West) had an aura of a rebel, although he never was a dissident.[144] Kasparov's 1985 victory coincided with the start of perestroika in the Soviet Union.[146]\nCarlsen said of Kasparov: \"I've never seen someone with such a feel for dynamics in complex positions.\"[147] Kramnik has opined that Kasparov's \"capacity for study is second to none\", adding \"There is nothing in chess he has been unable to deal with.\"[148]\nIn 2007, the international consulting company Synectics published a rating of 100 living geniuses in science, politics, art and entrepreneurship, in which Kasparov ranked 25th.[149]\nKramnik called Kasparov a chess player with virtually no weaknesses.[150] His games are characterised by a dynamic style of play with a focus on tactics, depth of strategy, subtle calculation and original opening ideas.[151] Kasparov was known for his extensive opening preparation and aggressive play in it.[152][153] Sergey Shipov considered Kasparov's moral and volitional qualities (impulsiveness and psychological instability) and excessive reliance on options, which can lead to overwork and mistakes, as amongst his few shortcomings.[154]\nKasparov's attacking style of play has been compared by many to Alekhine,[155][156] his chess idol since childhood. Kasparov has described his style as being influenced chiefly by Alekhine, Tal and Fischer.[157] Other influences on Kasparov were his early coaches. At a young age, he met with experienced teachers Alexander Nikitin and Alexander Shakarov. Shakarov collected and systematised materials, and then became the keeper of Kasparov's information bank. A revolutionary step at that time was the involvement of computer programs in analysing games, and it was Kasparov and his team who took the first steps in this direction.[158][159] In 1973, Kasparov entered the Botvinnik school and immediately attracted attention. Botvinnik commented on the young schoolboy: \"Garry's speed and memory capacity are amazing. He counts deep variations and finds unexpected moves. The power of combinational vision makes him similar to Alekhine himself\".[160]\nKasparov's contribution to opening theory is acknowledged. In the 1990s, he systematically developed new variants with computer programs. Kasparov's favourite opening systems were the Queen's Indian with White and variations of the Sicilian Defence with Black.[160][161] He also \"reanimated\" the Scotch Game in top-level competitions. Kasparov successfully used this opening, which was considered outdated, in the 1990 match against Karpov and in matches with Short and Anand.[162] One of the offshoots of the Sicilian in the Sz\u00e9n Variation is called the Kasparov Gambit.[163] Kasparov used this variation in the 12th and 16th games of the match with Karpov in 1985; in the second of these games, he scored a victory.[163]\nAnother well-known case of winning an important game thanks to a novelty in the opening is Kasparov's 10th game of the 1995 match against Anand. On the 14th move, in a well-known position of the open variation of the Spanish Game (Rui Lopez), Kasparov discovered a new idea with a rook sacrifice, which brought a decisive attack.[164]\nKasparov has also co-authored several books on opening theory.[165]\nKasparov holds the record for the longest time as the No. 1 rated player in the world\u2014from 1984 to 2005 (Kramnik shared the No. 1 ranking with him once, in the January 1996 FIDE rating list).[166] He headed the PCA rating list during the split from FIDE. At the time of his retirement, he was still ranked No. 1 in the world, with a rating of 2812. His rating has fallen inactive since the January 2006 rating list.[167]\nIn January 1990, Kasparov achieved the (then) highest FIDE rating ever, passing 2800 and breaking Fischer's old record of 2785. By the July 1999 and January 2000 FIDE rating lists, Kasparov had reached a 2851 Elo rating, at that time the highest rating ever achieved.[168] He held that record until Carlsen attained a new record high rating of 2861 in January 2013.[169]\nKasparov holds the record for most consecutive professional tournament victories, placing first or equal first in fifteen individual tournaments from 1981 to 1990.[170] The streak was broken by Vasyl Ivanchuk at Linares 1991, where Kasparov placed second, half a point behind him after losing their individual game. The details of this record winning streak follow:[38]\nKasparov went nine years winning every super-tournament he played, in addition to contesting his series of five consecutive matches with Karpov. \nHis only failure in this time period in either tournament or match play was the 1984 world title match against Karpov.\nIn the late 1990s, Kasparov went on another long streak of ten consecutive super-tournament wins.[171]\nIn these tournament victories, Kasparov had a score of 53 wins, 61 draws and 1 loss in 115 games, his only defeat coming against Ivan Sokolov in Wijk aan Zee 1999.\nAcorn Computers acted as one of the sponsors for Kasparov's Candidates semi-final match against Korchnoi in 1983. This was Kasparov's first introduction to computers. Kasparov was awarded a BBC Micro, which he took back with him to Baku, making it perhaps one of the first Western-made microcomputers to reach the Soviet Union at that time.[172]\nComputer chess magazine editor Frederic Friedel consulted with Kasparov in 1985 on how a chess database program would be useful preparation for competition. Friedel founded Chessbase two years later, and he gave a copy of the program to Kasparov, who started using it in his preparation.[173] That same year, Kasparov played against thirty-two chess computers in Hamburg, winning all games.[174] Several commercially available Kasparov computers were made in the 1980s, the Saitek Kasparov Turbo King models.[175][176][177] On 22 October 1989, Kasparov defeated the chess computer Deep Thought in both games of a two-game match.[178] In December 1992, Kasparov played thirty-seven blitz games against Fritz 2 in Cologne, winning 24, drawing 4 and losing 9.[179]\nKasparov cooperated in producing video material for the computer game Kasparov's Gambit released by Electronic Arts in November 1993. In April 1994, Intel acted as a sponsor for the first Professional Chess Association Grand Prix event in Moscow, played at a time control of twenty-five minutes per game. In May, Chessbase's Fritz 3 running on an Intel Pentium PC defeated Kasparov in their first game in the Intel Express blitz tournament in Munich, but Kasparov managed to tie it for first and won the play-off (+3=2). The next day, Kasparov lost to Fritz 3 again in a game on ZDF TV.[180] In August, Kasparov was knocked out of the London Intel Grand Prix by Richard Lang's ChessGenius 2 program in the first round.[181] In 1995, during Kasparov's world title match with Anand, he unveiled an opening novelty that had been checked with a chess engine, an approach that would become increasingly common in subsequent years.[182]\nKasparov played in a pair of six-game chess matches with IBM supercomputer Deep Blue. The first match took place in Philadelphia in February 1996 and was won by Kasparov (4-2).[183] The second was played in New York City in May 1997 and won by Deep Blue (3\u00bd\u20132\u00bd). The 1997 match was the first defeat of a reigning world champion by a computer under tournament conditions.[184]\nThe match was even after five games but Kasparov lost quickly in Game 6. Kasparov said that he was \"not well prepared\" to face Deep Blue in 1997. He said that based on his \"objective strengths\" his play was stronger than that of Deep Blue.[185] Kasparov claimed that several factors weighed against him in this match. In particular, he was denied access to Deep Blue's recent games, in contrast to the computer's team, which could study hundreds of Kasparov's.[186]\nAfter the loss, Kasparov said that he sometimes saw deep intelligence and creativity in the machine's moves, suggesting that during the second game chess players had intervened in contravention of the rules. IBM denied that it had cheated, stating the only human intervention occurred between games. The rules provided for the developers to modify the program between games, an opportunity they said they used to shore up weaknesses in the computer's play revealed during the course of the match.[186] Kasparov requested printouts of the machine's log files but IBM refused, although the company later published them on the Internet.[187] Much later, it was suggested that the behaviour Kasparov noted had resulted from a glitch in the computer program.[188] Plans for further engagement between Kasparov and IBM, including a rematch, did not come to fruition, due to the accusations of cheating.[189]\nIn January 2003, he engaged in a six-game classical time control match, with a $1\u00a0million prize fund, against Deep Junior. It was billed as the FIDE \"Man vs. Machine\" world championship.[190] The engine evaluated three million positions per second.[191] After one win each and three draws, it was all up to the final game. After reaching a decent position, Kasparov offered a draw, which was accepted by the Deep Junior team. Asked why he had offered the draw, Kasparov said he feared making a blunder.[192] Deep Junior was the first machine to beat Kasparov with Black and at a standard time control.[193]\nIn June 2003, Mindscape released the computer game Kasparov Chessmate, with Kasparov himself listed as a co-designer.[194] In November 2003, he engaged in a four-game match against the computer program X3D Fritz, using a virtual board, 3D glasses and a speech recognition system. After two draws and one win apiece, the X3D Man\u2013Machine match ended in a draw. Kasparov received $175,000 and took home a golden trophy. He continued to regret the blunder in the second game that cost him a crucial point. He felt that he had outplayed the machine overall and performed well: \"I only made one mistake but unfortunately that one mistake lost the game.\"[195]\nIn 2021, Kasparov promoted a series of 32 NFTs that detailed important moments in his career. The top four sold for more than $11,000.[196][197][198]\nKasparov's grandfather was a staunch communist, but the young Kasparov gradually began to have doubts about the Soviet Union's political system at age 13 when he travelled abroad for the first time in 1976 to Paris for a chess tournament.[199] In 1981, at age 18, he read Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's The Gulag Archipelago, a copy of which he bought while abroad.[200] Nevertheless, Kasparov joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) in 1984, and was elected to the Central Committee of Komsomol in 1987. In 1990, he left the party.[201]\nIn May 1990, Kasparov took part in the creation of the Democratic Party of Russia.[202] He left the party on 28 April 1991, after its conference.[203] Kasparov was also involved with the creation of the \"Choice of Russia\" bloc of parties in June 1993. He took part in the election campaign of Boris Yeltsin in 1996. In 2001 he voiced his support for the Russian television channel NTV.[18]\nAfter his retirement from chess in 2005, Kasparov turned to politics and created the United Civil Front, a social movement whose main goal is to \"work to preserve electoral democracy in Russia\".[204] He has vowed to \"restore democracy\" to Russia by restoring the rule of law.[205][206][207] A year later the United Civil Front became part of The Other Russia. Kasparov was instrumental in setting up this coalition, which opposes Putin's government. The Other Russia was boycotted by the leaders of Russia's mainstream opposition parties, Yabloko and Union of Right Forces, due to its inclusion of both nationalist and radical groups. Kasparov has criticised these two parties as being secretly under the auspices of the Kremlin.[208]\nIn April 2005, Kasparov was in Moscow at a promotional event when he was struck over the head with a chessboard he had just signed. The assailant was reported to have said: \"I admired you as a chess player, but you gave that up for politics\" immediately before the attack.[209] Kasparov has been the subject of a number of other episodes since, including police brutality and alleged harassment from the Russian secret service.[210][211]\nKasparov helped organise the Saint Petersburg Dissenters' March on 3 March 2007 and The March of the Dissenters on 24 March 2007, both involving several thousand people rallying against Putin and Saint Petersburg Governor Valentina Matviyenko.[212][213]\nKasparov led a pro-democracy demonstration in Moscow in April 2007. Soon after it started, however, over 9,000 police descended on the group and seized almost everyone. Kasparov, who was briefly arrested, was warned by the prosecution office on the eve of the march that anyone participating risked being detained. He was held for some ten hours and then fined and released.[214] He was later summoned by the FSB for violations of Russian anti-extremism laws.[215]\nSpeaking about Kasparov in 2007, former KGB defector Oleg Kalugin remarked: \"I do not talk in details\u00a0\u2013 people who knew them are all dead now because they were vocal, they were open. I am quiet. There is only one man who is vocal and he may be in trouble: world chess champion Kasparov. He has been very outspoken in his attacks on Putin and I believe that he is probably next on the list.\"[216]\nOn 30 September 2007, Kasparov entered the Russian presidential race, receiving 379 of 498 votes at a congress held in Moscow by The Other Russia.[217] In October 2007, Kasparov announced his intention of standing for the Russian presidency as the candidate of the \"Other Russia\" coalition and vowed to fight for a \"democratic and just Russia\". Later that month he travelled to the United States, where he appeared on several popular television programmes.[218]\nIn November 2007, Kasparov and other protesters were detained by police at an Other Russia rally in Moscow, which drew 3,000 demonstrators to protest against election rigging. Following an attempt by about 100 protesters to march through police lines to the electoral commission, which had barred Other Russia candidates from parliamentary elections, arrests were made. The Russian authorities stated a rally had been approved but not any marches, resulting in several demonstrators being detained.[219] Kasparov was subsequently charged with resisting arrest and organising an unauthorised protest, and was given a jail sentence of five days. Kasparov appealed the charges, citing that he had been following orders given by the police. He was released from jail on 29 November.[220] Putin castigated Kasparov at the rally for his use of English when speaking rather than Russian.[221]\nIn December 2007, Kasparov announced that he had to withdraw his presidential candidacy due to inability to rent a meeting hall where at least 500 of his supporters could assemble. With the deadline expiring on that date, he explained it was impossible for him to run. Russian election laws required sufficient meeting hall space for assembling supporters. Kasparov's spokeswoman accused the government of using pressure to deter anyone from renting a hall for the gathering and said that the electoral commission had rejected a proposal that would have allowed for smaller gathering sizes rather than one large gathering at a meeting hall.[222]\nKasparov was among the 34 first signatories and a key organiser of the online anti-Putin campaign \"Putin must go\", started on 10 March 2010. Within the text is a call to Russian law enforcement to ignore Putin's orders. By June 2011, there were 90,000 signatures. While the identity of the petition author remained anonymous, there was wide speculation that it was indeed Kasparov.[223][224][225][226] On 31 January 2012, Kasparov hosted a meeting of opposition leaders planning a mass march on 4 February 2012, the third major opposition rally held since the disputed State Duma elections of December 2011. Among other opposition leaders attending were Alexey Navalny and Yevgenia Chirikova.[227]\nKasparov was arrested and beaten outside a Moscow court on 17 August 2012 while attending sentencing in the case involving the all-female punk band Pussy Riot.[228] On 24 August, he was cleared of charges that he had taken part in an unauthorised protest against the conviction of three members of the band. Judge Yekaterina Veklich said there were \"no grounds to believe the testimony of the police\".[229] Kasparov later thanked all the bloggers and reporters who provided video evidence that contradicted the testimony of the police.[230] Kasparov wrote in February 2013 that \"fascism has come to Russia. ...Project Putin, just like the old Project Hitler, is but the fruit of a conspiracy by the ruling elite. Fascist rule was never the result of the free will of the people. It was always the fruit of a conspiracy by the ruling elites!\"[231]\nKasparov denied rumours in April 2013 that he was planning to leave Russia for good. \"I found these rumors to be deeply saddening and, moreover, surprising,\" he wrote. \"I was unable to respond immediately because I was in such a state of shock that such an incredibly inaccurate statement, the likes of which is constantly distributed by the Kremlin's propagandists, came this time from Ilya Yashin, a fellow member of the Opposition Coordination Council (KSO) and my former colleague from the Solidarity movement.\"[232] He also accused prominent Russian journalist Vladimir Posner of failing to stand up to Putin and to earlier Russian and Soviet leaders.[233]\nHowever, Kasparov subsequently fled Russia less than three months later. On 6 June 2013, he announced that he had left his homeland on account of fear of persecution for his political views.[234] Further, at the 2013 Women in the World conference, Kasparov told The Daily Beast's Michael Moynihan that democracy no longer existed in what he called Russia's \"dictatorship\".[235]\nKasparov said at a press conference in June 2013 that if he returned to Russia, he doubted he would be allowed to leave again, given Putin's ongoing crackdown on dissenters. \"So for the time being,\" he said, \"I refrain from returning to Russia.\" He explained shortly thereafter in an article for The Daily Beast that this had not been intended as \"a declaration of leaving my home country, permanently or otherwise\", but merely an expression of \"the dark reality of the situation in Russia today, where nearly half the members of the opposition's Coordinating Council are under criminal investigation on concocted charges\". He noted that the Moscow prosecutor's office was \"opening an investigation that would limit my ability to travel\", making it impossible for him to fulfil \"professional speaking engagements\" and hindering his \"work for the non-profit Kasparov Chess Foundation, which has centres in New York City, Brussels and Johannesburg, to promote chess in education\".[235] Kasparov further wrote in his June 2013 Daily Beast article that the mass protests in Moscow 18 months earlier against fraudulent Russian elections had been \"a proud moment for me\". He recalled that after joining the opposition movement in March 2005, he had been criticised for seeking to unite \"every anti-Putin element in the country to march together regardless of ideology\". Therefore, the sight of \"hundreds of flags representing every group from liberals to nationalists all marching together for 'Russia Without Putin' was the fulfillment of a dream.\" Yet most Russians, he lamented, had continued to \"slumber\" even as Putin had \"taken off the flimsy mask of democracy to reveal himself in full as the would-be KGB dictator he has always been\".[236]\nKasparov responded with several Twitter postings to a September 2013 The New York Times op-ed by Putin. \"I hope Putin has taken adequate protections,\" he tweeted. \"Now that he is a Russian journalist his life may be in grave danger!\" Also: \"Now we can expect NY Times op-eds by Mugabe on fair elections, Castro on free speech, & Kim Jong-un on prison reform. The Axis of Hypocrisy.\"[237]\nKasparov wrote in July 2013 about the trial in Kirov of fellow opposition leader Navalny, who had been convicted \"on concocted embezzlement charges\", only to see the prosecutor, surprisingly, ask for his release the next day pending appeal. \"The judicial process and the democratic process in Russia,\" wrote Kasparov, \"are both elaborate mockeries created to distract the citizenry at home and to help Western leaders avoid confronting the awkward fact that Russia has returned to a police state\". Still, Kasparov felt that whatever had caused the Kirov prosecutor's about-face, \"my optimism tells me it was a positive sign. After more than 13 years of predictable repression under Putin, anything different is good.\"[238]\nKasparov has been outspoken regarding Putin's antigay laws, describing them as \"only the most recent encroachment on the freedom of speech and association of Russia's citizens\", which the international community had largely ignored. Regarding Russia's hosting of the 2014 Winter Olympics, Kasparov explained in August 2013 that he had opposed Russia's bid from the outset, since it would \"allow Vladimir Putin's cronies to embezzle hundreds of millions of dollars\" and \"lend prestige to Putin's authoritarian regime\". Kasparov did not support the proposed Sochi Olympics boycott\u2014writing that it would \"unfairly punish athletes\"\u2014but called for athletes and others to \"transform Putin's self-congratulatory pet project into a spotlight that exposes his authoritarian rule\" to the world.[239] In September, Kasparov called upon politicians to refuse to attend the games and the public to pressure sponsors and the media, such that Coca-Cola, for example, could put \"a rainbow flag on each Coca-Cola can\" and NBC could \"do interviews with Russian gay activists or with Russian political activists\". Kasparov also emphasised that although he was \"still a Russian citizen\", he had \"good reason to be concerned about my ability to leave Russia if I returned to Moscow\".[240]\nKasparov spoke out against the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea and has stated that control of Crimea should be returned to Ukraine after the overthrow of Putin without additional conditions.[241] Kasparov's website was blocked by the Russian government censorship agency, Roskomnadzor, at the behest of the public prosecutor, allegedly due to Kasparov's opinions on the Crimean crisis. Kasparov's block was made in unison with several other notable Russian sites that were accused of inciting public outrage. Reportedly, several of the blocked sites received an affidavit noting their violations. However, Kasparov stated that his site had received no such notice of violations after its block.[242] In 2015, a whole note on Kasparov was removed from a Russian language encyclopaedia of greatest Soviet players after an intervention from \"senior leadership\".[243]\nIn October 2015, Kasparov published a book titled Winter Is Coming: Why Vladimir Putin and the Enemies of the Free World Must Be Stopped. In the book, Kasparov likens Putin to Adolf Hitler and explains the need for the West to oppose Putin sooner, rather than appeasing him and postponing the eventual confrontation. According to his publisher, \"Kasparov wants this book out fast, in a way that has potential to influence the discussion during the primary season.\"[244][245] In 2018, he said that \"anything is better than Putin because that eliminates the probability of a nuclear war. Putin is insane.\"[10]\nFollowing reports of Russian ransomware attacks against American agencies and companies in 2021, Kasparov stated that \"the only language that Putin understands is power, and his power is his money,\" arguing that the United States should target the bank accounts of Russian oligarchs to force Russia to rein in its criminals' cyberattacks.[246]\nKasparov spoke out against the invasion of Ukraine by Russia on Twitter: \"The only way this really ends is the fall of Putin's regime by collapse of Russian economy and defeat in Ukraine.\"[247] He also believed that \"pressure must be kept up\" in terms of sanctions and condemnations against Russia's actions[248] and joined with other prominent Russian figures-in-exile to form the Anti-War Committee of Russia.[249] He said that Russia should be \"thrown back into the Stone Age to make sure that the oil and gas industry and any other sensitive industries that are vital for survival of the regime cannot function without Western technological support.\"[250]\nOn 20 May 2022, Kasparov was designated as \"foreign agent\" by the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation.[251]\nKasparov received the Keeper of the Flame award in 1991 from the Center for Security Policy, a Washington, D.C.-based far-right, anti-Muslim think tank. In his acceptance speech Kasparov lauded the defeat of communism while also urging the United States to give no financial assistance to central Soviet leaders.[252][253][254][255] Kasparov gave speeches at other think tanks such as the Hoover Institution.[252]\nIn a 12 May 2013 op-ed for The Wall Street Journal, Kasparov questioned reports that the Russian security agency, the FSB, had fully cooperated with the FBI in the matter of the Boston bombers. He noted that the elder bomber, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, had reportedly met in Russia with two known jihadists who \"were killed in Dagestan by the Russian military just days before Tamerlan left Russia for the U.S.\" Kasparov argued, \"If no intelligence was sent from Moscow to Washington\" about this meeting, \"all this talk of FSB cooperation cannot be taken seriously.\" He further observed, \"This would not be the first time Russian security forces seemed strangely impotent in the face of an impending terror attack,\" pointing out that in both the 2002 Moscow theater siege and the 2004 Beslan school attack, \"there were FSB informants in both terror groups \u2013 yet the attacks went ahead unimpeded.\" Given this history, he wrote, \"it is impossible to overlook that the Boston bombing took place just days after the U.S. Magnitsky List was published, creating the first serious external threat to the Putin power structure by penalising Russian officials complicit in human-rights crimes.\" In sum, Putin's \"dubious record on counterterrorism and its continued support of terror sponsors Iran and Syria mean only one thing: common ground zero\".[256]\nIn the 2016 United States presidential election, Kasparov described Republican Donald Trump as \"a celebrity showman with racist leanings and authoritarian tendencies\"[257] and criticised him for calling for closer ties with Putin.[258] After Trump's running mate, Mike Pence, called Putin a strong leader, Kasparov said that Putin is a strong leader \"in the same way arsenic is a strong drink\".[259][260] He also disparaged the economic policies of Democratic primary candidate Bernie Sanders, but showed respect for Sanders as \"a charismatic speaker and a passionate believer in his cause\".[261] Kasparov opined that Henry Kissinger \"was selling the Trump Administration on the idea of a mirror of 1972 [Richard Nixon's visit to China], except, instead of a Sino-U.S. alliance against the U.S.S.R., this would be a Russian-American alliance against China.\"[10]\nIn an interview discussing the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, Kasparov stated that the Republic of Artsakh has a right to independence and that Azerbaijan has no sovereign right over it. He considers this stance to be objective and without bias, as Soviet law allowed for autonomous republics (such as the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast) to vote for independence separately and were given an equal right for self-determination, a factor he felt often went ignored.[262] Kasparov recalled that he was criticised by Armenians for not taking a strong stance when the Karabakh movement began in 1988, explaining that he was living in Baku with 200,000 other Armenians at the time and did not want to increase tensions.[263] Kasparov and his family later fled Baku in January 1990 to escape pogroms against Armenians.[264][265]\nHe welcomed the Velvet Revolution in Armenia in 2018.[266] Kasparov supports Armenian genocide recognition.[267][268][269][270]\nDuring the Yugoslav Wars, Kasparov advocated for the Western world to destroy the Yugoslav People's Army and accused Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 of creating a \"siege mentality\" to maintain control over Serbia.[271] In 1997, he was awarded honorary citizenship of Bosnia and Herzegovina for his support of Bosnian people during the Bosnian War.[272] Kasparov was named Chairman of the Human Rights Foundation in 2011.[273] In addition, Kasparov was presented with the Morris B. Abram Human Rights Award, UN Watch's annual human-rights prize, in 2013. The organisation praised him as \"not only one of the world's smartest men\" but \"also among its bravest\".[274]\nIn April 2013, Kasparov joined in an HRF condemnation of Kanye West for having performed for the leader of Kazakhstan in exchange for a payment of $3\u00a0million, saying that West \"has entertained a brutal killer and his entourage\" and that his fee \"came from the loot stolen from the Kazakhstan treasury\".[275] Further, in September 2013, Kasparov wrote in Time magazine that in Syria, Putin and Bashar al-Assad \"won by forfeit when President Obama, Prime Minister Cameron and the rest of the so-called leaders of the free world walked away from the table.\" Kasparov lamented the \"new game at the negotiating table where Putin and Assad set the rules and will run the show under the protection of the U.N.\"[276] Kasparov said in September 2013 that Russia was now a dictatorship.[277] In the same month he told an interviewer that \"Obama going to Russia now is dead wrong, morally and politically,\" because Putin's regime \"is behind Assad\".[278]\nKasparov was critical of the violence unleashed by the Spanish police against the 2017 independence referendum in Catalonia and accused the Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy of \"betraying\" the European promise of peace.[279] After the Catalan regional election held later the same year, Kasparov wrote: \"Despite unprecedented pressure from Madrid, Catalonian separatists won a majority. Europe must speak and help find a peaceful path toward resolution and avoid more violence\".[280][281] Kasparov recommended that Spain look to how Britain handled the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, adding: \"look only at how Turkey and Iraq have treated the separatist Kurds. That cannot be the road for Spain and Catalonia.\"[282]\nOn the occasion of the 2015 centennial of the Armenian genocide, Kasparov reflected that in 2002 he called for Turkey to be admitted to the European Union if Turkey recognised the genocide.[283] He condemned the assassination of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.[284] In October 2018, Kasparov wrote that  President Erdo\u011fan's regime in Turkey \"has jailed more journalists than any country in the world and scores of them remain in prison in Turkey. Since 2016, Turkey's intelligence agency has abducted at least 80 people in operations in 18 countries.\"[284]\nKasparov had maintained a summer home in the Croatian city of Makarska. In February 2014, he applied for citizenship by naturalisation in Croatia, according to media reports, claiming he was finding it increasingly difficult to live in Russia. According to an article in The Guardian, Kasparov was \"widely perceived\" as having been a vocal supporter of Croatian independence during the early 1990s.[285] Later in February 2014, his application for naturalisation was approved and he had a meeting with Croatian prime minister Zoran Milanovi\u0107 on 27 February.[286] Croatian press cited his \"lobbying for Croatia in 1991\" as grounds for the expedited naturalisation.[286] In an interview for a Croatian daily published in February 2022, Kasparov said he was \"very grateful\" to Milanovi\u0107 for the help rendered by him (then as prime minister) in obtaining Croatian citizenship.[287]\nKasparov has written books on chess. He published a controversial[288] autobiography when still in his early 20s. Originally entitled Child of Change, it was later published as Unlimited Challenge. This book was updated several times after he became world champion. Its content is mainly literary, with a small chess component of key unannotated games. He published an annotated games collection in 1983, Fighting Chess: My Games and Career,[289] which has been updated in further editions. He also wrote a book annotating the games from his World Chess Championship 1985 victory, World Chess Championship Match: Moscow, 1985.[290]\nHe has annotated his own games extensively for the Yugoslav Chess Informant series.[291] In 1982, he co-authored Batsford Chess Openings with British grandmaster Keene. That book sold well and was updated in a second edition in 1989.[292] He also co-authored two opening books with his trainer Alexander Nikitin in the 1980s for British publisher Batsford\u00a0\u2013 on the Classical Variation of the Caro-Kann Defence and on the Scheveningen Variation of the Sicilian Defence.[293] Kasparov also contributed extensively to the five-volume openings series Encyclopedia of Chess Openings from Chess Informant, for which Kasparov also wrote personal columns called Garry's Choice.[294][295]\nIn 2000, Kasparov co-authored Kasparov Against the World: The Story of the Greatest Online Challenge[296] with grandmaster Daniel King. The 202-page book analyses the 1999 Kasparov versus the World game, and holds the record for the longest analysis devoted to a single chess game.[297]\nIn 2003, the first volume of his five-volume work Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors was published. This volume deals with world champions Wilhelm Steinitz, Emanuel Lasker, Capablanca and Alekhine, and some of their strong contemporaries. It won the British Chess Federation's Book of the Year award in 2003. Volume two, covering Max Euwe, Botvinnik, Smyslov and Tal, appeared later in 2003. Volume three, featuring Tigran Petrosian and Boris Spassky, was published in early 2004. In December 2004, Kasparov released volume four, which covers Samuel Reshevsky, Miguel Najdorf and Bent Larsen (none of whom was world champion), but focuses on Fischer. The fifth volume, devoted to the chess careers of world champion Karpov and challenger Korchnoi, was published in March 2006.[298]\nHis Revolution in the 70s (published in March 2007) covers \"the openings revolution of the 1970s\u20131980s\" and was the first work in a new venture, \"Modern Chess Series\", which recounted his matches with Karpov and selected games. Revolution in the 70s is about the development of opening theory witnessed in that decade. Systems like the novel \"Hedgehog\" opening plan of passively developing the pieces no further than the first three ranks were examined in great detail. Kasparov also analysed some of the most notable games played in that period. In a section at the end of the book, top opening theoreticians provided their opinion on progress made in opening theory in the 1980s.[165]\nFrom 2011\u201314, Kasparov published a three-volume series of his games, spanning his career in three eras until he stopped playing full time in 2005.[299]\nIn October 2015, Kasparov published a book titled Winter Is Coming: Why Vladimir Putin and the Enemies of the Free World Must Be Stopped. The title is a reference to the HBO television series Game of Thrones. In the book, Kasparov writes about the need for an organisation composed solely of democratic countries to replace the United Nations. In an interview, he called the United Nations a \"catwalk for dictators\".[300]\nKasparov believes that the conventional history of civilisation is incorrect. Specifically, he contends that the history of ancient civilisations is based on misdating of events and achievements that occurred in the medieval period.[301][302] He has cited several aspects of ancient history that, he argues, are likely to be anachronisms.[303]\nKasparov has written in support of the pseudohistorical New Chronology (Fomenko), although with some reservations.[304] In 2001, he expressed a desire to devote his time to promoting the New Chronology after his chess career. \"New Chronology is a great area for investing my intellect\u00a0... My analytical abilities are well placed to figure out what was right and what was wrong.\"[305] \"When I stop playing chess, it may well be that I concentrate on promoting these ideas... I believe they can improve our lives.\"[305] Later, Kasparov renounced his support of Fomenko theories but reaffirmed his belief that mainstream historical knowledge is inconsistent.[306][307]\nKasparov wrote How Life Imitates Chess, an examination of the parallels between decision-making in chess and in the business world, in 2007.[308] In 2008, Kasparov published a sympathetic obituary for Fischer: \"I am often asked if I ever met or played Bobby Fischer. The answer is no, I never had that opportunity. But even though he saw me as a member of the evil chess establishment that he felt had robbed and cheated him, I am sorry I never had a chance to thank him personally for what he did for our sport.\"[309]\nKasparov is the chief advisor for the book publisher Everyman Chess.[310] He works closely with Mig Greengard and his comments can often be found on Greengard's blog.[311][312] Kasparov collaborated with Max Levchin and Peter Thiel on The Blueprint, a book calling for a revival of world innovation, planned for release in March 2013 but cancelled after the authors disagreed on its contents.[313] In an editorial comment on Google's AlphaZero chess-playing system, Kasparov argued that chess has become the model for reasoning in the same way that the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster became a model organism for geneticists: \"I was pleased to see that AlphaZero had a dynamic, open style like my own,\" he wrote in late 2018.[314]\nKasparov served as a consultant for the 2020 Netflix miniseries The Queen's Gambit and gave an interview to Slate on his contributions.[315] That same year, Kasparov collaborated with Matt Calkins, founder and CEO of Appian, on HYPERAUTOMATION, a book about low-code development and the future of business automation. Kasparov wrote the foreword where he discusses his experiences with human\u2013machine relationships.[316][317] The New York Times published an essay by Kasparov titled \"Garry Kasparov: What We Believe About Reality\" in 2021.[318] The essay is part of a series called The Big Ideas: What Do We Believe.[319] This work was later published in a compendium titled Question Everything: A Stone Reader.[320]\nKasparov has lived in New York City since 2013.[324][10]\nHe has been married three times: to Masha, with whom he had a daughter, Polina, before divorcing;[325] to Yulia, with whom he had a son, Vadim, before their 2005 divorce;[325] and to Daria (Dasha), with whom he has two children, daughter Aida born in 2006 and son Nickolas born in 2015.[252][10][326] Kasparov's wife manages his business activities worldwide through Kasparov International Management Inc.[327]", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry_Kasparov", "

Wikipedia": {"text": "HarperCollins Publishers LLC is one of the Big Five English-language publishing companies, alongside Penguin Random House, Simon & Schuster, Hachette, and Macmillan. The company is headquartered in New York City and is a subsidiary of News Corp. The name is a combination of several publishing firm names: Harper & Row, an American publishing company acquired in 1987\u2014whose own name was the result of an earlier merger of Harper & Brothers (founded in 1817) and Row, Peterson & Company\u2014together with Scottish publishing company William Collins, Sons (founded in 1819), acquired in 1989.\nThe worldwide CEO of HarperCollins is Brian Murray.[2] HarperCollins has publishing groups in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, India, and China. The company publishes many different imprints, both former independent publishing houses and new imprints.\nCollins was bought by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation in 1989, and was combined with Harper & Row, which NewsCorp had acquired two years earlier. In addition to the simplified and merged name, the logo for HarperCollins was derived from the torch logo for Harper and Row, and the fountain logo for Collins, which were combined into a stylized depiction of flames atop waves.\nIn 1990, HarperCollins sold J. B. Lippincott & Co., its medical publishing division, to the Dutch publisher Wolters Kluwer.[3]\nIn 1996, HarperCollins sold Scott Foresman and HarperCollins College to Pearson, which merged them with Addison-Wesley Longman.[4]\nNews Corporation purchased the Hearst Book Group, consisting of William Morrow & Company and Avon Books, in 1999. These imprints are now published under the rubric of HarperCollins.[5] HarperCollins bought educational publisher Letts and Lonsdale in March 2010.[6]\nIn 2011, HarperCollins announced they had agreed to acquire the publisher Thomas Nelson.[7] The purchase was completed on 11 July 2012, with an announcement that Thomas Nelson would operate independently given the position it has in Christian book publishing.[8] Both Thomas Nelson and Zondervan were then organized as imprints, or \"keystone publishing programs,\" under a new division, HarperCollins Christian Publishing.[9][10] Key roles in the reorganization were awarded to former Thomas Nelson executives.[11]\nIn 2012, HarperCollins acquired part of the trade operations of John Wiley & Son in Canada.[12]\nIn 2014, HarperCollins acquired Canadian romance publisher Harlequin Enterprises for C$455 million.[13]\nIn 2018, HarperCollins acquired the business publisher Amacom from the American Management Association.[14]\nIn 2020, HarperCollins acquired the children's publishers Egmont Books UK, Egmont Poland and Schneiderbuch Germany from the Egmont Group.[15]\nOn 29 March 2021, HarperCollins announced that it would acquire HMH Books & Media, the trade publishing division of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, for $349 million. The deal would allow HMH to pay down its debt and focus on digital education.[16] The deal was completed on 10 May.[17] As of 7 July 2021, HMH's adult books will be published as Mariner Books, while HMH's children's books will be published as Clarion Books.[18]\nIn 2021, HarperCollins acquired the British publishers Pavilion Books.[19]\nIn 2022 HarperCollins acquired Cider Mill Press.[20]\nBrian Murray,[21] the current CEO of HarperCollins, succeeded Jane Friedman who was CEO from 1997 to 2008. Notable management figures include Lisa Sharkey, current senior vice president and director of creative development and Barry Winkleman from 1989 to 1994.\nIn April 2012, the United States Department of Justice filed United States v. Apple Inc., naming Apple, HarperCollins, and four other major publishers as defendants.  The suit alleged that they conspired to fix prices for e-books, and weaken Amazon.com's position in the market, in violation of antitrust law.[22]\nIn December 2013, a federal judge approved a settlement of the antitrust claims, in which HarperCollins and the other publishers paid into a fund that provided credits to customers who had overpaid for books due to the price-fixing.[23]\nOn 5 November 2012, HarperCollins announced to employees privately and then later in the day publicly that it  was closing its remaining two US warehouses,  to merge shipping and warehousing operations with R.\u00a0R. Donnelley in Indiana. The Scranton, Pennsylvania, warehouse closed in September 2013 and a Nashville, Tennessee, warehouse, under the name  Thomas Nelson (which distributes the religious arm of HarperCollins/Zondervan Books), in the winter of 2013. Several office positions and departments continued to work for HarperCollins in Scranton, but in a new location.[24]\nThe Scranton warehouse closing eliminated about 200 jobs, and the Nashville warehouse closing eliminated up to 500 jobs; the exact number of distribution employees is unknown.[25]\nHarperCollins previously closed two US warehouses, one in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, in 2011 and another in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in 2012.[26] \"We have taken a long-term, global view of our print distribution and are committed to offering the broadest possible reach for our authors,\" said HarperCollins Chief Executive Brian Murray, according to Publishers Weekly. \"We are retooling the traditional distribution model to ensure we can competitively offer the entire HarperCollins catalog to customers regardless of location.\" Company officials attribute the closings and mergers to the rapidly growing demand for e-book formats and the decline in print purchasing.[citation needed]\nIn June 2020, HarperCollins was one of a group of publishers who sued the Internet Archive, arguing that its collection of e-books was denying authors and publishers revenue and accusing the library of \"willful mass copyright infringement\".[27]\nIn September 2020, HarperCollins sued Lindsay Lohan for entering into a book deal and collecting a $350,000 advance for a tell-all memoir that never materialized.[28]\nA 2022 book written by Rosemary Sullivan, with HarperCollins as main publisher, designated a Jewish notary as the most likely suspect in Anne Frank's betrayal. The conclusion was challenged by experts. The notary's family members threatened a lawsuit and started a foundation. The Dutch publisher withdrew the book, but HarperCollins has not taken any definitive decision.[29]\nOn 10 November 2022, approximately 250 unionized workers at HarperCollins began an indefinite strike.[30][31] Local 2110 of the United Auto Workers (UAW) union includes people in design, marketing, publicity, and sales for the company. The UAW union made the decision to strike after drawn-out negotiations between it and HarperCollins, which resulted in members \"working without a contract since April.\"[32] According to a spokesperson, HarperCollins \"has agreed to a number of proposals that the UAW is seeking to include in a new contract\" and \"is disappointed an agreement has not been reached\" but \"will continue to negotiate in good faith.\"[30]\nOn 21 December 2022 the local put their in-person picketing on \"pause\" to give strikers an opportunity to spend time with their loved ones.[33][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] The picketing resumed as scheduled on 3 January 2023.[34][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]\nAfter three months of collective action, the union agreed to a new contract with HarperCollins on February 16th 2023.\n[35] \nUnder the new terms, the annual starting pay of HarperCollins employees has increased from $45,000 to $47,500 upon ratification, and is set to rise to $50,000 by 2025. Additionally, full-time employees in the union will receive a lump sum payment of $1,500.[35] The contract also allows workers making less than $60,000 to file for two hours of overtime pay per week without approval from a manager, and puts measures in place to compensate junior-level staff for diversity and inclusion work which is typically unpaid in the industry.[36]\nThe workers returned to their desks on February 21st.[36]\nHarperCollins maintains the backlist of many of the books originally published by its many merged imprints, in addition to having picked up new authors since the merger. Authors published originally by Harper include Mark Twain, the Bront\u00eb sisters, and William Makepeace Thackeray. Authors published originally by Collins include H. G. Wells and Agatha Christie. HarperCollins also acquired the publishing rights to J. R. R. Tolkien's work in 1990 when Unwin Hyman was bought. This is a list of some of the more noted books and series published by HarperCollins and their various imprints and merged publishing houses.\nChildren's book editor Ursula Nordstrom was the director of Harper's Department of Books for Boys and Girls from 1940 to 1973, overseeing the publication of classics such as Goodnight Moon, Where the Wild Things Are, The Giving Tree, Charlotte's Web, Beverly Cleary's series starring Ramona Quimby, and Harold and the Purple Crayon. They were the publishing home of Maurice Sendak, Shel Silverstein, and Margaret Wise Brown.[38] In 1998, Nordstrom's personal correspondence was published as Dear Genius: The Letters of Ursula Nordstrom (illustrated by Maurice Sendak), edited by Charlotte Zolotow. Zolotow began her career as a stenographer to Nordstrom, became her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, and went on to write more than 80 books and edit hundreds of others, including Nordstrom's The Secret Language and the works of Paul Fleischman. Zolotow later became head of the children's books department, and went on to become the company's first female vice president.\nThe Chronicles of Narnia series by C.S. Lewis, while not originally published by a merged imprint of HarperCollins, was acquired by the publisher.[39]\nHarperCollins has published these notable children's books:\nHarperCollins has more than 120 book imprints, most of which are based in the United States.[41] Collins still exists as an imprint, chiefly for wildlife and natural history books, field guides, as well as for English and bilingual dictionaries based on the Bank of English, a large corpus of contemporary English texts.\nHarperCollins imprints (current and defunct, including imprints that existed prior to various mergers) include:\nIn 2008, HarperCollins launched a browsing feature on its website where customers can read selected excerpts from books before purchasing, on both desktop and mobile browsers.[64][65][66] This functionality gave the publisher's website the ability to compete with physical bookstores, in which customers can typically look at the book itself, and Amazon's use of excerpts (\"teasers\") for online book purchasers.[64]\nAt the beginning of October 2013, the company announced a partnership with online digital library Scribd. The official statement revealed that the \"majority\" of the HarperCollins US and HarperCollins Christian catalogs will be available in Scribd's subscription service. Chantal Restivo-Alessi, chief digital officer at HarperCollins, explained to the media that the deal represents the first time that the publisher has released such a large portion of its catalog.[67]\nHarperCollins formerly operated authonomy, an online community of authors, from 2008 to 2015. The website offered an alternative to the traditional \"slush pile\" approach for handling unsolicited manuscripts sent to a publisher with little chance of being reviewed. Using authonomy, authors could submit their work for peer review and ranking by other members; the five highest-ranked manuscripts each month would be read by HarperCollins editors for potential publication. The site was closed after authors \"learned to game the system\" to earn top-five rankings, and fewer authonomy titles were selected to be published.[68]\nFrom 2009 to 2010, HarperCollins operated Bookarmy, a social networking site.\nThe HarperCollins Speakers Bureau (also known as HCSB) is the first lecture agency to be created by a major publishing house.[69] It was launched in May 2005[69] as a division of HarperCollins to book paid speaking engagements for the authors HarperCollins, and its sister companies, publish. Andrea Rosen is the director.[70]\nSome of the notable authors the HCSB represents include Carol Alt, Dennis Lehane, Gregory Maguire,[71] Danny Meyer, Mehmet Oz, Sidney Poitier, Ted Sorensen, and Kate White.\nHarperAcademic is the academic marketing department of HarperCollins.  HarperAcademic provides instructors with the latest in adult titles for course adoption at the high school and college level, as well as titles for first-year and other common read programs at academic institutions.  They also attend several major academic conferences to showcase new titles for academic professionals.\nHarperAcademic Calling, a podcast produced by the department, provides interviews with authors of noteworthy titles.\nHarperCollins announced HarperStudio in 2008 as a \"new, experimental unit... that will eliminate the traditional profit distributions to authors. The long-established author advances and bookseller returns has not proved to be very profitable to either the author or the publisher. The approach HarperStudio is now taking is to offer little or no advance, but instead to split the profit 50% (rather than the industry standard 15%), with the author.\" The division was headed by Bob Miller, previously the founding publisher of Hyperion, the adult books division of the Walt Disney Company.[72][73] HarperStudio folded in March 2010 after Miller left for Workman Publishing.[74]\nHarperCollins Publishers India Pvt Ltd. is a wholly owned subsidiary of HarperCollins Worldwide. It came into being in 1992.\nIf I Did It was a book written by O. J. Simpson about his alleged murder of Nicole Simpson, which was planned as a HarperCollins title, and which attracted considerable controversy and a legal battle over publication.\nIn August 2010, the company became embroiled in a legal battle with the BBC after a book it was due to publish, later identified as the forthcoming autobiography of racing driver Ben Collins, revealed the identity of The Stig from Top Gear.[75] In his blog, Top Gear executive producer Andy Wilman accused HarperCollins of \"hoping to cash in\" on the BBC's intellectual property, describing the publishers as \"a bunch of chancers\".[76] On 1 September, the BBC's request for an injunction preventing the book from being published was turned down, effectively confirming the book's revelation that \"The Stig\" was indeed Collins.[77]\nThe company became embroiled in controversy in 1998 after it was revealed it blocked Chris Patten's (the last British governor of Hong Kong) book East and West after a direct intervention by the then-CEO of News International, Rupert Murdoch.[78] It was later revealed by Stuart Proffitt, the editor who had worked on the book for HarperCollins, that this intervention was designed to appease the Chinese authorities\u2014of whom the book was critical\u2014as Murdoch intended to extend his business empire into China and did not wish to cause problems there by allowing the book to be published.[79]\nMurdoch's intervention caused both Proffitt's resignation from the company and outrage from the international media apart from affiliated companies. Chris Patten later published with Macmillan Publishing, initially in America, where it carried the logo \"The book that Rupert Murdoch refused to publish\".[80] After a successful legal campaign against HarperCollins, Patten went on to publish the book in the UK in September 1998 after accepting a sum of \u00a3500,000 and receiving an apology from Rupert Murdoch.[81]\nIn March 2011, HarperCollins announced it would distribute ebooks to libraries with DRM enabled to delete the item after being lent 26 times.[82][83]  HarperCollins has drawn criticism of this plan, in particular its likening of ebooks, which are purely digital, to traditional paperback trade books, which wear over time.[84][85]\nIn December 2014, The Tablet reported that an atlas published for Middle East schools did not label Israel on a map of the Middle East.[86] A representative for Collins Bartholomew, a subsidiary of HarperCollins that specializes in maps, explained that including Israel would have been \"unacceptable\" to their customers in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf and the omission was in line with \"local preferences\".[87] The company later apologized and destroyed all the books.[88]\nHarperCollins announced in January 2017 that they would discontinue selling copies of Monica Crowley's book What the (Bleep) Just Happened?, due to allegations of plagiarism.[89] The 2012 book had lifted passages from a number of sources including columns, news articles and think tank reports.[89] HarperCollins said in a statement to CNN's KFile, \"The book which has reached the end of its natural sales cycle, will no longer be offered for purchase until such time as the author has the opportunity to source and revise the material.\"[89]", "links":

television news channel Sky News Australia in 2010 for four episodes.\nThe program premiered on 16 November 2010.[1] The program was broadcast live across the country from Sky News' Sydney studio in Macquarie Park and aired Wednesday evenings between 8:15 and 9:00 pm.\nThe program's format consisted of a brief introduction by Hadley followed by an interview with a current federal politician. This was followed by the segment 'thumbs up or thumbs down' where Hadley and one of his guests, usually a journalist, posed pre-written questions to each other where they either agreed or disagreed. The final segment consisted of Hadley and either one of two panellists discussing political and general issues. The show closed with a parody song recorded by the Robertson Brothers.\nHadley resigned from Sky News Australia on the eve of the program's return for 2011.[2] reportedly due to 'differences' and staff not wanting to work with him.[3]", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadley!", " https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bobby_fischer#bodyContent", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page",

Wikipedia": {"text": "Madame Bovary (/\u02c8bo\u028av\u0259ri/;[1] French:\u00a0[madam b\u0254va\u0281i]), originally published as Madame Bovary: Provincial Manners (French: Madame Bovary: M\u0153urs de province [madam b\u0254va\u0281i m\u0153\u0281(s) d\u0259 p\u0281\u0254v\u025b\u0303s]), is a novel by French writer Gustave Flaubert, published in 1856. The eponymous character lives beyond her means in order to escape the banalities and emptiness of provincial life.\nWhen the novel was first serialized in Revue de Paris between 1 October 1856 and 15 December 1856, public prosecutors attacked the novel for obscenity. The resulting trial in January 1857 made the story notorious. After Flaubert's acquittal on 7 February 1857, Madame Bovary became a bestseller in April 1857 when it was published in two volumes. A seminal work of literary realism, the novel is now considered Flaubert's masterpiece, and one of the most influential literary works in history.\nMadame Bovary takes place in provincial Northern France, near the town of Rouen in Normandy. Charles Bovary is a shy, oddly dressed teenager arriving at a new school where his new classmates ridicule him. He struggles his way to a second-rate medical degree, and becomes an Officier de sant\u00e9 in the Public Health Service. He marries the woman his mother has chosen for him, the unpleasant but supposedly rich widow H\u00e9lo\u00efse Dubuc. He sets out to build a practice in the village of T\u00f4tes.\nOne day, Charles visits a local farm to set the owner's broken leg and meets his patient's daughter, Emma Rouault. Emma is a beautiful, poetically dressed young woman who has received a \"good education\" in a convent. She has a powerful yearning for luxury and romance inspired by reading popular novels. Charles is immediately attracted to her, and visits his patient far more often than necessary, until H\u00e9lo\u00efse's jealousy puts a stop to the visits.\nWhen H\u00e9lo\u00efse unexpectedly dies, Charles waits a decent interval before courting Emma in earnest. Her father gives his consent, and Emma and Charles marry.\nThe novel's focus shifts to Emma. After Charles and Emma attend an elegant ball given by the Marquis d'Andervilliers, Emma finds her married life dull and becomes listless. Charles decides his wife needs a change of scenery and moves his practice to the larger market town of Yonville (traditionally identified with the town of Ry). There, Emma gives birth to a daughter, Berthe, but motherhood proves a disappointment to Emma. She becomes infatuated with L\u00e9on Dupuis, an intelligent young man she meets in Yonville. L\u00e9on is a law student who shares Emma's appreciation for literature and music and returns her esteem. Emma does not acknowledge her passion for L\u00e9on, who despairs of gaining Emma's affection and departs for Paris to continue his studies.\nOne day, a rich and rakish landowner, Rodolphe Boulanger, brings a servant to the doctor's office to be bled. He casts his eye over Emma and imagines she will be easily seduced. He invites her to go riding with him for the sake of her health. Charles, solicitous for his wife's health and not at all suspicious, embraces the plan. Emma and Rodolphe begin an affair. She, consumed by her romantic fantasy, risks compromising herself with indiscreet letters and visits to her lover. After four years, she insists they run away together. Rodolphe does not share her enthusiasm for this plan and on the eve of their planned departure, he ends the relationship with a letter placed at the bottom of a basket of apricots delivered to Emma. The shock is so great that Emma falls deathly ill and briefly returns to religion.\nWhen Emma is nearly fully recovered, she and Charles attend the opera, at Charles' insistence, in nearby Rouen. The work being performed that evening was Gaetano Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor, based on Walter Scott's 1819 historical novel The Bride of Lammermoor. The opera reawakens Emma's passions, and she re-encounters L\u00e9on who, now educated and working in Rouen, is also attending the opera. They begin an affair. While Charles believes that she is taking piano lessons, Emma travels to the city each week to meet L\u00e9on, always in the same room of the same hotel, which the two come to view as their home. The love affair is ecstatic at first, but L\u00e9on grows bored with Emma's emotional excesses, and Emma grows ambivalent about L\u00e9on. Emma indulges her fancy for luxury goods and clothes with purchases made on credit from the merchant Lheureux, who arranges for her to obtain power of attorney over Charles' estate. All the same, Emma's debt steadily mounts.\nWhen Lheureux calls in Bovary's debt, Emma pleads for money from several people, including L\u00e9on and Rodolphe, only to be turned down. In despair, she swallows arsenic, purloined from the shop of Homais the apothecary, and dies an agonizing death. Charles, heartbroken, abandons himself to grief, preserves Emma's room as a shrine, and adopts her attitudes and tastes to keep her memory alive. In his last months, he stops working and lives by selling off his possessions. His remaining possessions are seized to pay off Lheureux. When he finds Rodolphe and L\u00e9on's love letters, he breaks down for good. He dies, and his young daughter Berthe is placed with her grandmother, who soon dies. Berthe then lives with an impoverished aunt, who sends her to work in a cotton mill. The book concludes with the local pharmacist Homais, who had competed with Charles' medical practice, gaining prominence among Yonville people and being rewarded for his medical achievements.\nEmma Bovary is the novel's eponymous protagonist (Charles's mother and his former wife are also referred to as Madame Bovary, while their daughter remains Mademoiselle Bovary). She has a highly romanticized view of the world and craves beauty, wealth, passion, as well as high society. It is the disparity between these romantic ideals and the realities of her country life that drive most of the novel, leading her into two affairs and to accrue a sizable debt that eventually leads to her suicide.  She lives a life of the mind, and it is her introspection and analysis of her internal conflicts that marks the psychological growth of Flaubert as an author.\nCharles Bovary, Emma's husband, is a very simple and common man. He is a country doctor by profession but is, as in everything else, not very good at it. He is in fact not qualified enough to be termed a doctor, but is instead an officier de sant\u00e9, or \"health officer\". Yet he is a healthy man who enjoys his work, riding about to attend to patients. He is outgoing and friendly, with a gift for remembering names and faces, and he is mostly called upon to perform first aid. He does this competently enough to earn the loyalty and friendship of his patients in T\u00f4tes; however, when he moves to Yonville to practise medicine there he is sabotaged by the pharmacist Homais. Charles adores his wife and finds her faultless, despite obvious evidence to the contrary. He never suspects her affairs and gives her complete control over his finances, thereby securing his own ruin. Despite Charles's complete devotion to Emma, she despises him, for she finds him the epitome of all that is dull and common.\nRodolphe Boulanger is a wealthy local man who seduces Emma as one more in a long string of mistresses. Though occasionally charmed by Emma, Rodolphe feels little true emotion towards her. As Emma becomes more and more desperate, Rodolphe loses interest and worries about her lack of caution. After his decision to escape with Emma, he resigns and feels unable to handle it, especially the existence of her daughter, Berthe.\nL\u00e9on Dupuis is a clerk who introduces Emma to poetry and who falls in love with her. He leaves Yonville when he despairs of Emma reciprocating his feelings, but the two reconnect after Emma's affair with Rodolphe Boulanger collapses. They begin an affair, which is Emma's second.\nMonsieur Lheureux is a manipulative and sly merchant who continually convinces people in Yonville to buy goods on credit and borrow money from him. Having led many small businesspeople into financial ruin to support his business ambitions, Lheureux lends money to Charles and plays Emma masterfully, leading the Bovarys so far into debt as to cause their financial ruin and Emma's suicide.\nMonsieur Homais is the town pharmacist. He is vehemently anti-clerical and practises medicine without a licence. He is pompous and prone to long-winded speeches on subjects he is ill-informed on. He is not above under-handed tactics or manipulation to achieve his goals.\nJustin is Monsieur Homais' apprentice and second cousin.  He had been taken into the house on charity and was useful at the same time as a servant. He harbors a crush on Emma. At one point he steals the key to the medical supply room, and Emma tricks him into opening a container of arsenic so she can \"kill some rats keeping her awake\". She, however, consumes the arsenic herself, much to his horror and remorse.\nThe setting of the novel is important, first as it applies to Flaubert's realist style and social commentary, and, second, as it relates to the protagonist, Emma.\nFrancis Steegmuller estimated that the novel begins in October 1827 and ends in August 1846. This roughly corresponds with the July Monarchy, the reign of Louis Philippe I, who strolled through Paris carrying his own umbrella as if to honor an ascendant bourgeois middle class. Much of the time and effort that Flaubert spends detailing the customs of the rural French people shows them aping an urban, emergent middle class.\nFlaubert strove for an accurate depiction of common life. The account of a county fair in Yonville displays this and dramatizes it by showing the fair in real time counterpoised with a simultaneous intimate interaction behind a window overlooking the fair. Flaubert knew the regional setting, the place of his birth and youth, in and around the city of Rouen in Normandy. His faithfulness to the mundane elements of country life has garnered the book its reputation as the beginning of the movement known as literary realism.\nFlaubert's capture of the commonplace in his setting contrasts with the yearnings of his protagonist. The practicalities of common life foil Emma's romantic fantasies. Flaubert uses this juxtaposition to reflect both setting and character. Emma becomes more capricious and ludicrous in the light of everyday reality; yet her yearnings magnify the self-important banality of the local people. Emma, though impractical, and with her provincial education lacking and unformed, still reflects a hopefulness regarding beauty and greatness that seems absent in the bourgeois class.\nThe book was in some ways inspired by the life of a schoolfriend of the author who became a doctor. Flaubert's friend and mentor, Louis Bouilhet, had suggested to him that this might be a suitably \"down-to-earth\" subject for a novel and that Flaubert should attempt to write in a \"natural way,\" without digressions.[2] The writing style was of supreme importance to Flaubert. While writing the novel, he wrote that it would be \"a book about nothing, a book dependent on nothing external, which would be held together by the internal strength of its style\",[3] an aim which, for the critic Jean Rousset, made Flaubert \"the first in date of the non-figurative novelists\", such as James Joyce and Virginia Woolf.[4] Though Flaubert avowed no liking for the style of Balzac, the novel he produced became arguably a prime example and an enhancement of literary realism in the vein of Balzac. The \"realism\" in the novel was to prove an important element in the trial for obscenity: the lead prosecutor argued that not only was the novel immoral, but that realism in literature was an offence against art and decency.[5]\nThe realist movement was, in part, a reaction against romanticism. Emma may be said to be the embodiment of a romantic: in her mental and emotional process, she has no relation to the realities of her world. Although in some ways he may seem to identify with Emma,[6] Flaubert frequently mocks her romantic daydreaming and taste in literature. The accuracy of Flaubert's supposed assertion that \"Madame Bovary, c'est moi\" (\"Madame Bovary is me\") has been questioned.[6][7][8] In his letters, he distanced himself from the sentiments in the novel. To Edma Roger des Genettes, he wrote, \"Tout ce que j'aime n'y est pas\" (\"all that I love is not there\") and to Marie-Sophie Leroyer de Chantepie, \"je n'y ai rien mis ni de mes sentiments ni de mon existence\" (\"I have used nothing of my feelings or of my life\").[7] For Mario Vargas Llosa, \"If Emma Bovary had not read all those novels, it is possible that her fate might have been different.\"[9]\nMadame Bovary has been seen as a commentary on the bourgeoisie, the folly of aspirations that can never be realized or a belief in the validity of a self-satisfied, deluded personal culture, associated with Flaubert's period, especially during the reign of Louis Philippe, when the middle class grew to become more identifiable in contrast to the working class and the nobility. Flaubert despised the bourgeoisie. In his Dictionary of Received Ideas, the bourgeoisie is characterized by intellectual and spiritual superficiality, raw ambition, shallow culture, a love of material things, greed, and above all a mindless parroting of sentiments and beliefs.[10]\nFor Vargas Llosa, \"Emma's drama is the gap between illusion and reality, the distance between desire and its fulfillment\" and shows \"the first signs of alienation that a century later will take hold of men and women in industrial societies.\"[11]\nLong established as one of the greatest novels, the book has been described as a \"perfect\" work of fiction. Henry James wrote: \"Madame Bovary has a perfection that not only stamps it, but that makes it stand almost alone: it holds itself with such a supreme unapproachable assurance as both excites and defies judgment.\"[12] Marcel Proust praised the \"grammatical purity\" of Flaubert's style, while Vladimir Nabokov said that \"stylistically it is prose doing what poetry is supposed to do\".[13] Similarly, in his preface to his novel The Joke, Milan Kundera wrote, \"not until the work of Flaubert did prose lose the stigma of aesthetic inferiority. Ever since Madame Bovary, the art of the novel has been considered equal to the art of poetry.\"[14] Giorgio de Chirico said that in his opinion \"from the narrative point of view, the most perfect book is Madame Bovary by Flaubert\".[15] Julian Barnes called it the best novel that has ever been written.[16]\nThe novel exemplifies the tendency of realism, over the course of the nineteenth century, to become increasingly psychological, concerned with the accurate representation of thoughts and emotions rather than of external things.[17] As such it prefigures the work of the great modernist novelists Marcel Proust, Virginia Woolf and James Joyce.\nThe book was controversial upon its release: its scandalous subject matter led to an obscenity trial in 1856. Flaubert was acquitted.[18]\nMadame Bovary has had the following film and television adaptations:\nDavid Lean's film Ryan's Daughter (1970) was a loose adaptation of the story, relocating it to Ireland during the time of the Easter Rebellion.  The script had begun life as a straight adaptation of Madame Bovary, but Lean convinced writer Robert Bolt to re-work it into another setting.", "links":

Wikipedia": {"text": "Selfoss (Icelandic pronunciation:\u00a0\u200b[\u02c8s\u025bl\u02ccf\u0254s\u02d0]) is a town in southern Iceland on the banks of the \u00d6lfus\u00e1 river. It is the seat of the municipality of \u00c1rborg. The Icelandic Route 1 runs through the town on its way between Hverager\u00f0i and Hella. The town is a centre of commerce and small industries with a population of around 10,000 (2023), making it the largest residential area in South Iceland.\nSelfoss was settled by \u00de\u00f3rir \u00c1sason sometime after 1000, but the Sagas of Icelanders mention that Ing\u00f3lfur Arnarson was there during the winter of 873-74, under the Ing\u00f3lfsfjall mountain, which is west of the \u00d6lfus\u00e1 river.\nIn the summer of 1891, due to the lobbying of Tryggvi Gunnarsson, a member of the Al\u00feing, the first suspension bridge was built over the \u00d6lfus\u00e1. That was a major breakthrough in Icelandic infrastructure.  The current bridge was built in 1945 after the original structure collapsed. The cabin built to house workers constructing the bridge is the oldest building in Selfoss, and was named Tryggvask\u00e1li in honor of Tryggvi for his efforts to construct the bridge. After the construction the building was used for travellers' accomodation and dining, until 1974. The building was also the site of Selfoss's first school, telephone exchange and bank. [1]\nThe town of Selfoss developed as a result of the bridge, as the bridge made the town a logical centre for services for the surrounding agricultural region.\nIn 1900, the town was home to only 40 inhabitants, but by 1950 the population had climbed to around 1,000.\nIn 1931, the dairy firm Mj\u00f3lkurb\u00fa Fl\u00f3amanna and general store Kaupf\u00e9lag \u00c1rnesinga were established. The two companies were the main employers in the area for several decades. During World War II the British stationed troops at Selfoss to guard the strategic bridge.\nToday, with more efficient transportation, Selfoss benefits from its proximity to the Reykjav\u00edk area and is predicted to grow further in the coming years as businesses and residents relocate to the town because of lower property prices. This has also led to many relocating their homes from Reykjav\u00edk to the much calmer Selfoss. The population has more than doubled from 2000 to 2020, growing from around 4,500 residents to over 9,000 in 2023. [2]\nIt enjoys low rates of unemployment and is the home of one of the largest colleges in the country; FSU Fj\u00f6lbrautask\u00f3li Su\u00f0urlands.\nIn early August, the town holds a festival called \"Sumar \u00e1 Selfossi\", meaning \"Summer in Selfoss\". Local residents decorate their gardens with ribbons, coloured according to neighbourhood, and a fete is held on the public grassland behind the civic library. The fete involves the selling of homemade goods on small stalls, performances by musicians and magicians on a temporary stage, and in 2011, a \"Strongest Man\" competition was held, with video recording by Icelandic television channel St\u00f6\u00f0 2. In the evening, the revelry continues with a large bonfire and free fireworks display.\nFormer World Chess Champion Bobby Fischer is buried near Selfoss at Laugard\u00e6lir cemetery.[3]\nAccording to the United States Geological Survey, an earthquake with a moment magnitude of 6.3 occurred near Selfoss on the afternoon of Thursday 29 May 2008, causing considerable damage to some buildings and roads.[4][5] The earthquake was felt across southern Iceland, including in the capital Reykjav\u00edk and the airbase at Keflavik. At least 30 people were injured; however, there were no reports of human deaths.[6] A number of sheep in the Selfoss area were killed.[5]\nIn the summer of 2021, a new pedestrianised town center was opened.[7] It consists of reconstructions of historical buildings from all across the country and is located right accross from the bridge, next to the town hall. The largest building is the reconstructed 'Old Dairy' building, a dairy proccessing plant constructed in 1929 and demolished in 1954, now in use as a food hall including a skyr bar. It includes a new town square, shops, restaurants and a food hall. As a result of its success, in 2022 it was decided to expand the project with 40 new houses, including two hotels.[8]\nThe town biggest sports club is the UMF Selfoss multi-sport club, which was founded in 1936. In May 2019, the Selfoss men's handball team won the national handball championship for the first time.[9] In August 2019, the women's football team added the club's second major title in one year when it won the Icelandic Football Cup.[10]\nIts men's football team has played in the Icelandic leagues since 1966. The team spent two seasons in the top-tier \u00darvalsdeild, in 2010 and 2012, but were relegated in both seasons.\nThe town also has a basketball club named K\u00f6rfuknattleiksf\u00e9lag Selfoss. Its men's team has had spells in the top-tier \u00darvalsdeild karla. Part of the local college and the club serve as a development academy for young players that attend the school.\nSelfoss sits on Route 1, the Icelandic ring road, and is the first major stop east of Reykjavik. The bridge over the \u00d6lfus\u00e1 river, called \u00d6lfus\u00e1rbr\u00fa, is an important link in southern Iceland, and the genisis of the town's location. The original bridge was constructed in 1891 but collapsed when a milk truck traversed the bridge in 1944. The current \u00d6lfus\u00e1 bridge was opened a year later in December 1945.\nHeavy summer traffic is a problem during the summer in Selfoss. The \u00d6lfus\u00e1 bridge is only a two lane bridge and traffic is routed through the town centre. It carries practically all of the traffic to the south of the country, a significant bottleneck. This is planned to be replaced by a new bypass road just north of the town and new 4-lane bridge over the \u00d6lfus river, with current plans seeing it complete by 2026.[11]\nStr\u00e6t\u00f3 bs. operates multiple daily buses (bus numbers 51 and 52) to and from Reykjav\u00edk, as well as buses headed towards H\u00f6fn and Landeyjarh\u00f6fn (for Vestmannaeyjar) in the east. There are also a limited service (bus numbers 72 and 73) to south Iceland desinations such as Laugarvatn, Reykholt and Fl\u00fa\u00f0ir.\nSelfoss Airport is a privately run airstrip located just to the southwest of the town.\nSelfoss is located about 11\u00a0km inland from the southwestern coast of Iceland, and 50\u00a0km from Reykjav\u00edk. It is the major town and the administrative seat of the Southern Region. The closest other towns are Eyrarbakki, Stokkseyri and Hverager\u00f0i.\nSimilar to the rest of the southern coast of Iceland, Selfoss has a subpolar oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfc) with cool summers and cold winters, although relatively mild for its high latitude. Precipitation is abundant year round, with October usually seeing the most precipitation.", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfoss_(town)", "
