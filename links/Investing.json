{"Investing": {"text": "Investing differs from trading in that investing is for the long-term, usually years or decades. Investing is one of the key strategies to building long-term wealth and financial security.\nYes, many brokerages have no minimum account size and will offer zero-commission trading, allowing you to begin investing with even very small amounts. In fact, now with many brokers offering fractional shares, you can invest in stocks even if their share price is over $1000.\nWhile there are many ways to invest in stocks, one of the easiest and best ways for beginning investors to do so is to open up a retirement account with a discount broker. These accounts have tax advantages when saving for retirement and many different brokers have ones that cost little or even nothing to have.\nWhile you can\u2019t invest with zero money, you can invest with very little. Many stock brokers offer accounts with no minimum balance and no trading commissions so almost any amount you add to your account can be used to invest.\nYou should invest because investing allows your savings to go farther than they otherwise would. Simply holding your savings as cash means it will just sit and be slowly diluted by inflation, whereas even in the safest investments it will earn some money for you, building on itself.\nAs soon as you can afford to. Because investment returns compound, that is, the money you earn from investing then earns money, the sooner you begin investing, the more time you give for this process to work.\nIn the U.S. stock markets major exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq are open from 9:30 .a.m to 4.p.m Eastern Time. However, this varies around the world depending on what exchange you\u2019re looking at and whether that day is a holiday.\nA bond is an investment representing part or all of a loan to a person, government, or other entity. Bonds are issued at a set par value, usually $1000 or $100, and their prices fluctuates based on interest rates and perceived credit-worthiness of the borrower.\nA bond\u2019s yield is the investment return that an investor will gain from a bond, usually expressed as a percentage. This is the percent of the bond\u2019s price that each set interest payment will be. Yields go up as a bond\u2019s price goes down and vice versa because they are a percent of the bond\u2019s value, therefore the higher the bond\u2019s price, the lower a percentage of that value a set interest payment will be.\nTechnical analysis is a form of stock analysis that involves looking at the price movements of stocks over time in order to predict where they will go. It attempts to find patterns in stock movements based on statistical trends such as the moving average of a stock or its trading volume. This contrasts with fundamental analysis which looks at the financial values of the business that issued the stock and economic conditions affecting the market and that business in order to assess where a stock\u2019s price will go.\nA sector breakdown is a way to look at a portfolio by organizing it by which sector of the economy each stock is in. This allows an investor to, depending on their investing strategy, avoid stocks from companies in sectors they don\u2019t believe to have strong prospects, focus on stocks from sectors they believe are in a good position for growth, or ensure their portfolio is diversified.\nShort term investments are investments that are designed to be held for a year or less or investments a company intends to sell within 12 months. They are also known as \u201cmarketable securities\u201d or \u201ctemporary investments,\u201d and can be easily sold for cash.\nAn investment banker works for a bank that deals mostly with raising capital for large institutions such as governments and corporations. They also deal with corporate restructuring as well as corporate mergers & acquisition (M&A).\nWall Street is a street in New York City which, due to having been a historical center of the U.S. financial industry, is used as a term to refer to that industry as a whole. It is often contrasted to Main Street, which is used as a term to represent the broader economy outside the financial industry, especially small businesses.", "links":

Investing Essentials": {"text": "From online brokerages increasing the ease of trading to mobile banking lowering the barriers for consumers to have access to the banking system, fintech has brought many advantages for consumers.\nFintech is a portmanteau of the words \u201cfinancial\u201d and \u201ctechnology,\u201d and refers to technologies used in the financial sector of the economy. This includes things such as online banking apps, online stock brokerages, and mobile payment apps.\nMoore\u2019s law is a name given to a prediction by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore that the number of transistors that could be put on a computer chip would roughly double every 2 years. This trend held true for several decades after it was made in the 1960\u2019s, and the exponential increase in transistor density has continued, albeit, not at the same rate.\nQuantum computing is a field of computing that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to change the way computers store and process information. Specifically, instead of data being stored as bits, which are individual units of binary code, they would be stored as Qubits (a portmanteau of \u201cquantum\u201d and \u201cbits\u201d). Qubits would be able to be in a quantum superposition of being both 0 or 1, which would allow significantly great processing capability.\nOpen banking, is a practice that involves the sharing of financial data between financial service providers through the use of application programming interfaces (APIs). This practice could potentially open up new options to consumers and/or significantly compromise individuals' data security and privacy.\nCost per click (CPC) is a model that some websites use to bill advertisers who advertise on their sites. It charges advertisers a certain amount, the aforementioned CPC, per time a visitor to the website clicks on the ad displayed there. Some sites use a different model which charges advertisers per certain number of people, usually 1000, who see an ad. That model is called \u201ccost per mile.\u201d\nMobile commerce, also known as m-commerce, is the use of smartphones, cell phones, and similar mobile devices to make commercial transactions. This can include purchasing items or paying bills.\nInsurtech is a portmanteau of \u201cinsurance\u201d and \u201ctechnology,\u201d and refers to the technology used by the insurance industry. Examples include mobile apps through which people can purchase insurance.\nA quick response (QR) code is a kind of barcode that can be read easily by a computer. It stores information in a square-shaped grid, rather than a series of lines like a conventional barcode.\nMaterial requirements planning (MRP) is an inventory management system that uses software to keep track of and manage a business\u2019s inventory and supply chain. It requires significant initial costs and high-quality data, but can increase supply chain efficiency if those requirements are met.\nMobile banking is when banking services are used via mobile devices such as smartphones.\nGPUs are a particular type of computer chip that is specialized at creating computer graphics. They were traditionally used to allow computers to play games and do 3D art and design. However, the kind of mathematics involved in computer graphics is of a similar type to the kind used to mind Bitcoin and train AIs, so the demand for GPUs has risen substantially in recent years as new uses have emerged.", "links": ["https://www.investopedia.com/financial-technology-and-automated-investing-4689759", "https://en.wikipedia.org/", "https://www.investopedia.com/investing-4427685",

strategist.\nKatrina \u00c1vila Munichiello is an experienced editor, writer, fact-checker, and proofreader with more than fourteen years of experience working with print and online publications.\nThe Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) was a U.S. development finance institution. This government agency assisted private businesses that wanted to invest abroad. OPIC encouraged development in emerging markets through private sector investment overseas by assisting corporations to analyze and manage risks while encouraging development in emerging markets. This helped the agency advance the country's foreign policy and national security goals.\nOPIC was consolidated with the U.S. Agency for International Development's (USAID) Development Credit Authority to form the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation in 2019.\nThe Overseas Private Investment Corporation was established in 1971 as a U.S. government agency under then-President Richard Nixon. It was the country's one-and-only development finance institution (DFI) and was based in Washington, D.C. DFIs are government-owned organizations that invest in private sector projects and promote national interests.\nAs the country's DFI, OPIC helped private sector investment abroad. OPIC-backed projects were reinforced and aligned with U.S. foreign policy. They fostered economic and political stability, along with free-market ideals, especially in conflict-ridden areas.\nIts initial portfolio included political risk insurance worth $8.4 billion along with $169 million in loan guarantees. That portfolio expanded to more than $20 billion, reaching out to more than 160 different developing countries. Direct loans and guarantees ranged from a few million to $350 million for up to 20 years in underserved areas without easy access to commercial financing.\nFunding was only provided to companies with a sound business model, for which it charged market-based fees. This allowed the agency to operate without the need for any taxpayer assistance. The agency reported that it actually generated money for American taxpayers, contributing as much as $3.7 billion toward reducing the national deficit between 2006 and 2016.\nAccording to OPIC's operating statute, the projects it helped could not cause job loss in the United States.\nAs mentioned above, OPIC was consolidated with USAID\u2019s Development Credit Authority to form the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) in 2019. The merger was realized after the passing of the Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development Act was passed on Oct. 5, 2018. The new entity allows the use of newer and more innovative financial products to help distribute private capital to developing economies.\nJust like its predecessor, DFC aims to advance the interests of American foreign policy and national security as the private sector helps the development of emerging market economies. It accomplishes this through political risk insurance and debt financing, comprising of direct loans and guarantees of up to $1 billion for up to 25 years. It also provides:\nThe DFC allows private sector investment in several sectors, including energy, health care, critical infrastructure, technology. Businesses are required to meet specific standards and have an established history in their specific industries.\nU.S. International Development Finance Corporation. \"Overview.\" Accessed April 27,
