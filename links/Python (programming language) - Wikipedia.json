{"Python (programming language) - Wikipedia": {"text": "Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation via the off-side rule.[33]\nPython is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a \"batteries included\" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[34][35]\nGuido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python\u00a00.9.0.[36] Python\u00a02.0 was released in 2000. Python\u00a03.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python\u00a02.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python\u00a02.[37]\nPython consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.[38][39][40][41]\nPython was conceived in the late 1980s[42] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[43] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[13] Its implementation began in December\u00a01989.[44] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his \"permanent vacation\" from his responsibilities as Python's \"benevolent dictator for life\", a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker.[45] In January\u00a02019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.[46][47]\nPython\u00a02.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support.[48] Python\u00a03.0, released on 3 December 2008, with many of its major features backported to Python\u00a02.6.x[49] and 2.7.x. Releases of Python\u00a03 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python\u00a02 code to Python\u00a03.[50]\nPython\u00a02.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python\u00a03.[51][52] No further security patches or other improvements will be released for it.[53][54] Currently only 3.7 and later are supported. In 2021, Python\u00a03.9.2 and 3.8.8 were expedited[55] as all versions of Python (including 2.7[56]) had security issues leading to possible remote code execution[57] and web cache poisoning.[58]\nIn 2022, Python\u00a03.10.4 and 3.9.12 were expedited[59] and 3.8.13, and 3.7.13, because of many security issues.[60] When Python\u00a03.9.13 was released in May 2022, it was announced that the 3.9 series (joining the older series 3.8 and 3.7) would only receive security fixes in the future.[61] On September 7, 2022, four new releases were made due to a potential denial-of-service attack: 3.10.7, 3.9.14, 3.8.14, and 3.7.14.[62][63]\nAs of November\u00a02022,[update] Python\u00a03.11 is the stable release. Notable changes from 3.10 include increased program execution speed and improved error reporting.[64]\nPython is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of their features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including metaprogramming[65] and metaobjects).[66] Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract[67][68] and logic programming.[69]\nPython uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management.[70] It uses dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.\nIts design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. It has filter,mapandreduce functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions.[71] The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.[72]\nIts core philosophy is summarized in the document The Zen of Python (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such as:[73]\nRather than building all of its functionality into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible via modules. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum's vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC, which espoused the opposite approach.[42]\nPython strives for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. In contrast to Perl's \"there is more than one way to do it\" motto, Python embraces a \"there should be one\u2014and preferably only one\u2014obvious way to do it\"  philosophy.[73] Alex Martelli, a Fellow at the Python Software Foundation and Python book author, wrote: \"To describe something as 'clever' is not considered a compliment in the Python culture.\"[74]\nPython's developers strive to avoid premature optimization and reject patches to non-critical parts of the CPython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity.[75] When speed is important, a Python programmer can move time-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C; or use PyPy, a just-in-time compiler. Cython is also available, which translates a Python script into C and makes direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter.\nPython's developers aim for it to be fun to use. This is reflected in its name\u2014a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python[76]\u2014and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as the use of the terms \"spam\" and \"eggs\" (a reference to a Monty Python sketch) in examples, instead of the often-used \"foo\" and \"bar\".[77][78]\nA common neologism in the Python community is pythonic, which has a wide range of meanings related to program style. \"Pythonic\" code may use Python idioms well, be natural or show fluency in the language, or conform with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. Code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic.[79][80]\nPython is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered and often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but rarely used. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.[81]\nPython uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block.[82] Thus, the program's visual structure accurately represents its semantic structure.[83] This feature is sometimes termed the off-side rule. Some other languages use indentation this way; but in most, indentation has no semantic meaning. The recommended indent size is four spaces.[84]\nPython's statements include:\nThe assignment statement (=) binds a name as a reference to a separate, dynamically allocated object. Variables may subsequently be rebound at any time to any object. In Python, a variable name is a generic reference holder without a fixed data type; however, it always refers to some object with a type. This is called dynamic typing\u2014in contrast to statically-typed languages, where each variable may contain only a value of a certain type.\nPython does not support tail call optimization or first-class continuations, and, according to Van Rossum, it never will.[87][88] However, better support for coroutine-like functionality is provided by extending Python's generators.[89] Before 2.5, generators were lazy iterators; data was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python\u00a02.5 on, it is possible to pass data back into a generator function; and from version 3.3, it can be passed through multiple stack levels.[90]\nPython's expressions include:\nIn Python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such as Common Lisp, Scheme, or Ruby. This leads to duplicating some functionality. For example:\nStatements cannot be a part of an expression\u2014so list and other comprehensions or lambda expressions, all being expressions, cannot contain statements. A particular case is that an assignment statement such as a = 1 cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement. This has the advantage of avoiding a classic C error of mistaking an assignment operator = for an equality operator == in conditions: if (c = 1) { ...} is syntactically valid (but probably unintended) C code, but if c = 1: ... causes a syntax error in Python.\nMethods on objects are functions attached to the object's class; the syntax instance.method(argument) is, for normal methods and functions, syntactic sugar for Class.method(instance, argument). Python methods have an explicit self parameter to access instance data, in contrast to the implicit self (or this) in some other object-oriented programming languages (e.g., C++, Java, Objective-C, Ruby).[99] Python also provides methods, often called dunder methods (due to their names beginning and ending with double-underscores), to allow user-defined classes to modify how they are handled by native operations including length, comparison, in arithmetic operations and type conversion.[100]\nPython uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names. Type constraints are not checked at compile time; rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that it is not of a suitable type. Despite being dynamically typed, Python is strongly typed, forbidding operations that are not well-defined (for example, adding a number to a string) rather than silently attempting to make sense of them.\nPython allows programmers to define their own types using classes, most often used for object-oriented programming. New instances of classes are constructed by calling the class (for example, SpamClass() or EggsClass()), and the classes are instances of the metaclass type (itself an instance of itself), allowing metaprogramming and reflection.\nBefore version\u00a03.0, Python had two kinds of classes (both using the same syntax): old-style and new-style,[101] current Python versions only support the semantics new style.\nPython supports gradual typing.[102] Python's syntax allows specifying static types, but they are not checked in the default implementation, CPython. An experimental optional static type-checker, mypy, supports compile-time type checking.[103]\n1.33333\nPython has the usual symbols for arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), the floor division operator // and the modulo operation % (where the remainder can be negative,  e.g. 4\u00a0% -3 == -2). It also has ** for exponentiation, e.g. 5**3 == 125 and 9**0.5 == 3.0, and a matrix\u2011multiplication operator @ .[107] These operators work like in traditional math; with the same precedence rules, the operators infix (+ and - can also be unary to represent positive and negative numbers respectively).\nThe division between integers produces floating-point results. The behavior of division has changed significantly over time:[108]\nIn Python terms, / is true division (or simply division), and // is floor division. / before version 3.0 is classic division.[108]\nRounding towards negative infinity, though different from most languages, adds consistency. For instance, it means that the equation (a + b)//b == a//b + 1 is always true. It also means that the equation b*(a//b) + a%b == a is valid for both positive and negative values of a. However, maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result of a%b is, as expected, in the half-open interval [0, b), where b is a positive integer, it has to lie in the interval (b, 0] when b is negative.[109]\nPython provides a round function for rounding a float to the nearest integer. For tie-breaking, Python\u00a03 uses round to even: round(1.5) and round(2.5) both produce 2.[110] Versions before 3 used round-away-from-zero: round(0.5) is 1.0, round(-0.5) is \u22121.0.[111]\nPython allows boolean expressions with multiple equality relations in a manner that is consistent with general use in mathematics. For example, the expression a < b < c tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c.[112] C-derived languages interpret this expression differently: in C, the expression would first evaluate a < b, resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with c.[113]\nPython uses arbitrary-precision arithmetic for all integer operations. The Decimal type/class in the decimal module provides decimal floating-point numbers to a pre-defined arbitrary precision and several rounding modes.[114] The Fraction class in the fractions module provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers.[115]\nDue to Python's extensive mathematics library, and the third-party library NumPy that further extends the native capabilities, it is frequently used as a scientific scripting language to aid in problems such as numerical data processing and manipulation.[116][117]\nHello world program:\nProgram to calculate the factorial of a positive integer:\nPython's large standard library[118] provides tools suited to many tasks and is commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths. For Internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as MIME and HTTP are supported. It includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary-precision decimals,[119] manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing.\nSome parts of the standard library are covered by specifications\u2014for example, the Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) implementation wsgiref follows PEP 333[120]\u2014but most are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites. However, because most of the standard library is cross-platform Python code, only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant implementations.\nAs of 14\u00a0November\u00a02022,[update] the Python Package Index (PyPI), the official repository for third-party Python software, contains over 415,000[121] packages with a wide range of functionality, including:\nMost Python implementations (including CPython) include a read\u2013eval\u2013print loop (REPL), permitting them to function as a command line interpreter for which users enter statements sequentially and receive results immediately.\nPython also comes with an Integrated development environment (IDE) called IDLE, which is more beginner-oriented.\nOther shells, including IDLE and IPython, add further abilities such as improved auto-completion, session state retention, and syntax highlighting.\nAs well as standard desktop integrated development environments, there are Web browser-based IDEs, including SageMath, for developing science- and math-related programs; PythonAnywhere, a browser-based IDE and hosting environment; and Canopy IDE, a commercial IDE emphasizing scientific computing.[122]\nCPython is the reference implementation of Python. It is written in C, meeting the C89 standard (Python 3.11 uses C11[123]) with several select C99 features. CPython includes its own C extensions, but third-party extensions are not limited to older C versions\u2014e.g. they can be implemented with C11 or C++.[124][125]) It compiles Python programs into an intermediate bytecode[126] which is then executed by its virtual machine.[127] CPython is distributed with a large standard library written in a mixture of C and native Python, and is available for many platforms, including Windows (starting with Python\u00a03.9, the Python installer deliberately fails to install on Windows 7 and 8;[128][129] Windows XP was supported until Python\u00a03.5) and most modern Unix-like systems, including macOS (and Apple M1 Macs, since Python\u00a03.9.1, with experimental installer) and unofficial support for e.g. VMS.[130] Platform portability was one of its earliest priorities.[131] (During Python\u00a01 and 2 development, even OS/2 and Solaris were supported,[132] but support has since been dropped for many platforms.)\nOther just-in-time Python compilers have been developed, but are now unsupported:\nThere are several compilers to high-level object languages, with either unrestricted Python, a restricted subset of Python, or a language similar to Python as the source language:\nSpecialized:\nOlder projects (or not to be used with Python 3.x and latest syntax):\nPerformance comparison of various Python implementations on a non-numerical (combinatorial) workload was presented at EuroSciPy '13.[156] Python's performance compared to other programming languages is also benchmarked by The Computer Language Benchmarks Game.[157]\nPython's development is conducted largely through the Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) process, the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting community input on issues, and documenting Python design decisions.[158] Python coding style is covered in PEP\u00a08.[159] Outstanding PEPs are reviewed and commented on by the Python community and the steering council.[158]\nEnhancement of the language corresponds with the development of the CPython reference implementation. The mailing list python-dev is the primary forum for the language's development. Specific issues were originally discussed in the Roundup bug tracker hosted at by the foundation.[160] In 2022, all issues and discussions were migrated to GitHub.[161] Development originally took place on a self-hosted source-code repository running Mercurial, until Python moved to GitHub in January 2017.[162]\nCPython's public releases come in three types, distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented:\nMany alpha, beta, and release-candidates are also released as previews and for testing before final releases. Although there is a rough schedule for each release, they are often delayed if the code is not ready. Python's development team monitors the state of the code by running the large unit test suite during development.[168]\nThe major academic conference on Python is PyCon. There are also special Python mentoring programs, such as Pyladies.\nPython\u00a03.10 deprecated wstr (to be removed in Python\u00a03.12; meaning Python extensions[169] need to be modified by then),[170] and added pattern matching to the language.[171]\nTools that can generate documentation for Python API include pydoc (available as part of the standard library), Sphinx, Pdoc and its forks, Doxygen and Graphviz, among others.[172]\nPython's name is derived from the British comedy group Monty Python, whom Python creator Guido van Rossum enjoyed while developing the language. Monty Python references appear frequently in Python code and culture;[173] for example, the metasyntactic variables often used in Python literature are spam and eggs instead of the traditional foo and bar.[173][174] The official Python documentation also contains various references to Monty Python routines.[175][176]\nThe prefix Py- is used to show that something is related to Python. Examples of the use of this prefix in names of Python applications or libraries include Pygame, a binding of SDL to Python (commonly used to create games); PyQt and PyGTK, which bind Qt and GTK to Python respectively; and PyPy, a Python implementation originally written in Python.\nSince 2003, Python has consistently ranked in the top ten most popular programming languages in the TIOBE Programming Community Index where as of December\u00a02022[update] it was the most popular language (ahead of C, C++, and Java).[40] It was selected Programming Language of the Year (for \"the highest rise in ratings in a year\") in 2007, 2010, 2018, and 2020 (the only language to have done so four times as of 2020[177]).\nAn empirical study found that scripting languages, such as Python, are more productive than conventional languages, such as C and Java, for programming problems involving string manipulation and search in a dictionary, and determined that memory consumption was often \"better than Java and not much worse than C or C++\".[178]\nLarge organizations that use Python include Wikipedia, Google,[179] Yahoo!,[180] CERN,[181] NASA,[182] Facebook,[183] Amazon, Instagram,[184] Spotify,[185] and some smaller entities like ILM[186] and ITA.[187] The social news networking site Reddit was written mostly in Python.[188]\nPython can serve as a scripting language for web applications, e.g., via mod_wsgi for the Apache webserver.[189] With Web Server Gateway Interface, a standard API has evolved to facilitate these applications. Web frameworks like Django, Pylons, Pyramid, TurboGears, web2py, Tornado, Flask, Bottle, and Zope support developers in the design and maintenance of complex applications. Pyjs and IronPython can be used to develop the client-side of Ajax-based applications. SQLAlchemy can be used as a data mapper to a relational database. Twisted is a framework to program communications between computers, and is used (for example) by Dropbox.\nLibraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib allow the effective use of Python in scientific computing,[190][191] with specialized libraries such as Biopython and Astropy providing domain-specific functionality. SageMath is a computer algebra system with a notebook interface programmable in Python: its library covers many aspects of mathematics, including algebra, combinatorics, numerical mathematics, number theory, and calculus.[192] OpenCV has Python bindings with a rich set of features for computer vision and image processing.[193]\nPython is commonly used in artificial intelligence projects and machine learning projects with the help of libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, Pytorch, and scikit-learn.[194][195][196][197] As a scripting language with a modular architecture, simple syntax, and rich text processing tools, Python is often used for natural language processing.[198]\nPython can also be used to create games, with libraries such as Pygame, which can make 2D games.\nPython has been successfully embedded in many software products as a scripting language, including in finite element method software such as Abaqus, 3D parametric modelers like FreeCAD, 3D animation packages such as 3ds Max, Blender, Cinema 4D, Lightwave, Houdini, Maya, modo, MotionBuilder, Softimage, the visual effects compositor Nuke, 2D imaging programs like GIMP,[199] Inkscape, Scribus and Paint Shop Pro,[200] and musical notation programs like scorewriter and capella. GNU Debugger uses Python as a pretty printer to show complex structures such as C++ containers. Esri promotes Python as the best choice for writing scripts in ArcGIS.[201] It has also been used in several video games,[202][203] and has been adopted as first of the three available programming languages in Google App Engine, the other two being Java and Go.[204]\nMany operating systems include Python as a standard component. It ships with most Linux distributions,[205] AmigaOS 4 (using Python\u00a02.7), FreeBSD (as a package), NetBSD, and OpenBSD (as a package) and can be used from the command line (terminal). Many Linux distributions use installers written in Python: Ubuntu uses the Ubiquity installer, while Red Hat Linux and Fedora Linux use the Anaconda installer. Gentoo Linux uses Python in its package management system, Portage.\nPython is used extensively in the information security industry, including in exploit development.[206][207]\nMost of the Sugar software for the One Laptop per Child XO, developed at Sugar Labs since 2008, is written in Python.[208] The Raspberry Pi single-board computer project has adopted Python as its main user-programming language.\nLibreOffice includes Python and intends to replace Java with Python. Its Python Scripting Provider is a core feature[209] since Version 4.0 from 7 February 2013.\nPython's design and philosophy have influenced many other programming languages:\nPython's development practices have also been emulated by other languages. For example, the practice of requiring a document describing the rationale for, and issues surrounding, a change to the language (in Python, a PEP) is also used in Tcl,[219] Erlang,[220] and Swift.[221]", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)", " https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/python_(programming_language)#bodyContent",

Wikipedia": {"text": "Numerical analysis is the study of algorithms that use numerical approximation (as opposed to symbolic manipulations) for the problems of mathematical analysis (as distinguished from discrete mathematics). It is the study of numerical methods that attempt at finding approximate solutions of problems rather than the exact ones. Numerical analysis finds application in all fields of engineering and the physical sciences, and in the 21st century also the life and social sciences, medicine, business and even the arts. Current growth in computing power has enabled the use of more complex numerical analysis, providing detailed and realistic mathematical models in science and engineering. Examples of numerical analysis include: ordinary differential equations as found in celestial mechanics (predicting the motions of planets, stars and galaxies), numerical linear algebra in data analysis,[2][3][4] and stochastic differential equations and Markov chains for simulating living cells in medicine and biology.\nBefore modern computers, numerical methods often relied on hand interpolation formulas, using data from large printed tables. Since the mid 20th century, computers calculate the required functions instead, but many of the same formulas continue to be used in software algorithms.[5]\nThe numerical point of view goes back to the earliest mathematical writings. A tablet from the Yale Babylonian Collection (YBC 7289), gives a sexagesimal numerical approximation of the square root of 2, the length of the diagonal in a unit square.\nNumerical analysis continues this long tradition: rather than giving exact symbolic answers translated into digits and applicable only to real-world measurements, approximate solutions within specified error bounds are used.\nThe overall goal of the field of numerical analysis is the design and analysis of techniques to give approximate but accurate solutions to hard problems, the variety of which is suggested by the following:\nThe rest of this section outlines several important themes of numerical analysis.\nThe field of numerical analysis predates the invention of modern computers by many centuries. Linear interpolation was already in use more than 2000 years ago. Many great mathematicians of the past were preoccupied by numerical analysis,[5] as is obvious from the names of important algorithms like Newton's method, Lagrange interpolation polynomial, Gaussian elimination, or Euler's method. The origins of modern numerical analysis are often linked to a 1947 paper by John von Neumann and Herman Goldstine,[6][7][8]\nbut others consider modern numerical analysis to go back to work by E. T. Whittaker in 1912.[6]\nTo facilitate computations by hand, large books were produced with formulas and tables of data such as interpolation points and function coefficients. Using these tables, often calculated out to 16 decimal places or more for some functions, one could look up values to plug into the formulas given and achieve very good numerical estimates of some functions. The canonical work in the field is the NIST publication edited by Abramowitz and Stegun, a 1000-plus page book of a very large number of commonly used formulas and functions and their values at many points. The function values are no longer very useful when a computer is available, but the large listing of formulas can still be very handy.\nThe mechanical calculator was also developed as a tool for hand computation. These calculators evolved into electronic computers in the 1940s, and it was then found that these computers were also useful for administrative purposes. But the invention of the computer also influenced the field of numerical analysis,[5] since now longer and more complicated calculations could be done.\nThe Leslie Fox Prize for Numerical Analysis was initiated in 1985 by the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications.\nConsider the problem of solving\nfor the unknown quantity x.\nFor the iterative method, apply the bisection method to f(x) = 3x3 \u2212 24. The initial values are a = 0, b = 3, f(a) = \u221224, f(b) = 57.\nFrom this table it can be concluded that the solution is between 1.875 and 2.0625. The algorithm might return any number in that range with an error less than 0.2.\nIn a two-hour race, the speed of the car is measured at three instants and recorded in the following table.\nA discretization would be to say that the speed of the car was constant from 0:00 to 0:40, then from 0:40 to 1:20 and finally from 1:20 to 2:00. For instance, the total distance traveled in the first 40 minutes is approximately (2/3\u00a0h\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0140\u00a0km/h)\u00a0=\u00a093.3\u00a0km. This would allow us to estimate the total distance traveled as 93.3\u00a0km + 100\u00a0km + 120\u00a0km = 313.3\u00a0km, which is an example of numerical integration (see below) using a Riemann sum, because displacement is the integral of velocity.\nIll-conditioned problem: Take the function f(x) = 1/(x\u00a0\u2212\u00a01). Note that f(1.1) = 10 and f(1.001) = 1000: a change in x of less than 0.1 turns into a change in f(x) of nearly 1000. Evaluating f(x) near x = 1 is an ill-conditioned problem.\nWell-conditioned problem: By contrast, evaluating the same function f(x) = 1/(x\u00a0\u2212\u00a01) near x = 10 is a well-conditioned problem. For instance, f(10) = 1/9 \u2248 0.111 and f(11) = 0.1: a modest change in x leads to a modest change in f(x).\nDirect methods compute the solution to a problem in a finite number of steps. These methods would give the precise answer if they were performed in infinite precision arithmetic. Examples include Gaussian elimination, the QR factorization method for solving systems of linear equations, and the simplex method of linear programming. In practice, finite precision is used and the result is an approximation of the true solution (assuming stability).\nIn contrast to direct methods, iterative methods are not expected to terminate in a finite number of steps. Starting from an initial guess, iterative methods form successive approximations that converge to the exact solution only in the limit. A convergence test, often involving the residual, is specified in order to decide when a sufficiently accurate solution has (hopefully) been found. Even using infinite precision arithmetic these methods would not reach the solution within a finite number of steps (in general). Examples include Newton's method, the bisection method, and Jacobi iteration. In computational matrix algebra, iterative methods are generally needed for large problems.[9][10][11][12]\nIterative methods are more common than direct methods in numerical analysis. Some methods are direct in principle but are usually used as though they were not, e.g. GMRES and the conjugate gradient method. For these methods the number of steps needed to obtain the exact solution is so large that an approximation is accepted in the same manner as for an iterative method.\nFurthermore, continuous problems must sometimes be replaced by a discrete problem whose solution is known to approximate that of the continuous problem; this process is called 'discretization'. For example, the solution of a differential equation is a function. This function must be represented by a finite amount of data, for instance by its value at a finite number of points at its domain, even though this domain is a continuum.\nThe study of errors forms an important part of numerical analysis. There are several ways in which error can be introduced in the solution of the problem.\nRound-off errors arise because it is impossible to represent all real numbers exactly on a machine with finite memory (which is what all practical digital computers are).\nTruncation errors are committed when an iterative method is terminated or a mathematical procedure is approximated and the approximate solution differs from the exact solution. Similarly, discretization induces a discretization error because the solution of the discrete problem does not coincide with the solution of the continuous problem. In the example above to compute the solution of \n\n\n\n3\n\nx\n\n3\n\n\n+\n4\n=\n28\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 3x^{3}+4=28}\n\n, after ten iterations, the calculated root is roughly 1.99. Therefore, the truncation error is roughly 0.01.\nOnce an error is generated, it propagates through the calculation. For example, the operation + on a computer is inexact. A calculation of the type \n\n\n\na\n+\nb\n+\nc\n+\nd\n+\ne\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a+b+c+d+e}\n\n is even more inexact.\nA truncation error is created when a mathematical procedure is approximated. To integrate a function exactly, an infinite sum of regions must be found, but numerically only a finite sum of regions can be found, and hence the approximation of the exact solution. Similarly, to differentiate a function, the differential element approaches zero, but numerically only a nonzero value of the differential element can be chosen.\nNumerical stability is a notion in numerical analysis. An algorithm is called 'numerically stable' if an error, whatever its cause, does not grow to be much larger during the calculation.[13] This happens if the problem is 'well-conditioned', meaning that the solution changes by only a small amount if the problem data are changed by a small amount.[13] To the contrary, if a problem is 'ill-conditioned', then any small error in the data will grow to be a large error.[13]\nBoth the original problem and the algorithm used to solve that problem can be 'well-conditioned' or 'ill-conditioned', and any combination is possible.\nSo an algorithm that solves a well-conditioned problem may be either numerically stable or numerically unstable. An art of numerical analysis is to find a stable algorithm for solving a well-posed mathematical problem. For instance, computing the square root of 2 (which is roughly 1.41421) is a well-posed problem. Many algorithms solve this problem by starting with an initial approximation x0 to \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {2}}}\n\n, for instance x0 = 1.4, and then computing improved guesses x1, x2, etc. One such method is the famous Babylonian method, which is given by xk+1 = xk/2 + 1/xk. Another method, called 'method X', is given by xk+1 = (xk2 \u2212 2)2 + xk.[note 1] A few iterations of each scheme are calculated in table form below, with initial guesses x0 = 1.4 and x0 = 1.42.\nObserve that the Babylonian method converges quickly regardless of the initial guess, whereas Method X converges extremely slowly with initial guess x0 = 1.4 and diverges for initial guess x0 = 1.42. Hence, the Babylonian method is numerically stable, while Method X is numerically unstable.\nThe field of numerical analysis includes many sub-disciplines. Some of the major ones are:\nInterpolation: Observing that the temperature varies from 20 degrees Celsius at 1:00 to 14 degrees at 3:00, a linear interpolation of this data would conclude that it was 17 degrees at 2:00 and 18.5 degrees at 1:30pm.\nExtrapolation: If the gross domestic product of a country has been growing an average of 5% per year and was 100 billion last year, it might extrapolated that it will be 105 billion this year.\nRegression: In linear regression, given n points, a line is computed that passes as close as possible to those n points.\nOptimization: Suppose lemonade is sold at a lemonade stand, at $1.00 per glass, that 197 glasses of lemonade can be sold per day, and that for each increase of $0.01, one less glass of lemonade will be sold per day. If $1.485 could be charged, profit would be maximized, but due to the constraint of having to charge a whole-cent amount, charging $1.48 or $1.49 per glass will both yield the maximum income of $220.52 per day.\nDifferential equation: If 100 fans are set up to blow air from one end of the room to the other and then a feather is dropped into the wind, what happens? The feather will follow the air currents, which may be very complex. One approximation is to measure the speed at which the air is blowing near the feather every second, and advance the simulated feather as if it were moving in a straight line at that same speed for one second, before measuring the wind speed again. This is called the Euler method for solving an ordinary differential equation.\nOne of the simplest problems is the evaluation of a function at a given point. The most straightforward approach, of just plugging in the number in the formula is sometimes not very efficient. For polynomials, a better approach is using the Horner scheme, since it reduces the necessary number of multiplications and additions. Generally, it is important to estimate and control round-off errors arising from the use of floating-point arithmetic.\nInterpolation solves the following problem: given the value of some unknown function at a number of points, what value does that function have at some other point between the given points?\nExtrapolation is very similar to interpolation, except that now the value of the unknown function at a point which is outside the given points must be found.[14]\nRegression is also similar, but it takes into account that the data are imprecise. Given some points, and a measurement of the value of some function at these points (with an error), the unknown function can be found. The least squares-method is one way to achieve this.\nAnother fundamental problem is computing the solution of some given equation. Two cases are commonly distinguished, depending on whether the equation is linear or not. For instance, the equation \n\n\n\n2\nx\n+\n5\n=\n3\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 2x+5=3}\n\n is linear while \n\n\n\n2\n\nx\n\n2\n\n\n+\n5\n=\n3\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 2x^{2}+5=3}\n\n is not.\nMuch effort has been put in the development of methods for solving systems of linear equations. Standard direct methods, i.e., methods that use some matrix decomposition are Gaussian elimination, LU decomposition, Cholesky decomposition for symmetric (or hermitian) and positive-definite matrix, and QR decomposition for non-square matrices. Iterative methods such as the Jacobi method, Gauss\u2013Seidel method, successive over-relaxation and conjugate gradient method[15] are usually preferred for large systems. General iterative methods can be developed using a matrix splitting.\nRoot-finding algorithms are used to solve nonlinear equations (they are so named since a root of a function is an argument for which the function yields zero). If the function is differentiable and the derivative is known, then Newton's method is a popular choice.[16][17] Linearization is another technique for solving nonlinear equations.\nSeveral important problems can be phrased in terms of eigenvalue decompositions or singular value decompositions. For instance, the spectral image compression algorithm[18] is based on the singular value decomposition. The corresponding tool in statistics is called principal component analysis.\nOptimization problems ask for the point at which a given function is maximized (or minimized). Often, the point also has to satisfy some constraints.\nThe field of optimization is further split in several subfields, depending on the form of the objective function and the constraint. For instance, linear programming deals with the case that both the objective function and the constraints are linear. A famous method in linear programming is the simplex method.\nThe method of Lagrange multipliers can be used to reduce optimization problems with constraints to unconstrained optimization problems.\nNumerical integration, in some instances also known as numerical quadrature, asks for the value of a definite integral.[19] Popular methods use one of the Newton\u2013Cotes formulas (like the midpoint rule or Simpson's rule) or Gaussian quadrature.[20] These methods rely on a \"divide and conquer\" strategy, whereby an integral on a relatively large set is broken down into integrals on smaller sets. In higher dimensions, where these methods become prohibitively expensive in terms of computational effort, one may use Monte Carlo or quasi-Monte Carlo methods (see Monte Carlo integration[21]), or, in modestly large dimensions, the method of sparse grids.\nNumerical analysis is also concerned with computing (in an approximate way) the solution of differential equations, both ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations.[22]\nPartial differential equations are solved by first discretizing the equation, bringing it into a finite-dimensional subspace.[23] This can be done by a finite element method,[24][25][26] a finite difference method,[27] or (particularly in engineering) a finite volume method.[28] The theoretical justification of these methods often involves theorems from functional analysis. This reduces the problem to the solution of an algebraic equation.\nSince the late twentieth century, most algorithms are implemented in a variety of programming languages. The Netlib repository contains various collections of software routines for numerical problems, mostly in Fortran and C. Commercial products implementing many different numerical algorithms include the IMSL and NAG libraries; a free-software alternative is the GNU Scientific Library.\nOver the years the Royal Statistical Society published numerous algorithms in its Applied Statistics (code for these \"AS\" functions is here); \nACM similarly, in its Transactions on Mathematical Software (\"TOMS\" code is here).\nThe Naval Surface Warfare Center several times published its Library of Mathematics Subroutines (code here).\nThere are several popular numerical computing applications such as MATLAB,[29][30][31] TK Solver, S-PLUS, and IDL[32] as well as free and open source alternatives such as FreeMat, Scilab,[33][34] GNU Octave (similar to Matlab), and IT++ (a C++ library). There are also programming languages such as R[35] (similar to S-PLUS), Julia,[36] and Python with libraries such as NumPy, SciPy[37][38][39] and SymPy. Performance varies widely: while vector and matrix operations are usually fast, scalar loops may vary in speed by more than an order of magnitude.[40][41]\nMany computer algebra systems such as Mathematica also benefit from the availability of arbitrary-precision arithmetic which can provide more accurate results.[42][43][44][45]\nAlso, any spreadsheet software can be used to solve simple problems relating to numerical analysis. \nExcel, for example, has hundreds of available functions, including for matrices, which may be used in conjunction with its built in \"solver\".", "links":

Wikipedia": {"text": "A web application (or web app) is application software that is accessed using a web browser. Web applications are delivered on the World Wide Web to users with an active network connection.[1]\nIn earlier computing models like client-server, the processing load for the application was shared between code on the server and code installed on each client locally.  In other words, an application had its own pre-compiled client program which served as its user interface and had to be separately installed on each user's personal computer. An upgrade to the server-side code of the application would typically also require an upgrade to the client-side code installed on each user workstation, adding to the support cost and decreasing productivity.  In addition, both the client and server components of the application were usually tightly bound to a particular computer architecture and operating system and porting them to others was often prohibitively expensive for all but the largest applications (Nowadays,[when?] native apps for mobile devices are also hobbled by some or all of the foregoing issues).[dubious  \u2013 discuss]\nIn 1995, Netscape introduced a client-side scripting language called JavaScript allowing programmers to add some dynamic elements to the user interface that ran on the client side. So instead of sending data to the server in order to generate an entire web page, the embedded scripts of the downloaded page can perform various tasks such as input validation or showing/hiding parts of the page.[2]\nIn 1999, the \"web application\" concept was introduced in the Java language in the Servlet Specification version 2.2. [2.1?].[3][non-primary source needed] At that time both JavaScript and XML had already been developed, but Ajax had still not yet been coined and the XMLHttpRequest object had only been recently introduced on Internet Explorer 5 as an ActiveX object.[citation needed]\nApplications like Gmail started to make their client sides more and more interactive since early 2000s. A web page script is able to contact the server for storing/retrieving data without downloading an entire web page. The practice became known as Ajax in 2005.[4]\n\"Progressive web apps\", the term coined by designer Frances Berriman and Google Chrome engineer Alex Russell in 2015,[5] refers to apps taking advantage of new features supported by modern browsers, which initially run inside a web browser tab but later can run completely offline and can be launched without entering app URL in the browser.\nTraditional PC applications consist only of 1 tier, which resides on the client machine, but web applications lend themselves to a multi-tiered approach by nature.[6] Though many variations are possible, the most common structure is the three-tiered application.[6] In its most common form, the three tiers are called presentation, application and storage. A web browser is the first tier (presentation), an engine using some dynamic Web content technology (such as ASP, CGI, ColdFusion, Dart, JSP/Java, Node.js, PHP, Python or Ruby on Rails) is the middle tier (application logic), and a database is the third tier (storage).[6] The web browser sends requests to the middle tier, which services them by making queries and updates against the database and generates a user interface.\nFor more complex applications, a 3-tier solution may fall short, and it may be beneficial to use an n-tiered approach, where the greatest benefit is breaking the business logic, which resides on the application tier, into a more fine-grained model.[6] Another benefit may be adding an integration tier that separates the data tier from the rest of tiers by providing an easy-to-use interface to access the data.[6] For example, the client data would be accessed by calling a \"list_clients()\" function instead of making an SQL query directly against the client table on the database. This allows the underlying database to be replaced without making any change to the other tiers.[6]\nThere are some who view a web application as a two-tier architecture. This can be a \"smart\" client that performs all the work and queries a \"dumb\" server, or a \"dumb\" client that relies on a \"smart\" server.[6] The client would handle the presentation tier, the server would have the database (storage tier), and the business logic (application tier) would be on one of them or on both.[6] While this increases the scalability of the applications and separates the display and the database, it still doesn't allow for true specialization of layers, so most applications will outgrow this model.[6]\nSecurity breaches on these kinds of applications are a major concern because it can involve both enterprise information and private customer data. Protecting these assets is an important part of any web application and there \nare some key operational areas that must be included in the development process.[7] This includes processes for authentication, authorization, asset handling, input, and logging and auditing. Building security into the applications from the beginning can be more effective and less disruptive in the long run.\nWriting web applications is simplified with the use of web application frameworks. These frameworks facilitate rapid application development by allowing a development team to focus on the parts of their application which are unique to their goals without having to resolve common development issues such as user management.[8] Many of the frameworks in use are open-source software.\nIn addition, there is potential for the development of applications on Internet operating systems, although currently there are not many viable platforms that fit this model.[citation needed]", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application", "

Style - Wikipedia": {"text": "This Manual of Style (MoS or MOS) is the style manual for all English Wikipedia articles (though provisions related to accessibility apply across the entire project, not just to articles). This primary page is supported by further detail pages, which are cross-referenced here and listed at Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Contents. If any contradiction arises, this page has precedence.[a]\nEditors should write articles using straightforward, succinct, easily understood language and structure articles with consistent, reader-friendly layouts and formatting (which are detailed in this guide).\nWhere more than one style or format is acceptable under the MoS, one should be used consistently within an article and should not be changed without good reason. Edit warring over stylistic choices is unacceptable.[b]\nNew content added to this page should directly address a persistently recurring style issue.\nSometimes the MoS provides more than one acceptable style or gives no specific guidance. The Arbitration Committee has expressed the principle that \"When either of two styles are acceptable it is inappropriate for a Wikipedia editor to change from one style to another unless there is some substantial reason for the change.\"[c]\nIf you believe an alternative style would be more appropriate for a particular article, discuss this at the article's talk page or\u00a0\u2013 if it raises an issue of more general application or with the MoS itself\u00a0\u2013 at Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style.\nEdit-warring over style, or enforcing optional style in a bot-like fashion without prior consensus, is never acceptable.[b][d]\nFor retention of an article's established national variety of English (and potential reasons to change it), see \u00a7\u00a0National varieties of English.\nA title should be a recognizable name or description of the topic that is natural, sufficiently precise, concise, and consistent with those of related articles. If these criteria are in conflict, they should be balanced against one another.\nFor formatting guidance see the Wikipedia:Article titles \u00a7\u00a0Article title format section, noting the following:\nSubject both to the above and to Wikipedia:Article titles, the rest of the MoS, particularly \u00a7\u00a0Punctuation, applies also to the title.\nSee also Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Titles, for cases where a Wikipedia article about a published work has a title that coincides with the work's title.\nAn article's content should begin with an introductory lead section\u00a0\u2013 a concise summary of the article\u00a0\u2013 which is never divided into sections (see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lead section). The remainder of the article is typically divided into sections.\nInfoboxes, images, and related content in the lead section must be right-aligned.\nCertain standardized templates and wikicode that are not sections go at the very top of the article, before the content of the lead section, and in the following order:\nIf an article has at least four section headings, a navigable table of contents appears automatically, just after the lead.\nIf the topic of a section is covered in more detail in a dedicated article (see Wikipedia:Summary style), insert {{main|Article name}} or {{further|Article name}} immediately under the section heading.\nAs explained in detail in Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Layout \u00a7\u00a0Standard appendices and footers, several kinds of material (mostly optional) may appear after the main body of the article, in the following order:\nStand-alone list articles have some additional layout considerations.\nSection headings should generally follow the guidance for article titles (above), and should be presented in sentence case (Funding of UNESCO projects in developing countries), not title case (Funding of UNESCO Projects in Developing Countries).[e]\nFor technical reasons, section headings should:\nThese technical restrictions are necessary to avoid technical complications and are not subject to override by local consensus.\nAs a matter of consistent style, section headings should:\nThese are broadly accepted community preferences.\nAn invisible comment on the same line must be inside the ==\u00a0== markup:[h]\n==<!--This comment works fine.-->Implications== \n==Implications==<!--This comment causes problems.-->\nIt is more usual practice to put such comments below the heading.\nBefore changing a heading, consider whether you might be breaking existing links to it. If there are many links to the old title, create an anchor with that title to ensure that these still work. Similarly, when linking to a section, leave an invisible comment at the heading of the target section, naming the linking articles, so that if the heading is later altered these can be fixed. Combined example:\nwhich will be saved in the article as:\nThe advantage of using {{subst:Anchor}}, or simply inserting the <span> tags directly, is that when edits are made to the section in the future, the anchor will not be included in page history entries as part of the section name. When {{Anchor}} is used directly, that undesirable behavior does occur. Note: if electing to insert the span directly, do not abbreviate it by using a self-closing tag, as in ==Implications<span id=\"Consequences\" />==, since in HTML5 that XML-style syntax is valid only for certain tags, such as <br />.[1] See Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Linking \u00a7\u00a0Avoiding broken section links for further discussion.\nThe above guidance about sentence case, redundancy, images, and questions also applies to headers of tables (and of table columns and rows). However, table headings can incorporate citations and may begin with, or be, numbers. Unlike page headings, table headers do not automatically generate link anchors. Aside from sentence case in glossaries, the heading advice also applies to the term entries in description lists. If using template-structured glossaries, terms will automatically have link anchors, but will not otherwise. Citations for description-list content go in the term or definition element, as needed.\nNational varieties of English (for example, American English or British English) differ in vocabulary (elevator vs. lift\u200a), spelling (center vs. centre), and occasionally grammar (see \u00a7\u00a0Plurals, below). Articles such as English plurals and Comparison of American and British English provide information about such differences. The English Wikipedia prefers no national variety over others.\nAn article's date formatting (April 22, 2023 vs. 22 April 2023) is also related to national varieties of English\u00a0\u2013 see MOS:DATEFORMAT and especially MOS:DATETIES and MOS:DATEVAR.\nWithin a given article the conventions of one particular variety of English should be followed consistently. Exceptions include:\nFor an international encyclopedia, using vocabulary common to all varieties of English is preferable.\nFor assistance with specific terms, see Comparison of American and British English \u00a7\u00a0Vocabulary, and American and British English spelling differences; most dictionaries also indicate regional terms.\nAn article on a topic that has strong ties to a particular English-speaking nation should use the (formal, not colloquial) English of that nation. For example:\nFor topics with strong ties to Commonwealth of Nations countries and other former British territories, use Commonwealth English orthography, largely indistinguishable from British English in encyclopedic writing (excepting Canada, which uses a different orthography).\nWhen an English variety's consistent usage has been established in an article, maintain it in the absence of consensus to the contrary. With few exceptions (e.g., when a topic has strong national ties or the change reduces ambiguity), there is no valid reason for changing from one acceptable option to another.\nWhen no English variety has been established and discussion does not resolve the issue, use the variety found in the first post-stub revision that introduced an identifiable variety. The established variety in a given article can be documented by placing the appropriate Varieties of English template on its talk page.\nAn article should not be edited or renamed simply to switch from one variety of English to another. {{subst:uw-engvar}} may be placed on an editor's talk page to explain this.\nWikipedia article titles and section headings use sentence case, not title case; see Wikipedia:Article titles and \u00a7\u00a0Section headings. For capitalization of list items, see \u00a7\u00a0Bulleted and numbered lists. Other points concerning capitalization are summarized below. Full information can be found at Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters. The central point is that Wikipedia does not capitalize something unless it is consistently capitalized in a substantial majority of independent, reliable sources.\nGenerally, do not capitalize the word the in mid-sentence: throughout the United Kingdom, not throughout The United Kingdom. Conventional exceptions include certain proper names (he visited The Hague) and most titles of creative works (Tolkien wrote The Lord of the Rings\u00a0\u2013 but be aware that the may not be part of the title itself, e.g., Homer composed the Odyssey).\nThere are special considerations for: band names \u00b7\u00a0institution names \u00b7\u00a0nicknames \u00b7\u00a0titles of works \u00b7\u00a0trademarks.\nThe English-language titles of compositions (books and other print works, songs and other audio works, films and other visual media works, paintings and other artworks, etc.) are given in title case, in which every word is given an initial capital except for certain less important words (as detailed at Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters \u00a7\u00a0Composition titles). The first and last words in an English-language title are always capitalized.\nCapitalization in foreign-language titles varies, even over time within the same language; generally, retain the style of the original for modern works, and follow the usage in current[i] English-language reliable sources for historical works. When written in the Latin alphabet, many of these items should also be in italics, or enclosed in quotation marks.\nWhen using taxonomic (\"scientific\") names, capitalize and italicize the genus: Berberis, Erithacus. (Supergenus and subgenus, when applicable, are treated the same way.) Italicize but do not capitalize taxonomic ranks at the level of species and below: Berberis darwinii, Erithacus rubecula superbus, Acacia coriacea subsp. sericophylla; no exception is made for proper names forming part of scientific names. Higher taxa (order, family, etc.) are capitalized in Latin (Carnivora, Felidae) but not in their English equivalents (carnivorans, felids); they are not italicized in either form, except for viruses, where all names accepted by the ICTV are italicized (Retroviridae).\nCultivar and cultivar group names of plants are not italicized, and are capitalized (including the word Group in the name); cultivar names appear within single quotes (Malus domestica 'Red Delicious'), while cultivar groups do not (Cynara cardunculus Scolymus Group).\nEnglish vernacular (\"common\") names are given in lower case in article prose (plains zebra, mountain\u00a0maple, and southwestern red-tailed hawk) and in sentence case at the start of sentences and in other places where the first letter of the first word is capitalized.[e] They are additionally capitalized where they contain proper names: Przewalski's\u00a0horse, California\u00a0condor, and fair-maid-of-France. This applies to species and subspecies, as in the previous examples, as well as to general names for groups or types of organism: bird\u00a0of\u00a0prey, oak, great\u00a0apes, Bryde's\u00a0whales, livestock\u00a0guardian\u00a0dog, poodle, Van\u00a0cat, wolfdog. When the common name coincides with a scientific taxon, do not capitalize or italicize, except where addressing the organism taxonomically: A lynx is any of the four medium-sized wild cat species within the genus Lynx. Non-English vernacular names, when relevant to include, are handled like any other foreign-language terms: italicized as such, and capitalized only if the rules of the native language require it. Non-English names that have become English-assimilated are treated as English (ayahuasca, okapi).\nStandardized breeds should generally retain the capitalization used in the breed standards.[k] Examples: German Shepherd dog, Russian White goat, Berlin Short-faced Tumbler. As with plant cultivars, this applies whether or not the included noun is a proper name, in contrast to how vernacular names of species are written. However, unlike cultivars, breeds are never put in single quotation marks, and their names are never part of a scientific name. A species term appended at the end for disambiguation (\"cat\", \"hound\", \"horse\", \"swine\", etc.) should not be capitalized, unless it is a part of the breed name itself and is consistently presented that way in the breed standard(s) (rare cases include Norwegian Forest Cat and American Quarter Horse).\nCreate redirects from alternative capitalization and spelling forms of article titles, and from alternative names, e.g., Ad\u00e9lie Penguin, Adelie penguin, Adelie Penguin and Pygoscelis adeliae should all redirect to Ad\u00e9lie penguin.\nDo not capitalize directions such as north, or their related forms (We took the northern road), except where they are parts of proper names (Great North Road, Great Western Drive, South Pole).\nCapitalize names of regions if they have attained proper-name status, including informal conventional names (Southern California; the Western Desert), and derived terms for people (e.g., a Southerner as someone from the Southern United States). Do not capitalize descriptive names for regions that have not attained the status of proper names, such as southern Poland.\nComposite directions may or may not be hyphenated, depending on the variety of English adopted in the article. Southeast Asia and northwest are more common in American English; but South-East Asia and north-west in British English. In cases such as north\u2013south dialogue and east\u2013west orientation, use an en dash; see \u00a7\u00a0En dashes: other uses.\nCapitalize names of particular institutions (the founding of the University of Delhi;\u00a0 the history of Stanford University) but not generic words for institutions (the high school is near the university). Do not capitalize the at the start of an institution's name, regardless of the institution's preferred style. There are rare exceptions, when a leading The is represented by a T in the organization's acronym: The International Cat Association (TICA).\nTreat political or geographic units similarly: The city has a population of 55,000;\u00a0 The two towns merged to become the City of Smithville. Do not mimic the style of local newspapers which refer to their municipality as the City or The City; an exception is the City of London, referred to as the City in a context that already makes the subject clear, as distinct from London and Greater London. When in doubt, use the full name for accessibility reasons; users of text-to-speech systems usually cannot hear a difference between city and City.\nLigatures should be used in languages in which they are standard (hence Moreau's last words were clin d'\u0153il is preferable to Moreau's last words were clin d'oeil) but not in English (encyclopedia or encyclopaedia, not encyclop\u00e6dia), except in proper names (\u00c6thelstan, not Aethelstan).\nAbbreviations are shortened forms of words or phrases. In strict analysis, they are distinct from contractions, which use an apostrophe (e.g., won't, see \u00a7\u00a0Contractions), and initialisms. An initialism is formed from some or all of the initial letters of words in a phrase. Below, references to abbreviations should be taken to include acronyms, and the term acronym to apply also to initialisms.\nWhen an abbreviation will be used in an article, first introduce it using the full expression:\nDo not use capitals in the full version merely because capitals are used in the abbreviation: an early Local Area Network (LAN).\nExcept in special circumstances, common abbreviations (such as PhD, DNA, USSR) need not be expanded even on first use.\nPluralize acronyms by adding -s or -es: Three CD-ROMs and two BIOSes were released. (Do not use apostrophes to form plurals: Three CD-ROM's and two BIOS's were released.)\nAn abbreviation may or may not be terminated with a full point (also called a period or full stop). A consistent style should be maintained within an article. North American usage is typically to end all abbreviations with a period/point (Dr. Smith of 42\u00a0Drummond St.) but in common British and Australian usage, no period/point is used if the abbreviation (contraction) ends in the last letter of the unabbreviated form (Dr Smith of 42\u00a0Drummond St) unless confusion could result. This is also common practice in scientific writing. Regardless of punctuation, words that are abbreviated to more than one letter are spaced (op.\u00a0cit. not op.cit. or opcit). There are some exceptions: PhD (see above) for \"Philosophiae Doctor\"; BVetMed for \"Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine\". In most situations, Wikipedia uses no such punctuation inside acronyms and initialisms: GDP, not G.D.P.\nWhile, in principle, either US or U.S. may be used (with internal consistency) to abbreviate \"United States\" in any given article, the use or non-use of periods (full stops) should also be consistent with other country abbreviations in the same article (thus the US, UK, and USSR, not the U.S., UK, and USSR). In longer abbreviations (three letters or more) that incorporate the country's initials (USN, USAID), do not use periods. When the United States is mentioned with one or more other countries in the same sentence, U.S. or US may be too informal, especially at the first mention or as a noun instead of an adjective (France and the United States, not France and the US). Do not use the spaced U.\u00a0S. or the archaic U.S.\u00a0of\u00a0A., except when quoting; and do not use U.S.A. or USA except in a quotation, as part of a proper name (Team USA), or in certain technical or formal uses (e.g., the ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 codes and FIFA country codes).\nTo indicate approximately, the use of {{circa}}, showing as c., is preferred over circa, c., ca., or approx.\nAvoid abbreviations when they might confuse the reader, interrupt the flow, or appear informal. For example:\nGenerally avoid devising new abbreviations, especially acronyms. For example, World Union of Billiards is good as a translation of Union Mondiale de Billard, but neither it nor the reduction WUB is used by the organization or by independent sources; use the original name and its official abbreviation, UMB.\nIf it is necessary to abbreviate in a tight space, such as a column header in a table, use widely recognized abbreviations. For example, for New Zealand gross national product, use NZ and GNP, with a link if the term has not already been written out in the article: NZ\u00a0GNP. Do not make up initialisms such as NZGNP.\nEither <abbr> or {{abbr}} can be used for abbreviations and acronyms: <abbr title=\"World Health Organization\">WHO</abbr> or {{abbr|WHO|World Health Organization}} will generate WHO; hovering over the rendered text causes a tooltip of the long form to pop up.\nIn normal text and headings, use and instead of the ampersand (&): January 1\u00a0and\u00a02, not January 1\u00a0&\u00a02. But retain an ampersand when it is a legitimate part of the style of a proper noun, the title of a work, or a trademark, such as in Up\u00a0&\u00a0Down or AT&T. Elsewhere, ampersands may be used with consistency and discretion where space is extremely limited (e.g., tables and infoboxes). Quotations may be cautiously modified, especially for consistency where different editions are quoted, as modern editions of old texts routinely replace ampersands with and (just as they replace other disused glyphs, ligatures, and abbreviations). Another frequent permissible but not required use is in short bibliographic references to works by multiple authors, e.g.: \u00a0... a series of French and Belgian papers (Lubbers & Scheepers, 2002; Van Hiel & Mervielde, 2002; Swyngedouw & Giles, 2007; Van Hiel, 2012).\nItalics are used for emphasis, rather than boldface or capitals. But overuse diminishes its effect; consider rewriting instead.\nUse <em>...</em> or {{em|...}} for emphasis. This allows user style sheets to handle emphasis in a customized way, and helps reusers and translators.[2]\nUse italics for the titles of works (such as books, films, television series, named exhibitions, computer games, music albums, and artworks). The titles of articles, chapters, songs, episodes, storylines, research papers and other short works instead take double quotation marks.\nItalics are not used for major religious works (the Bible, the Quran, the Talmud).\nMany of these titles should also be in title case.\nUse italics when mentioning a word or character (see Use\u2013mention distinction) or a string of words up to one sentence (the term panning is derived from panorama; the most common letter in English is e). When a whole sentence is mentioned, double quotation marks may be used instead, with consistency (The preposition in She sat on the chair is on; or The preposition in \"She sat on the chair\" is \"on\"). Quotation marks may also be used for shorter material to avoid confusion, such as when italics are already being heavily used in the page for some other purpose (e.g., many non-English words and phrases). Mentioning (to discuss grammar, wording, punctuation, etc.) is different from quoting (in which something is usually expressed on behalf of a quoted source). Quotation is done with quotation marks, never italics, nor both at once (see \u00a7\u00a0Quotations for details).\nA closely related use of italics is when introducing or distinguishing terms: The natural numbers are the integers greater than 0.\nItalics is indicated for phrases in other languages and for isolated foreign words that are not common in everyday English. However, proper names (such as place names) in other languages are not usually italicized, nor are terms in non-Latin scripts. The {{lang}} template and its variants support all ISO 639 language codes, correctly identifying the language and automatically italicizing for you. Please use these templates rather than just manually italicizing non-English material. (See WP:Manual of Style/Accessibility \u00a7\u00a0Other languages for more information.)\nUse italics for the scientific names of plants, animals, and all other organisms except viruses at the genus level and below (italicize Panthera leo and Retroviridae, but not Felidae). The hybrid sign is not italicized (Rosa\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0damascena), nor is the \"connecting term\" required in three-part botanical names (Rosa gallica subsp. officinalis).\nDo not use italics for quotations. Instead, use quotation marks for short quotations and block quoting for long ones.\nUse italics within quotations to reproduce emphasis that exists in the source material. If it is not clear that the source already included italics (or some other styling) for emphasis, add the editorial note [emphasis in original] after the quotation.\nIf adding emphasis that was not in the original, add the editorial note [emphasis added] after the quotation.\nItalicize only the elements of the sentence affected by the emphasis. Do not italicize surrounding punctuation.\nBrief quotations of copyrighted text may be used to illustrate a point, establish context, or attribute a point of view or idea. While quotations are an indispensable part of Wikipedia, try not to overuse them. Using too many quotes is incompatible with an encyclopedic writing style and may be a copyright infringement. It is generally recommended that content be written in Wikipedia editors' own words. Consider paraphrasing quotations into plain and concise text when appropriate (while being aware that close paraphrasing can still violate copyright).\nQuotations must be verifiably attributed, and the wording of the quoted text should be faithfully reproduced. This is referred to as the principle of minimal change. Where there is good reason to change the wording, bracket the changed text; for example, \"Ocyrhoe told him his fate\" might be quoted as \"Ocyrhoe told [her father] his fate\". If there is a significant error in the original, follow it with {{sic}} (producing  [sic]\u200a) to show that the error was not made by Wikipedia.  However, insignificant spelling and typographic errors should simply be silently corrected (for example, correct basicly to basically).\nUse ellipses to indicate omissions from quoted text. Legitimate omissions include extraneous, irrelevant, or parenthetical words, and unintelligible speech (umm and hmm), but do not omit text where doing so would remove important context or alter the meaning of the text. Vulgarities and obscenities should be shown exactly as they appear in the quoted source; Wikipedians should never bowdlerize words (G-d d--m it!), but if the text being quoted itself does so, copy the text verbatim and use {{sic}} to indicate that the text is quoted as shown in the source.\nIn direct quotations, retain dialectal and archaic spellings, including capitalization (but not archaic glyphs and ligatures, as detailed below).\nQuotation should be used, with attribution, to present emotive opinions that cannot be expressed in Wikipedia's own voice, but never to present cultural norms as simply opinional:\nConcise opinions that are not overly emotive can often be reported with attribution instead of direct quotation. Use of quotation marks around simple descriptive terms can imply something doubtful regarding the material being quoted; sarcasm or weasel words such as supposedly or so-called, might be inferred.\nA quotation is not a facsimile and, in most cases, it is not a requirement that the original formatting be preserved. Formatting and other purely typographical elements of quoted text[l] should be adapted to English Wikipedia's conventions without comment, provided that doing so will not change or obscure meaning or intent of the text. These are alterations which make no difference when the text is read aloud, for example:\nSee Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Titles \u00a7\u00a0Typographic conformity for special considerations in normalizing the typography of titles of works.\nHowever, national varieties should not be changed, as these may involve changes in vocabulary. For example, a quotation from a British source should retain British spelling, even in an article that otherwise uses American spelling. (See \u00a7\u00a0Consistency within articles.) Numbers also usually should not be reformatted.\nDirect quotation should not be used to preserve the formatting preferred by an external publisher (especially when the material would otherwise be unchanged), as this tends to have the effect of \"scare-quoting\":\nItalics can be used to mark a particular usage as a term of art (a case of \"words as words\"), especially when it is unfamiliar or should not be reworded by a non-expert:\nWhen quoting a complete sentence, it is usually recommended to keep the first word capitalized. However, if the quoted passage has been integrated into the surrounding sentence (for example, with an introduction such as \"X said that\"), the original capital letter may be lower-cased.\nIt is not normally necessary to explicitly note changes in capitalization. However, for more precision, the altered letter may be put inside square brackets: \"The\" \u2192 \"[t]he\".\nThe reader must be able to determine the source of any quotation, at the very least via a footnote. The source must be named in article text if the quotation is an opinion (see Wikipedia:Neutral point of view \u00a7\u00a0Attributing and specifying biased statements). When attributing a quotation, avoid characterizing it in a biased manner.\nSee \u00a7\u00a0For a quotation within a quotation.\nBe conservative when linking within quotations: link only to targets that correspond to the meaning clearly intended by the quote's author. Where possible, link from text outside of the quotation instead \u2013 either before it or soon after. (If quoting hypertext, add an editorial note, [link in original] or [link added], as appropriate, to avoid ambiguity as to whether the link was made by the original author.)\nFormat a long quote (more than about forty words or a few hundred characters, or consisting of more than one paragraph, regardless of length) as a block quotation, indented on both sides. Block quotations should be enclosed in {{blockquote}}.\nDo not enclose block quotations in quotation marks (and especially avoid large, decorative quotation marks; those provided by the {{cquote}} template have been disabled in mainspace). Block quotations using a colored background are also discouraged.\nUse {{blockquote}} and so on only for actual quotations; indentation for other purposes is done differently.\nIt is conventional to precede a block quotation with an introductory sentence (or sentence fragment) and append the source citation to that line. Alternatively, the {{blockquote}} template provides parameters for attribution and citation which will appear below the quotation. (For use of dashes with attributions, see \u00a7\u00a0Other uses (em dash only).) This below-quotation attribution style is intended for famous quotations and is unusual in articles because it may strike an inappropriate tone. A quotation with no cited source should be flagged with {{quote without source}}, or deleted.\nLine breaks and indentation inside a {{blockquote}} or <blockquote> are generally ignored; use <poem> or {{poem quote}} for poetry, lyrics, and similar material:\nThis gives:\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meant in croaking \"Nevermore.\"\nOr quote such material inline, with line breaks indicated by {{nbsp}}/, and paragraph or stanza breaks by {{nbsp}}//.\nPull quotes do not belong in Wikipedia articles. These are the news and magazine style of \"pulling\" material already in the article to reuse it in attention-grabbing decorative quotations. This unencyclopedic approach is a form of editorializing, produces out-of-context and undue emphasis, and may lead the reader to conclusions not supported in the material.\nQuotations from foreign-language sources should appear with a translation into English, preferably a modern[i] one. Quotations that are translations should be explicitly distinguished from those that are not. Indicate the original source of a translation (if it is available, and not first published within Wikipedia), and the original language (if that is not clear from the context).\nIf the original, untranslated text is available, provide a reference for it or include it, as appropriate.\nWhen editors themselves translate foreign text into English, care must always be taken to include the original text, in italics (except for non-Latin-based writing systems), and to use actual and (if at all possible) common English words in the translation. Unless you are certain of your competency to translate something, see Wikipedia:Translation for assistance.\nIn the material below, the term quotation includes conventional uses of quotation marks such as for titles of songs, chapters, episodes, and so on. Quotation marks are also used in other contexts, such as in cultivar names.\nMost quotations take double quotation marks (Bob said: \"Jim ate the apple.\").[m]\nExceptions:\nUse single quotes:\nFor deeper nesting, alternate between single and double quotes:\nFor quote marks in immediate succession, add a sliver of space by using {{\" '}}, {{' \"}}, or (as in the example just given) {{\" ' \"}}:\nIn the bolded text typically appearing at the opening of an article:\nIf a non-quoted but otherwise identical construction would work grammatically without a comma, using a comma before a quotation embedded within a sentence is optional:\nThe comma-free approach is often used with partial quotations:\nCommas are usually used with interrupted quotations (but this construction is rare in encyclopedic writing):\nA comma is required when it would be present in the same construction if none of the material were a quotation:\nDo not insert a comma if it would confuse or alter the meaning:\nIt is clearer to use a colon to introduce a quotation if it forms a complete sentence, and this should always be done for multi-sentence quotations:\nNo additional punctuation is necessary for an explicit words-as-words scenario:\nQuotation marks should be used for the following names and titles:\nFor example: The song \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" from the album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band by the band the Beatles.\nDo not use quotation marks or italics for:\nMany, but not all, of the above items should also be in title case.\nUse the \"logical quotation\" style in all articles, regardless of the variety of English in which they are written. Include terminal punctuation within the quotation marks only if it was present in the original material, and otherwise place it after the closing quotation mark. For the most part, this means treating periods and commas in the same way as question marks: keep them inside the quotation marks if they apply only to the quoted material and outside if they apply to the whole sentence. Examples are given below.\nIf the quotation is a single word or a sentence fragment, place the terminal punctuation outside the closing quotation mark. When quoting a full sentence, the end of which coincides with the end of the sentence containing it, place terminal punctuation inside the closing quotation mark.\nIf the quoted sentence is followed by a clause that should be preceded by a comma, omit the full stop (period) \u2013 but other terminal punctuation, such as a question mark or exclamation mark, may be retained.\nIf the quoted sentence is followed by a clause identifying the speaker, use a comma outside the quotation mark instead of a full stop inside it, but retain any other terminal punctuation, such as question marks.\nDo not follow quoted words or fragments with commas inside the quotation marks, except where a longer quotation has been broken up and the comma is part of the full quotation.\nThis section applies to both round brackets (\u00a0), often called parentheses, and square brackets [\u00a0].\nIf a sentence contains a bracketed phrase, place the sentence punctuation outside the brackets (as shown here). However, where one or more sentences are wholly inside brackets, place their punctuation inside the brackets. There should be no space next to the inner side of a bracket. An opening bracket should usually be preceded by a space. This may not be the case if it is preceded by an opening quotation mark, another opening bracket, or a portion of a word:\nThere should be a space after a closing bracket, except where a punctuation mark follows (though a spaced dash would still be spaced after a closing bracket) and in unusual cases similar to those listed for opening brackets.\nAvoid adjacent sets of brackets. Either put the parenthetical phrases in one set separated by semicolons, or rewrite:\nSquare brackets are used to indicate editorial replacements and insertions within quotations, though this should never alter the intended meaning. They serve three main purposes:\nIf a sentence includes subsidiary material enclosed in square or round brackets, it must still carry terminal punctuation after those brackets, regardless of any punctuation within the brackets.\nHowever, if the entire sentence is within brackets, the closing punctuation falls within the brackets. (This sentence is an example.)\nSquare brackets inside of links must be escaped:\nHe said, \"John [Doe] answered.\"\nHe said, \"John [Doe] answered.\"\nOn the first day [etc.]\nOn the first day [etc.]\nThe <nowiki> markup can also be used: <nowiki>[Doe]</nowiki> or <nowiki>[etc.]</nowiki>.\nIf a URL itself contains square brackets, the wiki-text should use the URL-encoded form https://example.com/foo.php?query=%5Bxxx%5Dyyy, rather than\u00a0...query=[xxx]yyy. This will avoid truncation of the link after xxx.\nUse an ellipsis (plural ellipses) if material is omitted in the course of a quotation, unless square brackets are used to gloss the quotation (see \u00a7\u00a0Brackets and parentheses, and the points below).\nAlways use a pair of commas for this, unless another punctuation mark takes the place of the second comma:\nA serial comma (sometimes also called an Oxford comma or Harvard comma) is a comma used immediately before a conjunction (and, or, nor) in a list of three or more items.\nEditors may use either convention so long as each article is internally consistent. Serial commas are more helpful the more complex the material, such as a list with multi-word items (especially if one contains its own and) or a series of probably unfamiliar terms.\nHowever, there are cases in which either omitting or including the serial comma results in ambiguity:\nIn such cases of ambiguity, clarify one of four ways:\nA colon (:) introduces something that demonstrates, explains, or modifies what has come before, or is a list of items that has just been introduced. The items in such a list may be separated by commas, or if they are more complex and perhaps themselves contain commas, the items should be separated by semicolons or arranged in a bulleted list.\nA colon may also be used to introduce direct speech enclosed within quotation marks (see \u00a7\u00a0Quotation marks).\nIn most cases, a colon works best with a complete grammatical sentence before it. When what follows the colon is also a complete sentence, start it with a capital letter, but otherwise, do not capitalize after a colon except where doing so is needed for another reason, as for a proper name.\nExcept in technical usage (a 3:1 ratio), no sentence should contain multiple colons, no space should precede a colon, and a space (but never a hyphen or dash) should follow the colon.\nA semicolon (;) is sometimes an alternative to a full stop (period), enabling related material to be kept in the same sentence; it marks a more decisive division in a sentence than a comma. If the semicolon separates clauses, normally each clause must be independent (meaning that it could stand on its own as a sentence). In many cases, only a comma or only a semicolon will be correct in a given sentence.\nAbove, \"Though he had been here before\" cannot stand on its own as a sentence, and therefore is not an independent clause.\nThis incorrect use of a comma between two independent clauses is known as a comma splice; however, in certain kinds of cases, a comma may be used where a semicolon would seem to be called for:\nA sentence may contain several semicolons, especially when the clauses are parallel in construction and meaning; multiple unrelated semicolons are often signs that the sentence should be divided into shorter sentences or otherwise refashioned.\nSemicolons are used in addition to commas to separate items in a listing, when commas alone would result in confusion.\nThe meaning of a sentence containing a trailing clause that starts with the word however depends on the punctuation preceding that word. A common error is to use the wrong punctuation, thereby changing the meaning to one not intended.\nWhen the word however is an adverb meaning \"nevertheless\", it should be preceded by a semicolon and followed by a comma. Example:\nWhen the word however is a conjunction meaning \"in whatever manner\", or \"regardless of how\", it may be preceded by a comma but not by a semicolon, and should not be followed by punctuation. Example:\nIn the first case, the clause that starts with \"however\" cannot be swapped with the first clause; in the second case this can be done without change of meaning:\nIf the two clauses cannot be swapped, a semicolon is required.\nA sentence or clause can also contain the word however in the middle, if it is an adverb meaning \"although\" that could have been placed at the beginning but does not start a new clause in mid-sentence. In this use, the word may be enclosed between commas. Example:\nHyphens (-) indicate conjunction. There are three main uses:\nMulti-word hyphenated items: It is often possible to avoid multi-word hyphenated modifiers by rewording (a four-CD soundtrack album may be easier to read as a soundtrack album of four CDs). This is particularly important where converted units are involved (the 6-hectare-limit (14.8-acre-limit) rule might be possible as the rule imposing a limit of six hectares (14.8 acres), and the ungainly 4.9-mile (7.9\u00a0km) -long tributary as simply 4.9-mile (7.9\u00a0km) tributary).\nFor optional hyphenation of compound points of the compass such as southwest/south-west, see \u00a7\u00a0Compass points.\nDo not use a capital letter after a hyphen except for a proper name: Graeco-Roman and Mediterranean-style, but not Gandhi-Like. In titles of published works, follow the capitalization rule for each part independently (resulting in, e.g., The Out-of-Towners), unless reliable sources consistently do otherwise in a particular case (The History of Middle-earth).\nHyphenation rules in other languages may be different. Thus, in French a place name such as Trois-Rivi\u00e8res (\"Three Rivers\") is hyphenated, when it would not be in English. Follow reliable sources in such cases.\nSpacing: A hyphen is never followed or preceded by a space, except when hanging (see above) or when used to display parts of words independently, such as the prefix sub-\u00a0and the suffix\u00a0-less.\nImage filenames and redirects: Image filenames are not part of the encyclopedic content; they are tools. They are most useful if they can be readily typed, so they usually use hyphens instead of dashes. Similarly, article titles with dashes should also have a corresponding redirect from a copy of the title with hyphens: for example, Michelson-Morley experiment redirects to Michelson\u2013Morley experiment.\nNon-breaking: A non-breaking hyphen ({{nbhyph}}) will not be used as a point of line-wrap.\nSoft hyphens: Use soft hyphens to mark locations where a word will be broken and hyphenated if necessary at the end of a line of text, usually in very long words or narrow spaces (such as captions, narrow table columns, or text adjacent to a very wide image), for example: {{shy| Penn|syl|va|nia and Mass|a|chu|setts style themselves com|mon|wealths.}}. Use sparingly to avoid making wikitext difficult to read and edit. For more information, see Help:Line-break handling.\nEncoding: The hyphen is represented by the ASCII/UNICODE HYPHEN-MINUS character, which is entered by the hyphen or minus key on all standard keyboards. Do not use the UNICODE HYPHEN character.\nHyphenation involves many subtleties that cannot be covered here; the rules and examples presented above illustrate the broad principles.\nTwo forms of dash are used on Wikipedia: en dash (\u2013) and em dash (\u2014). To enter them, click on them in the CharInsert toolbar, or enter them manually as:\nDo not use a double hyphen (--) to stand in for a dash. (See also: Wikipedia:How to make dashes.)\nSources use dashes in varying ways. For consistency and clarity, Wikipedia adopts the following principles.\nIn article titles, do not use a hyphen (-) as a substitute for an en dash, for example in eye\u2013hand span (since eye does not modify hand). Nonetheless, to aid searching and linking, provide a redirect with hyphens replacing the en dash(es), as in eye-hand span. Similarly, provide category redirects for categories containing dashes.\nDashes are often used to mark divisions within a sentence: in pairs (parenthetical dashes, instead of parentheses or pairs of commas) or singly (perhaps instead of a colon). They may also indicate an abrupt stop or interruption, in reporting quoted speech. In all these cases, use either unspaced em dashes or spaced en dashes, with consistency in any one article:\nIdeally, use a non-breaking space before the en dash, which prevents the en dash from occurring at the beginning of a line (markup: {{spaced ndash}} or {{snd}} or &nbsp;&ndash;):\nBut do not insert a non-breaking or other space where the en dash should be unspaced (see \u00a7\u00a0Other uses (en dash only)).\nDashes can clarify the sentence structure when there are already commas or parentheses, or both.\nUse dashes sparingly. More than two in a single sentence makes the structure unclear; it takes time for the reader to see which dashes, if any, form a pair.\nFor ranges between numbers, dates, or times, use an en dash:\nDo not change hyphens to dashes in filenames, URLs, or templates such as {{Bibleverse}} (which formats verse ranges into URLs), even if a range is embedded in them.\nDo not mix en dashes with between or from.\nThe en dash in a range is always unspaced, except when either or both elements of the range include at least one space, hyphen, or en dash; in such cases, {{snd}} between them will provide the proper formatting.\nIf negative values are involved, an unspaced en dash might be confusing:\nHere, the relationship is thought of as parallel, symmetric, equal, oppositional, or at least involving separate or independent elements. The components may be nouns, adjectives, verbs, or any other independent part of speech. Often, if the components are reversed there would be little change of meaning.\nGenerally, use a hyphen in compounded proper names of single entities.\nUse an en dash between the names of nations or nationalities when referring to an association between them. For people and things identifying with multiple nationalities, use a hyphen when using the combination adjectivally and a space when they are used as nouns, with the first used attributively to modify the second.\nA slash or some other alternative may occasionally be better to express a ratio, especially in technical contexts (see \u00a7\u00a0Slashes).\nUse an en dash for the names of two or more entities in an attributive compound.\nDo not use an en dash for hyphenated personal names, even when they are used as adjectives:\nDo not use spaces around the en dash in any of the compounds above.\nThe form of category names follows the corresponding main articles, e.g., Category:Trans\u2013New Guinea languages. \nHowever, the principle is not extended when compounding other words in category names, e.g., Category:Tennis-related lists and Category:Table tennis-related lists both use hyphens.\nSpaced en dashes are sometimes used between parts of list items. For example:\nor\nThe en dash (\u2013) has other roles, beyond its use as a sentence-punctuating dash (see immediately above). It is often analogous to the hyphen (see \u00a7\u00a0Hyphens), which joins components more strongly than the en dash; or to the slash (see \u00a7\u00a0Slashes), which separates alternatives more definitely. Consider the exact meaning when choosing which to use.\nAn indented em dash may be used before a name or other source when attributing below a block quotation, poem, etc. This dash should not be fully spaced, though it is best for metadata and accessibility reasons to hair-space it from the name.[r] Most of Wikipedia's quotation templates with attribution-related parameters already provide this formatting.\nFor example, {{in5}}\u2014{{hair space}}Charlotte Bront\u00eb will produce:\n\u2014\u200aCharlotte Bront\u00eb\nDo not use typewriter approximations or other substitutes, such as two hyphens (--), for em or en dashes.\nFor a negative sign or subtraction operator use U+2212 \u2212 MINUS SIGN (&minus;), which can also be generated by clicking on the \u2212 following the \u00b1 in the Insert toolbar beneath the edit window. Do not use U+2212 \u2212  inside a <math> tag, as the character gives a syntax error; instead use a normal hyphen U+002D - .\nGenerally, avoid joining two words with a slash, also called a forward slash, stroke or solidus (\u00a0/\u00a0), because it suggests that the words are related without specifying how. Replace with clearer wording.\nAn example: The parent/instructor must be present at all times. Must both be present? (Then write the parent and the instructor.) Must at least one be present? (Then write the parent or the instructor.) Are they the same person? (Use a hyphen: the parent-instructor.)\nIn circumstances involving a distinction or disjunction, the en dash (see above) is usually preferable to the slash: the digital\u2013analog distinction.\nAn unspaced slash may be used:\nA spaced slash may be used:\nTo avoid awkward linebreaks, code spaced slashes (and fraction slashes) with a non-breaking space on the left and a normal space on the right, as in: My mama told me&nbsp;/ You better shop around. For short constructions, both spaces should be non-breaking: x&nbsp;/&nbsp;y. On the other hand, if two long words are connected by an unspaced slash, an {{wbr}} added after the slash will allow a linebreak at that point.\nDo not use the backslash character (\u00a0\\\u00a0) in place of a slash.\nPrefer the division operator (\u00a0\u00f7\u00a0) to slash or fraction slash when representing elementary arithmetic in general text: 10 \u00f7 2 = 5. In more advanced mathematical formulas, a vinculum or slash is preferred: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\nn\n\n\n\nn\n!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\textstyle {\\frac {x^{n}}{n!}}}\n\n or xn/n! (see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers \u00a7\u00a0Common mathematical symbols and Help:Displaying a formula).\nAvoid writing and/or unless other constructions would be lengthy or awkward. Instead of Most had trauma and/or smoke inhalation, write simply trauma or smoke inhalation (which would normally be interpreted as an inclusive-or to imply or both); or, for emphasis or precision or both, write trauma or smoke inhalation or both. Where more than two possibilities are present, instead of x, y, and/or\u00a0z write one or more of x, y, and\u00a0z or some or all of x, y, and\u00a0z.\nAvoid using the # symbol (known as the number sign, hash sign, pound sign, or octothorpe) when referring to numbers or rankings. Instead write number, No. or Nos.; do not use the symbol \u2116. For example:\nAn exception is issue numbers of comic books, which unlike for other periodicals are conventionally given in general text in the form #1, unless a volume is also given, in which case write volume two, number seven or Vol. 2, No. 7. Another exception are periodical publications carrying both, issue and number designations (typically one being a year-relative and the other an absolute value); they should be given in the form 2 #143 in citations, or be spelt out as\nIss. 2, No. 143 in text. When using the abbreviations, write {{abbr|Vol.|Volume}}, {{abbr|Iss.|Issue}}, {{abbr|No.|Number}}, or {{abbr|Nos.|Numbers}}, at first occurrence.\nIn normal text, never put a space before a comma, semicolon, colon, period/full stop, question mark, or exclamation mark (even in quoted material; see \u00a7\u00a0Typographic conformity).\nSome editors place two spaces after a period/full stop (see Sentence spacing); these are condensed to one space when the page is rendered, so it does not affect what readers see.\nWhere a word or phrase that includes terminal punctuation ends a sentence, do not add a second terminal punctuation mark. If a quoted phrase or title ends in a question mark or exclamation mark, it may confuse readers as to the nature of the article sentence containing it, and so is usually better reworded to be mid-sentence. Where such a word or phrase occurs mid-sentence, new terminal punctuation (usually a period) must be added at the end.\nRef tags (<ref>...</ref>) are used to create footnotes (sometimes called endnotes or just notes), as citation footnotes and sometimes explanatory notes. All ref tags should immediately follow the text to which the footnote applies, with no intervening space.[s] Refs are placed after adjacent punctuation, not before (apart from the exceptions below). Adjacent ref tags should have no space between them, nor should there be any between ref tags and inline dispute/cleanup templates.\nWhen ref tags are used, a footnote list must be added, and this is usually placed in the References section, near the end of the article in the standard appendices and footers.\nExceptions: Ref tags are placed before dashes, not after. Where a footnote applies only to material within parentheses, the ref tags belong just before the closing parenthesis.\nA sentence that ends with a formula should have terminal punctuation (period, exclamation mark, or question mark) after the formula. Within a sentence, place other punctuation (such as commas or colons) after the formula just as if the text were not a formula. See Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Mathematics \u00a7\u00a0Punctuation after formulae.\nFor ranges of dates and times, see \u00a7\u00a0En dashes: other uses.\nDates should be linked only when they are germane and topical to the subject, as discussed at Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Linking \u00a7\u00a0Chronological items.\nTimes of day are normally expressed in figures rather than words. Context determines whether the 12- or the 24-hour format is more appropriate.\nFull dates are formatted 10 June 1921 or June 10, 1921; or where the year is omitted, use 10 June or June 10.\nMore information on all the above topics can be found at Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers \u00a7\u00a0Chronological items, including the handling of dates expressed in different calendars, and times corresponding to different time zones.\nTerms such as \"current\", \"now\", and \"recent\"[i] should be avoided. What is current today may not be tomorrow; situations change over time. Instead, use date- and time-specific text. To help keep information updated use {{As of}}, which will allow editors to catalog and update dated statements.\nFor the possessive of singular nouns, including proper names and words ending in s, add 's (my daughter's achievement, my niece's wedding, Cortez's men, the boss's office, Illinois's largest employer, Descartes's philosophy, Verreaux's eagle). Exception: abstract nouns ending with an /s/ sound when followed by sake (for goodness' sake, for his conscience' sake). If a name ending in s or z would be difficult to pronounce with 's added (Jesus's teachings), consider rewording (the teachings of Jesus).\nOfficial names (of companies, organizations, or places) should not be altered. (St Thomas' Hospital should therefore not be rendered as St Thomas's Hospital or St. Thomas Hospital, even for consistency.)\nTo maintain an objective and impersonal encyclopedic voice, an article should never refer to its editors or readers using I, my, we, us, our, or similar forms: We note that some believe that bats are bugs. But some such forms are acceptable in certain figurative uses. For example:\nAvoid addressing the reader using you or your, which sets an inappropriate tone (see also \u00a7\u00a0Instructional and presumptuous language).\nUse the appropriate plural; allow for cases (such as excursus or hanif) in which a word is now listed in major English dictionaries, and normally takes an s or es plural, not its original plural: two excursuses, not two excursus as in Latin; three hanifs, not three hunafa as in Arabic.\nSome collective nouns\u00a0\u2013 such as team (and proper names of them), army, company, crowd, fleet, government, majority, mess, number, pack, and party\u00a0\u2013 may refer either to a single entity or to the members that compose it. In British English, such words are sometimes treated as singular, but more often treated as plural, according to context. Exceptionally, names of towns and countries usually take singular verbs (unless they are being used to refer to a team or company by that name, or when discussing actions of that entity's government). For example, in England are playing Germany tonight but the team are a bit worried about their goalkeeper, England refers to a football team; but in England is the most populous country of the United Kingdom, it refers to the country. In North American English, these words (and the United States, for historical reasons) are almost invariably treated as singular; the major exception is when a sports team is referred to by its short name, plural verbs are commonly used to match e.g., the Heat are playing the Lakers tonight and the team needs a win. See also \u00a7\u00a0National varieties of English including \u00a7\u00a0Opportunities for commonality.\nBy default, write articles in the present tense, including those covering works of fiction (see Wikipedia:Writing better articles \u00a7\u00a0Tense in fiction) and products or works that have been discontinued. Generally, use past tense only for past events, and for subjects that are dead or no longer meaningfully exist. Use past tense for articles about periodicals no longer produced, with common-sense exceptions.\nTense can be used to distinguish between current and former status of a subject: D\u00fan Aonghasa is the ruin of a prehistoric Irish cliff fort. Its original shape was presumably oval or D-shaped, but parts of the cliff and fort have since collapsed into the sea. (Emphasis added to distinguish the different tense usages; D\u00fan Aonghasa is a structure that was later damaged by an event.)\nAlways use present tense for verbs that describe genres, types and classes, even if the subject of the description (e.g. program, library, device) no longer exists, is discontinued or is unsupported/unmaintained.\nAvoid contractions, which have little place in formal writing. For example, write do not instead of don't. Use of o'clock is an exception. Contracted titles such as Dr. and St generally should not be used but may apply in some contexts (e.g., quoted material, place names, titles of works).\nUse gender-neutral language \u2013 avoiding the generic he and generic she, for example \u2013 if this can be done with clarity and precision. This does not apply to direct quotations or the titles of works (The Ascent of Man), which should not be altered, or to wording about one-gender contexts, such as an all-female school (When any student breaks that rule, she loses privileges).\nReferences to space programs, past, present and future, should use gender-neutral phrasing: human spaceflight, robotic probe, uncrewed mission, crewed spacecraft, piloted, unpiloted, astronaut, cosmonaut, not manned or unmanned. Direct quotations and proper nouns that use gendered words should not be changed, like Manned Maneuvering Unit.\nShips may be referred to using either neuter forms (\"it\", \"its\") or feminine forms (\"she\", \"her\", \"hers\"). Either usage is acceptable, but each article should be internally consistent and employ one or the other exclusively. As with all optional styles, articles should not be changed from one style to another unless there is a substantial reason to do so. See Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Military history \u00a7\u00a0Pronouns.\nAvoid words and phrases that give the impression of straining for formality, that are unnecessarily regional, or that are not widely accepted. See List of commonly misused English words; see also \u00a7\u00a0Identity.\nAvoid phrases such as remember that and note that, which address readers directly in an unencyclopedic tone and lean toward instructional. They are a subtle form of Wikipedia self-reference, \"breaking the fourth wall\". Similarly, phrases such as of course, naturally, obviously, clearly, and actually make presumptions about readers' knowledge, may express a viewpoint, and may call into question the reason for including the information in the first place. Do not tell readers that something is interesting, ironic, surprising, unexpected, amusing, coincidental, etc. Simply present sourced facts neutrally and allow readers to draw their own conclusions. Such constructions can usually just be deleted, leaving behind proper sentences with a more academic and less pushy tone: Note that this was naturally subject to controversy in more conservative newspapers. becomes This was subject to controversy in more conservative newspapers.\nAvoid rhetorical questions, especially in headings. Use a heading of Active listening and text such as The term active listening, coined in\u00a0..., not What is active listening?\nFor issues in the use of cross-references\u00a0\u2013 e.g., (see also Bulverism)\u00a0\u2013 see #Second-person pronouns.\nA subset term identifies a set of members of a larger class. Common subset terms are including, among, and etc. Avoid redundant subset terms (e.g., mis-constructions like Among the most well-known members of the fraternity are included two members of the Onassis family or The elements in stars include hydrogen, helium, etc.). The word including does not introduce a complete list; instead, use consisting of, or composed of.\nWhen there is a discrepancy between the term most commonly used by reliable sources for a person or group and the term that person or group uses for themselves, use the term that is most commonly used by recent[i] reliable sources. If it is unclear which is most used, use the term that the person or group uses.\nDisputes over how to refer to a person or group are addressed by Wikipedia content policies, such as those on verifiability, and neutral point of view (and article titles when the term appears in the title of an article).\nUse specific terminology. For example, it is often more appropriate for people or things from Ethiopia (a country in Africa) to be described as Ethiopian, not carelessly (with the risk of stereotyping) as African.\nSpecific guidelines apply to any person whose gender might be questioned, and any living transgender or non-binary person. In summary:\nFor examples and finer points, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Biography \u00a7\u00a0Gender identity.\nForeign terms should be used sparingly.\nUse italics for phrases in other languages and for isolated foreign words that are not current in English (except certain cases in other guidance). Where possible, this is best done with the {{lang}} template using the appropriate ISO language code, e.g., {{lang|es|casa}}. This does not apply to foreign names of people or places. There are alternatives to the {{lang}} template which also provide additional information about a foreign word or phrase, such as a link to the language name; see Category:Wikipedia multilingual support templates. The {{lang}} template and related templates automatically italicize text for Latin-alphabet scripts, so do not add separate italics markup around or within them. Non-Latin-based scripts like Chinese should not be italicized, since it is already obvious the material cannot be English, and some such scripts do not support italicization.\nLoanwords and borrowed phrases that have common usage in English\u00a0\u2013 Gestapo, samurai, vice versa\u00a0\u2013 do not require italics. A rule of thumb is to not italicize words that appear in major general-purpose English-language dictionaries.\nNames not originally written in one of the Latin-script alphabets (written for example in Greek, Cyrillic, or Chinese scripts) must be given a romanized form for use in English. Use a systematically transliterated or otherwise romanized name (Aleksandr Tymoczko, Wang Yanhong); but if there is a more common English form of the name (Tchaikovsky, Chiang Kai-shek), use that form instead.\nThe use of diacritics (such as accent marks) for foreign words is neither encouraged nor discouraged; their usage depends on whether they appear in verifiable reliable sources in English, and on the constraints imposed by specialized Wikipedia guidelines. Provide redirects from alternative forms that use or exclude diacritics.\nProper names in languages which use the Latin alphabet can include characters with diacritics, ligatures, and others that are not commonly used in present-day English. Wikipedia normally retains these special characters, except where there is a well-established English spelling that replaces them with English standard letters. Examples:\nSuch matters are determined on a topic-by-topic basis; a small group of editors cannot \"prohibit\" or \"require\" diacritics across a category of articles.[u]\nSpell a name consistently in the title and the text of an article. (Relevant policy: Wikipedia:Article titles; see also Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English).) For a foreign name, phrase, or word, adopt the spelling most commonly used in English-language reliable sources, including but not limited to those already cited in the article.[v] For punctuation of compounded forms, see relevant guidelines in \u00a7\u00a0Punctuation.\nA non-English proper name should generally not be italicized, unless it would be for some other reason; this is most commonly when it is the title of a major published work, as in Les Liaisons dangereuses; or when it is being compared in a words-as-words manner to another name for the same subject, e.g., Nuremberg (German: N\u00fcrnberg). When the name should not be italicized, language markup can still be used to ensure proper pronunciation in screen readers, with the |italic=unset parameter: {{lang|de|italic=unset|N\u00fcrnberg}}.\nSometimes usage will be influenced by other guidelines, such as \u00a7\u00a0National varieties of English, which may lead to different choices in different articles.\nSome topics are intrinsically technical, but editors should try to make them understandable to as many readers as possible. Minimize jargon, or at least explain it or tag it using {{Technical}} or {{Technical-statement}} for other editors to fix. For unavoidably technical articles, a separate introductory article (like Introduction to general relativity) may be the best solution.\nAvoid excessive wikilinking (linking within Wikipedia) as a substitute for parenthetic explanations such as the one in this sentence. Do not introduce new and specialized words simply to teach them to the reader when more common alternatives will do.\nWhen the notions named by jargon are too complex to explain concisely in a few parenthetical words, write one level down. For example, consider adding a brief background section with {{main}} tags pointing to the full treatment article(s) of the prerequisite notions; this approach is practical only when the prerequisite concepts are central to the exposition of the article's main topic and when such prerequisites are not too numerous. Short articles, such as stubs, generally do not have such sections.\nFor italicization and other markup of introduced terms, see: Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting \u00a7\u00a0Words as words.\nGeographical or place names are the nouns used to refer to specific places and geographic features. These names often give rise to conflict, because the same places are called different things by different peoples speaking different languages. Many place names have a historical context that should be preserved, but common sense should prevail. There can be few places that have not been parts of more than one culture or have had only one name. As proper nouns, all such place names (but not terms for types of places) have major words capitalized.\nA place should generally be referred to consistently by the same name as in the title of its article (see Wikipedia:Naming conventions (geographic names)). An exception may be made when there is a widely accepted historical English name appropriate to the given context. In cases where such a historical name is used, it should be followed by the modern[i] name in round brackets (parentheses) on the first occurrence of the name in applicable sections of the article. This resembles linking; it should not be done to the detriment of style. On the other hand, it is probably better to provide such a variant too often than too rarely. If more than one historical name is applicable for a given context, the other names should be added after the modern English name, that is: \"historical name (modern name, other historical names)\".\nThis is an English-language encyclopedia, so established English names are preferred if they exist, and spellings in non-English alphabets should always be transcribed into the Roman alphabet. In general, other articles should refer to places by the names which are used in the articles on those places, according to the rules described at Wikipedia:Naming conventions (geographic names). If a different name is appropriate in a given historical or other context, then that may be used instead, although it is normal to follow the first occurrence of such a name with the standard modern name in parentheses.\nAt the start of an article, provide notable equivalent names from other languages, including transcriptions where necessary:\nNames in languages with no particular present-day or historical ties to the place in question (English excepted, of course) should not be listed as alternatives.\nAvoid anachronism. An article about Jun\u00edpero Serra should say he lived in Alta Mexico, not in California, because the latter entity did not yet exist in Serra's time. The Romans invaded Gaul, not France, and Thabo Mbeki was the president of the Republic of South Africa, not of the Cape Colony. To be clear, you may sometimes need to mention the current name of the area (for example \"in what is now France\"), especially if no English name exists for that area in the relevant historical period.\nOther media files include video and audio files. Style recommendations for such files largely follow recommendations for image files (as far as applicable).\nTextual information should almost always be entered as text rather than as an image. True text can be colored and adjusted with CSS tags and templates, but text in images cannot be. Images are not searchable, are slower to download, and are unlikely to be read as text by devices for the visually impaired. Any important textual information in an image should also appear in the image's alt text, caption, or other nearby text.\nFor entering textual information as audio, see Wikipedia:WikiProject Spoken Wikipedia.\nPhotographs and other graphics should have captions, unless they are unambiguous depictions of the subject of the article or when they are \"self-captioning\" images (such as reproductions of album or book covers). In a biography article no caption is necessary for a portrait of the subject pictured alone, but one might be used to give the year, the subject's age, or other circumstances of the portrait along with the name of the subject.\nMake links only where they are relevant and helpful in the context: Excessive use of hyperlinks can be distracting and may slow the reader down. Redundant links (like the one in the tallest people on Earth) clutter the page and make future maintenance harder. High-value links that are worth pursuing should stand out clearly.\nLinking to sections: A hash sign\u00a0(#) followed by the appropriate heading will lead to a relevant part of a page. For example, [[Apostrophe#Use in non-English names]] links to a particular section of the article Apostrophe.\nInitial capitalization: Wikipedia's MediaWiki software does not require that wikilinks begin with an upper-case character. Capitalize the first letter only where this is naturally called for, or when specifically referring to the linked article by its name (see also related rule for italics in cross-references): Snakes are often venomous, but lizards only rarely (see Poison).\nCheck links: Ensure the destination is the intended one; many dictionary words lead to disambiguation pages and not to complete or well-chosen articles.\nExternal links should not normally be used in the body of an article. Instead, articles can include an External links section at the end, pointing to further information outside Wikipedia as distinct from citing sources. The standard format is a primary heading, ==External links==, followed by a bulleted list of links. Identify the link and briefly indicate its relevance to the article. For example:\nThese will appear as:\nWhere appropriate, use external link templates such as {{Official website}} and {{URL}}.\nAdd external links with discretion; Wikipedia is not a link repository.\nOther things being equal, keep markup simple. This makes wikitext easier to understand and edit, and the results seen by the reader more predictable. Use HTML and CSS markup sparingly. See: KISS principle.\nIn general, wikitext formatting is considered easier to use than HTML and wikitext is preferred if there are equivalents; see Help:HTML in wikitext. Obsolete elements and attributes should be updated or removed. There are many templates that allow HTML markup to be used without putting it in articles directly, such as {{em}} (see MOS:EMPHASIS) and {{strong}} (see MOS:BOLD).\nAn HTML character entity is sometimes better than the equivalent Unicode character, which may be difficult to identify in edit mode; for example, &Alpha; is explicit whereas \u0391 (the upper-case form of Greek \u03b1) may be misidentified as the Latin A.\nModifications in font size, blank space, and color (see \u00a7\u00a0Color coding) are an issue for the Wikipedia site-wide style sheet and should be reserved for special cases only.\nTypically, the use of custom font styles will:\nSpecify font sizes relatively (for example with font-size: 85%) rather than absolutely (like font-size: 8pt). The resulting font size of any text should not drop below 85% of the page's default font size.\nDo not use color alone to mark differences in text: they may be invisible to people with color blindness and useless in black-and-white printouts or displays.\nChoose colors such as maroon and teal that are distinguishable by readers with the most common form of colorblindness, and additionally mark the differences with change of font or some other means (maroon and alternative font face, teal). Avoid low contrast between text and background colors. See also color coding.\nEven for readers with unimpaired color vision, excessive background shading of table entries impedes readability and recognition of Wikilinks. Background color should be used only as a supplementary visual cue and should be subtle (consider using lighter, less-dominant pastel hues) rather than glaring.\nDo not abuse block quotation markup to indent non-quotations. Various templates are available for indentation, including {{block indent}} and (for inline use) {{in5}}.\nAvoid : (description list markup) for simple visual indentation in articles (common as it may be on talk pages). It causes accessibility problems and outputs invalid HTML. See Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility \u00a7\u00a0Indentation for alternatives.\nIt is sometimes desirable to force a text segment to appear entirely on a single line\u200d\u2014\u200cthat is, to prevent a line break (line wrap) from occurring anywhere within it.\nIt is desirable to prevent line breaks where breaking across lines might be confusing or awkward. For example:\nWhether a non-breaking space is appropriate depends on context: whereas it is appropriate to use 12{{nbsp}}MB in prose, it may be counterproductive in a table (where an unattractive break may be acceptable to conserve precious horizontal space) and unnecessary in a short parameter value in an infobox (where a break would never occur anyway).\nA line break may occur at a thin space (&thinsp;, or {{thinsp}}), which is sometimes used to correct too-close placement of adjacent characters. To prevent this, consider using {{nobr}}.\nInsert non-breaking and thin spaces as named character reference (&nbsp; or &thinsp;), or as templates that generate these ({{nbsp}}, {{thinsp}}), and never by entering them directly into the edit window from the keyboard\u00a0\u2013 they are visually indistinguishable from regular spaces, and later editors will be unable to see what they are. Inside wikilinks, a construction such as [[World War&nbsp;II]] works but [[World War{{nbsp}}II]] doesn't.\nScrolling lists, and collapsible templates that toggle text display between hide and show, can interfere with readers' ability to access our content. Such mechanisms should not be used to conceal \"spoiler\" information. Templates should not normally be used to store article text at all, as it interferes with editors' ability to find and edit it.\nWhen such features are used, take care that the content will still be accessible on devices that do not support JavaScript or CSS, and to the greater than 60% of Wikipedia readers who use the mobile version of the site,[w] which has a limited set of features and does not support collapsing (any collapsible templates will either be automatically uncollapsed or hidden entirely). Mobile ability to access the content in question is easy to test with the \"Mobile view\" link at the bottom of each page.[x]\nCollapsible templates should not conceal article content by default upon page loading. This includes reference lists, tables and lists of article content, image galleries, and image captions.\nWhen hiding content is desired, it must be done using the collapsible parameter of relevant templates, or manually-added CSS classes mw-collapsed, and autocollapse (see Help:Collapsing). Other methods of hiding content should not be used, as they may render content inaccessible to many users, such as those browsing Wikipedia with JavaScript disabled, browsing the mobile version[y], or using proxy services such as Google Web Light.\nCollapsed or auto-collapsing cells or sections may be used with tables if they simply repeat information covered in the main text (or are purely supplementary, e.g., several past years of statistics in collapsed tables for comparison with a table of uncollapsed current stats). Auto-collapsing is often a feature of navboxes. A few infoboxes also use pre-collapsed sections for infrequently accessed details. If information in a list, infobox, or other non-navigational content seems extraneous or trivial enough to inspire pre-collapsing it, consider raising a discussion on the article (or template) talk page about whether it should be included at all. If the information is important and the concern is article density or length, consider dividing the article into more sections, integrating unnecessarily list-formatted information into the article prose, or splitting the article.\nEditors use \"invisible\" comments\u00a0\u2013 not shown in the rendered page seen by readers of the article, but visible in the source editing mode when an editor opens the article for editing\u00a0\u2013 to communicate with one another.\nInvisible comments are useful for alerting other editors to issues such as common mistakes that regularly occur in the article, a section title's being the target of an incoming link, or pointing to a discussion that established a consensus relating to the article. They should not be used to instruct other editors not to perform certain edits, although where existing local consensus is against making such an edit, they may usefully draw the editor's attention to that. Avoid adding too many invisible comments because they can clutter the wiki source for other editors. Check that your invisible comment does not change the formatting, for example by introducing unwanted white space in the rendered page.\nTo leave an invisible comment, enclose the text you intend to be read only by editors between <!-- and -->. For example:\nThis notation can be inserted with a single click in wiki markup, just under the edit pane in edit mode.\nPronunciation in Wikipedia is indicated in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). In most situations, for ease of understanding by the majority of readers and across variants of the language, quite broad IPA transcriptions are best for English pronunciations. See Help:IPA/English and Help:IPA (general) for keys, and {{IPA}} for templates that link to these keys. For English pronunciations, pronunciation respellings may be used in addition to the IPA.\n(Links to policy and guidelines on specific questions)\nWikipedians are encouraged to familiarize themselves with modern editions of other guides to style and usage, which may cover details not included here.

Wikipedia": {"text": "The University of Oxford is a collegiate research university in Oxford, England. There is evidence of teaching as early as 1096,[2] making it the oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world's second-oldest university in continuous operation.[2][9][10] It grew rapidly from 1167 when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris.[2] After disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled north-east to Cambridge where they established what became the University of Cambridge.[11] The two English ancient universities share many common features and are jointly referred to as Oxbridge.\nThe university is made up of thirty-nine semi-autonomous constituent colleges, five permanent private halls, and a range of academic departments which are organised into four divisions.[12] All the colleges are self-governing institutions within the university, each controlling its own membership and with its own internal structure and activities. All students are members of a college.[13] It does not have a main campus, and its buildings and facilities are scattered throughout the city centre. Undergraduate teaching at Oxford consists of lectures, small-group tutorials at the colleges and halls, seminars, laboratory work and occasionally further tutorials provided by the central university faculties and departments. Postgraduate teaching is provided predominantly centrally.\nOxford operates the world's oldest university museum, as well as the largest university press in the world and the largest academic library system nationwide.[14] In the fiscal year ending 31 July 2019, the university had a total income of \u00a32.45\u00a0billion, of which \u00a3624.8\u00a0million was from research grants and contracts.[3]\nOxford has educated a wide range of notable alumni, including 30 prime ministers of the United Kingdom and many heads of state and government around the world.[15] As of October 2022,[update] 73 Nobel Prize laureates, 4 Fields Medalists, and 6 Turing Award winners have studied, worked, or held visiting fellowships at the University of Oxford, while its alumni have won 160 Olympic medals.[16] Oxford is the home of numerous scholarships, including the Rhodes Scholarship, one of the oldest international graduate scholarship programmes.\nThe University of Oxford's foundation date is unknown.[17] It is known that teaching at Oxford existed in some form as early as 1096, but it is unclear when the university came into being.[2] The scholar  Theobald of \u00c9tampes lectured at Oxford in the early 1100s.\nIt grew quickly from 1167 when English students returned from the University of Paris.[2] The historian Gerald of Wales lectured to such scholars in 1188, and the first known foreign scholar, Emo of Friesland, arrived in 1190. The head of the university had the title of chancellor from at least 1201, and the masters were recognised as a universitas or corporation in 1231.[2][18] The university was granted a royal charter in 1248 during the reign of King Henry III.[19]\nAfter disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled from the violence to Cambridge, later forming the University of Cambridge.[11][20]\nThe students associated together on the basis of geographical origins, into two 'nations', representing the North (northerners or Boreales, who included the English people from north of the River Trent and the Scots) and the South (southerners or Australes, who included English people from south of the Trent, the Irish and the Welsh).[21][22] In later centuries, geographical origins continued to influence many students' affiliations when membership of a college or hall became customary in Oxford. In addition, members of many religious orders, including Dominicans, Franciscans, Carmelites and Augustinians, settled in Oxford in the mid-13th century, gained influence and maintained houses or halls for students.[23] At about the same time, private benefactors established colleges as self-contained scholarly communities. Among the earliest such founders were William of Durham, who in 1249 endowed University College,[23] and John Balliol, father of a future King of Scots; Balliol College bears his name.[21] Another founder, Walter de Merton, a Lord Chancellor of England and afterwards Bishop of Rochester, devised a series of regulations for college life;[24][25] Merton College thereby became the model for such establishments at Oxford,[26] as well as at the University of Cambridge. Thereafter, an increasing number of students lived in colleges rather than in halls and religious houses.[23]\nIn 1333\u20131334, an attempt by some dissatisfied Oxford scholars to found a new university at Stamford, Lincolnshire, was blocked by the universities of Oxford and Cambridge petitioning King Edward III.[27] Thereafter, until the 1820s, no new universities were allowed to be founded in England, even in London; thus, Oxford and Cambridge had a duopoly, which was unusual in large western European countries.[28][29]\nThe new learning of the Renaissance greatly influenced Oxford from the late 15th century onwards. Among university scholars of the period were William Grocyn, who contributed to the revival of Greek language studies,[30] and John Colet, the noted biblical scholar.[31]\nWith the English Reformation and the breaking of communion with the Roman Catholic Church, recusant scholars from Oxford fled to continental Europe, settling especially at the University of Douai.[32] The method of teaching at Oxford was transformed from the medieval scholastic method to Renaissance education, although institutions associated with the university suffered losses of land and revenues. As a centre of learning and scholarship, Oxford's reputation declined in the Age of Enlightenment; enrolments fell and teaching was neglected.[citation needed]\nIn 1636,[33] William Laud, the chancellor and Archbishop of Canterbury, codified the university's statutes. These, to a large extent, remained its governing regulations until the mid-19th century. Laud was also responsible for the granting of a charter securing privileges for the University Press, and he made significant contributions to the Bodleian Library, the main library of the university. From the beginnings of the Church of England as the established church until 1866, membership of the church was a requirement to receive the BA degree from the university and \"dissenters\" were only permitted to receive the MA in 1871.[34]\nThe university was a centre of the Royalist party during the English Civil War (1642\u20131649), while the town favoured the opposing Parliamentarian cause.[35] From the mid-18th century onwards, however, the university took little part in political conflicts.[citation needed]\nWadham College, founded in 1610, was the undergraduate college of Sir Christopher Wren.\nWren was part of a brilliant group of experimental scientists at Oxford in the 1650s, the Oxford Philosophical Club, which included Robert Boyle and Robert Hooke. This group, which has at times been linked with Boyle's \"Invisible College\" held regular meetings at Wadham under the guidance of the college's Warden, John Wilkins, and the group formed the nucleus that went on to found the Royal Society.[36]\nBefore reforms in the early 19th century, the curriculum at Oxford was notoriously narrow and impractical. Sir Spencer Walpole, a historian of contemporary Britain and a senior government official, had not attended any university. He said, \"Few medical men, few solicitors, few persons intended for commerce or trade, ever dreamed of passing through a university career.\" He quoted the Oxford University Commissioners in 1852 stating: \"The education imparted at Oxford was not such as to conduce to the advancement in life of many persons, except those intended for the ministry.\"[37] Nevertheless, Walpole argued:\nAmong the many deficiencies attending a university education there was, however, one good thing about it, and that was the education which the undergraduates gave themselves. It was impossible to collect some thousand or twelve hundred of the best young men in England, to give them the opportunity of making acquaintance with one another, and full liberty to live their lives in their own way, without evolving in the best among them, some admirable qualities of loyalty, independence, and self-control. If the average undergraduate carried from University little or no learning, which was of any service to him, he carried from it a knowledge of men and respect for his fellows and himself, a reverence for the past, a code of honour for the present, which could not but be serviceable. He had enjoyed opportunities... of intercourse with men, some of whom were certain to rise to the highest places in the Senate, in the Church, or at the Bar. He might have mixed with them in his sports, in his studies, and perhaps in his debating society; and any associations which he had this formed had been useful to him at the time, and might be a source of satisfaction to him in after life.[38]\nOut of the students who matriculated in 1840, 65% were sons of professionals (34% were Anglican ministers). After graduation, 87% became professionals (59% as Anglican clergy). Out of the students who matriculated in 1870, 59% were sons of professionals (25% were Anglican ministers). After graduation, 87% became professionals (42% as Anglican clergy).[39][40]\nM.\u00a0C. Curthoys and H.\u00a0S. Jones argue that the rise of organised sport was one of the most remarkable and distinctive features of the history of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was carried over from the athleticism prevalent at the public schools such as Eton, Winchester, Shrewsbury, and Harrow.[41]\nAll students, regardless of their chosen area of study, were required to spend (at least) their first year preparing for a first-year examination that was heavily focused on classical languages. Science students found this particularly burdensome and supported a separate science degree with Greek language study removed from their required courses. This concept of a Bachelor of Science had been adopted at other European universities (London University had implemented it in 1860) but an 1880 proposal at Oxford to replace the classical requirement with a modern language (like German or French) was unsuccessful. After considerable internal wrangling over the structure of the arts curriculum, in 1886 the \"natural science preliminary\" was recognized as a qualifying part of the first year examination.[42]\nAt the start of 1914, the university housed about 3,000 undergraduates and about 100 postgraduate students. During the First World War, many undergraduates and fellows joined the armed forces. By 1918 virtually all fellows were in uniform, and the student population in residence was reduced to 12 per cent of the pre-war total.[43] The University Roll of Service records that, in total, 14,792 members of the university served in the war, with 2,716 (18.36%) killed.[44] Not all the members of the university who served in the Great War were on the Allied side; there is a remarkable memorial to members of New College who served in the German armed forces, bearing the inscription, 'In memory of the men of this college who coming from a foreign land entered into the inheritance of this place and returning fought and died for their country in the war 1914\u20131918'. During the war years the university buildings became hospitals, cadet schools and military training camps.[43]\nTwo parliamentary commissions in 1852 issued recommendations for Oxford and Cambridge. Archibald Campbell Tait, former headmaster of Rugby School, was a key member of the Oxford Commission; he wanted Oxford to follow the German and Scottish model in which the professorship was paramount. The commission's report envisioned a centralised university run predominantly by professors and faculties, with a much stronger emphasis on research. The professional staff should be strengthened and better paid. For students, restrictions on entry should be dropped, and more opportunities given to poorer families. It called for an enlargement of the curriculum, with honours to be awarded in many new fields. Undergraduate scholarships should be open to all Britons. Graduate fellowships should be opened up to all members of the university. It recommended that fellows be released from an obligation for ordination. Students were to be allowed to save money by boarding in the city, instead of in a college.[45][46]\nThe system of separate honour schools for different subjects began in 1802, with Mathematics and Literae Humaniores.[47] Schools of \"Natural Sciences\" and \"Law, and Modern History\" were added in 1853.[47] By 1872, the last of these had split into \"Jurisprudence\" and \"Modern History\". Theology became the sixth honour school.[48] In addition to these B.A. Honours degrees, the postgraduate Bachelor of Civil Law (B.C.L.) was, and still is, offered.[49]\nThe mid-19th century saw the impact of the Oxford Movement (1833\u20131845), led among others by the future Cardinal John Henry Newman. The influence of the reformed model of German universities reached Oxford via key scholars such as Edward Bouverie Pusey, Benjamin Jowett and Max M\u00fcller.[citation needed]\nAdministrative reforms during the 19th century included the replacement of oral examinations with written entrance tests, greater tolerance for religious dissent, and the establishment of four women's colleges. Privy Council decisions in the 20th century (e.g. the abolition of compulsory daily worship, dissociation of the Regius Professorship of Hebrew from clerical status, diversion of colleges' theological bequests to other purposes) loosened the link with traditional belief and practice. Furthermore, although the university's emphasis had historically been on classical knowledge, its curriculum expanded during the 19th century to include scientific and medical studies. Knowledge of Ancient Greek was required for admission until 1920, and Latin until 1960.[citation needed]\nThe University of Oxford began to award doctorates for research in the first third of the 20th century. The first Oxford DPhil in mathematics was awarded in 1921.[50]\nThe mid-20th century saw many distinguished continental scholars, displaced by Nazism and communism, relocating to Oxford.[citation needed]\nThe list of distinguished scholars at the University of Oxford is long and includes many who have made major contributions to politics, the sciences, medicine, and literature. As of October 2022, 73 Nobel laureates and more than 50 world leaders have been affiliated with the University of Oxford.[15]\nThe university passed a statute in 1875 allowing examinations for women at roughly undergraduate level;[51] for a brief period in the early 1900s, this allowed the \"steamboat ladies\" to receive ad eundem degrees from the University of Dublin.[52] In June 1878, the Association for the Education of Women (AEW) was formed, aiming for the eventual creation of a college for women in Oxford. Some of the more prominent members of the association were George Granville Bradley, T. H. Green and Edward Stuart Talbot. Talbot insisted on a specifically Anglican institution, which was unacceptable to most of the other members. The two parties eventually split, and Talbot's group founded Lady Margaret Hall in 1878, while T. H. Green founded the non-denominational Somerville College in 1879.[53] Lady Margaret Hall and Somerville opened their doors to their first 21 students (12 from Somerville, 9 from Lady Margaret Hall) in 1879, who attended lectures in rooms above an Oxford baker's shop.[51] There were also 25 women students living at home or with friends in 1879, a group which evolved into the Society of Oxford Home-Students and in 1952 into St Anne's College.[54][55]\nThese first three societies for women were followed by St Hugh's (1886)[56] and St Hilda's (1893).[57] All of these colleges later became coeducational, starting with Lady Margaret Hall and St Anne's in 1979,[58][59] and finishing with St Hilda's, which began to accept male students in 2008.[60] In the early 20th century, Oxford and Cambridge were widely perceived to be bastions of male privilege,[61] however the integration of women into Oxford moved forward during the First World War. In 1916 women were admitted as medical students on a par with men, and in 1917 the university accepted financial responsibility for women's examinations.[43]\nOn 7 October 1920 women became eligible for admission as full members of the university and were given the right to take degrees.[62] In 1927 the university's dons created a quota that limited the number of female students to a quarter that of men, a ruling which was not abolished until 1957.[51] However, during this period Oxford colleges were single sex, so the number of women was also limited by the capacity of the women's colleges to admit students. It was not until 1959 that the women's colleges were given full collegiate status.[63]\nIn 1974, Brasenose, Jesus, Wadham, Hertford and St Catherine's became the first previously all-male colleges to admit women.[64][65] The majority of men's colleges accepted their first female students in 1979,[65] with Christ Church following in 1980,[66] and Oriel becoming the last men's college to admit women in 1985.[67] Most of Oxford's graduate colleges were founded as coeducational establishments in the 20th century, with the exception of St Antony's, which was founded as a men's college in 1950 and began to accept women only in 1962.[68] By 1988, 40% of undergraduates at Oxford were female;[69] in 2016, 45% of the student population, and 47% of undergraduate students, were female.[70][71]\nIn June 2017, Oxford announced that starting the following academic year, history students may choose to sit a take-home exam in some courses, with the intention that this will equalise rates of firsts awarded to women and men at Oxford.[72] That same summer, maths and computer science tests were extended by 15 minutes, in a bid to see if female student scores would improve.[73][74]\nThe detective novel Gaudy Night by Dorothy L. Sayers, herself one of the first women to gain an academic degree from Oxford, is largely set in the all-female Shrewsbury College, Oxford (based on Sayers' own Somerville College[75]), and the issue of women's education is central to its plot. Social historian and Somerville College alumna Jane Robinson's book Bluestockings: A Remarkable History of the First Women to Fight for an Education gives a very detailed and immersive account of this history.[76]\nThe university is a \"city university\" in that it does not have a main campus; instead, colleges, departments, accommodation, and other facilities are scattered throughout the city centre. The Science Area, in which most science departments are located, is the area that bears closest resemblance to a campus. The ten-acre (4-hectare) Radcliffe Observatory Quarter in the northwest of the city is currently under development. However, the larger colleges' sites are of similar size to these areas.[citation needed]\nIconic university buildings include the Radcliffe Camera, the Sheldonian Theatre used for music concerts, lectures, and university ceremonies, and the Examination Schools, where examinations and some lectures take place. The University Church of St Mary the Virgin was used for university ceremonies before the construction of the Sheldonian. Christ Church Cathedral uniquely serves as both a college chapel and as a cathedral.[citation needed]\nIn 2012\u20132013, the university built the controversial one-hectare (400\u00a0m \u00d7 25\u00a0m) Castle Mill development of 4\u20135-storey blocks of student flats overlooking Cripley Meadow and the historic Port Meadow, blocking views of the spires in the city centre.[77] The development has been likened to building a \"skyscraper beside Stonehenge\".[78]\nThe University Parks are a 70-acre (28\u00a0ha) parkland area in the northeast of the city, near Keble College, Somerville College and Lady Margaret Hall. It is open to the public during daylight hours. As well as providing gardens and exotic plants, the Parks contains numerous sports fields, used for official and unofficial fixtures, and also contains sites of special interest including the Genetic Garden, an experimental garden to elucidate and investigate evolutionary processes.[citation needed]\nThe Botanic Garden on the High Street is the oldest botanic garden in the UK. It contains over 8,000 different plant species on 1.8\u00a0ha (4+1\u20442 acres). It is one of the most diverse yet compact major collections of plants in the world and includes representatives of over 90% of the higher plant families. The Harcourt Arboretum is a 130-acre (53\u00a0ha) site six miles (9.7\u00a0km) south of the city that includes native woodland and 67 acres (27 hectares) of meadow. The 1,000-acre (4.0\u00a0km2) Wytham Woods are owned by the university and used for research in zoology and climate change.[citation needed]\nThere are also various collegiate-owned open spaces open to the public, including Bagley Wood and most notably Christ Church Meadow.[79]\nAs a collegiate university, Oxford is structured as a federation, comprising over forty self-governing colleges and halls, along with a central administration headed by the Vice-Chancellor.[citation needed]\nAcademic departments are located centrally within the structure of the federation; they are not affiliated with any particular college. Departments provide facilities for teaching and research, determine the syllabi and guidelines for the teaching of students, perform research, and deliver lectures and seminars.[citation needed]\nColleges arrange the tutorial teaching for their undergraduates, and the members of an academic department are spread around many colleges. Though certain colleges do have subject alignments (e.g., Nuffield College as a centre for the social sciences), these are exceptions, and most colleges will have a broad mix of academics and students from a diverse range of subjects. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels: by the central university (the Bodleian), by the departments (individual departmental libraries, such as the English Faculty Library), and by colleges (each of which maintains a multi-discipline library for the use of its members).[citation needed]\nThe university's formal head is the Chancellor, currently Lord Patten of Barnes, though as at most British universities, the Chancellor is a titular figure and is not involved with the day-to-day running of the university. The Chancellor is elected by the members of Convocation, a body comprising all graduates of the university, and holds office until death.[80]\nThe Vice-Chancellor, currently Irene Tracey,[4] is the de facto head of the university. Five pro-vice-chancellors have specific responsibilities for education; research; planning and resources; development and external affairs; and personnel and equal opportunities. The University Council is the executive policy-forming body, which consists of the vice-chancellor as well as heads of departments and other members elected by Congregation, in addition to observers from the students' union. Congregation, the \"parliament of the dons\", comprises over 3,700 members of the university's academic and administrative staff, and has ultimate responsibility for legislative matters: it discusses and pronounces on policies proposed by the University Council.[citation needed]\nTwo university proctors, elected annually on a rotating basis from two of the colleges, are the internal ombudsmen who make sure that the university and its members adhere to its statutes. This role incorporates student discipline and complaints, as well as oversight of the university's proceedings.[81] The university's professors are collectively referred to as the Statutory Professors of the University of Oxford. They are particularly influential in the running of the university's graduate programmes. Examples of statutory professors are the Chichele Professorships and the Drummond Professor of Political Economy. The various academic faculties, departments, and institutes are organised into four divisions, each with its own head and elected board. They are the Humanities Division; the Social Sciences Division; the Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences Division; and the Medical Sciences Division.[citation needed]\nThe University of Oxford is a \"public university\" in the sense that it receives some public money from the government, but it is a \"private university\" in the sense that it is entirely self-governing and, in theory, could choose to become entirely private by rejecting public funds.[82]\nTo be a member of the university, all students, and most academic staff, must also be a member of a college or hall. There are thirty-nine colleges of the University of Oxford and five permanent private halls (PPHs), each controlling its membership and with its own internal structure and activities.[13] Not all colleges offer all courses, but they generally cover a broad range of subjects.\nThe colleges are:\nThe permanent private halls were founded by different Christian denominations. One difference between a college and a PPH is that whereas colleges are governed by the fellows of the college, the governance of a PPH resides, at least in part, with the corresponding Christian denomination. The five current PPHs are:\nThe PPHs and colleges join as the Conference of Colleges, which represents the common concerns of the several colleges of the university, to discuss matters of shared interest and to act collectively when necessary, such as in dealings with the central university.[83][84] The Conference of Colleges was established as a recommendation of the Franks Commission in 1965.[85]\nTeaching members of the colleges (i.e. fellows and tutors) are collectively and familiarly known as dons, although the term is rarely used by the university itself. In addition to residential and dining facilities, the colleges provide social, cultural, and recreational activities for their members. Colleges have responsibility for admitting undergraduates and organising their tuition; for graduates, this responsibility falls upon the departments. There is no common title for the heads of colleges: the titles used include Warden, Provost, Principal, President, Rector, Master and Dean.[citation needed]\nIn 2017\u201318, the university had an income of \u00a32,237m; key sources were research grants (\u00a3579.1m) and academic fees (\u00a3332.5m).[86] The colleges had a total income of \u00a3492.9m.[87]\nWhile the university has a larger annual income and operating budget, the colleges have a larger aggregate endowment: over \u00a34.9bn compared to the university's \u00a31.2bn.[3] The central University's endowment, along with some of the colleges', is managed by the university's wholly-owned endowment management office, Oxford University Endowment Management, formed in 2007.[88] The university used to maintain substantial investments in fossil fuel companies.[89] However, in April 2020, the university committed to divest from direct investments in fossil fuel companies and to require indirect investments in fossil fuel companies be subjected to the Oxford Martin Principles.[90][91]\nThe total assets of the colleges of \u00a36.3\u00a0billion also exceed total university assets of \u00a34.1\u00a0billion.[87][86] The college figure does not reflect all the assets held by the colleges as their accounts do not include the cost or value of many of their main sites or heritage assets such as works of art or libraries.[92]\nThe university was one of the first in the UK to raise money through a major public fundraising campaign, the Campaign for Oxford. The current campaign, its second, was launched in May 2008 and is entitled \"Oxford Thinking \u2013 The Campaign for the University of Oxford\".[93] This is looking to support three areas: academic posts and programmes, student support, and buildings and infrastructure;[94] having passed its original target of \u00a31.25\u00a0billion in March 2012, the target was raised to \u00a33\u00a0billion.[95] The campaign had raised a total of \u00a32.8\u00a0billion by July 2018.[86]\nThe university has faced criticism for some of its sources of donations and funding. In 2017, attention was drawn to historical donations including All Souls College receiving \u00a310,000 from slave trader Christopher Codrington in 1710,[96] and Oriel College having receiving taken \u00a3100,000 from the will of the imperialist Cecil Rhodes in 1902.[97][98] In 1996 a donation of \u00a320 million was received from Wafic Sa\u00efd who was involved in the Al-Yammah arms deal,[99][100] and taking \u00a3150 million from the US billionaire businessman Stephen A. Schwarzman in 2019.[101] The university has defended its decisions saying it \"takes legal, ethical and reputational issues into consideration.\"\nThe university has also faced criticism, as noted above, over its decision to accept donations from fossil fuel companies having received \u00a321.8 million from the fossil fuel industry between 2010 and 2015[102] and \u00a318.8 million between 2015 and 2020.[103][104]\nThe university accepted \u00a36 million from The Alexander Mosley Charitable Trust in 2021. Former racing driver Max Mosley claims to have set up the trust \"to house the fortune he inherited\" from his father,[105] Oswald Mosley, who was founder of two far right groups: Union Movement and the British Union of Fascists.[106]\nOxford is a member of the Russell Group of research-led British universities, the G5, the League of European Research Universities, and the International Alliance of Research Universities. It is also a core member of the Europaeum and forms part of the \"golden triangle\" of highly research intensive and elite English universities.[107]\nIn common with most British universities, prospective undergraduate students apply through the UCAS application system, but prospective applicants for the University of Oxford, along with those for medicine, dentistry, and University of Cambridge applicants, must observe an earlier deadline of 15 October.[120]  The Sutton Trust maintains that Oxford University and Cambridge University recruit undergraduates disproportionately from 8 schools which accounted for 1,310 Oxbridge places during three years, contrasted with 1,220 from 2,900 other schools.[121]\nTo allow a more personalised judgement of students, who might otherwise apply for both, undergraduate applicants are not permitted to apply to both Oxford and Cambridge in the same year. The only exceptions are applicants for organ scholarships[122] and those applying to read for a second undergraduate degree.[123]\nOxford has the lowest offer rate of all Russell Group universities.[124]\nMost applicants choose to apply to one of the individual colleges. For undergraduates, these colleges work with each other to ensure that the best students gain a place somewhere at the university regardless of their college preferences. For postgraduates, all applicants who receive an offer from the University are guaranteed a college place, even if they do not receive a place at their chosen college.[125]\nUndergraduate shortlisting is based on achieved and predicted exam results, school references, and, in some subjects, written admission tests or candidate-submitted written work. Approximately 60% of applicants are shortlisted, although this varies by subject. If a large number of shortlisted applicants for a subject choose one college, then students who named that college may be reallocated randomly to under-subscribed colleges for the subject. The colleges then invite shortlisted candidates for interview, where they are provided with food and accommodation for around three days in December. Most undergraduate applicants will be individually interviewed by academics at more than one college. Students from outside Europe can be interviewed remotely, for example, over the Internet.[citation needed]\nUndergraduate offers are sent out in early January, with each offer usually being from a specific college. One in four successful candidates receives an offer from a college that they did not apply to. Some courses may make \"open offers\" to some candidates, who are not assigned to a particular college until A Level results day in August.[126][127]\nThe university has come under criticism for the number of students it accepts from private schools;[128] for instance, Laura Spence's rejection from the university in 2000 led to widespread debate.[129] In 2016, the University of Oxford gave 59% of offers to UK students to students from state schools, while about 93% of all UK pupils and 86% of post-16 UK pupils are educated in state schools.[130][131][132] However, 64% of UK applicants were from state schools and the university notes that state school students apply disproportionately to oversubscribed subjects.[133] The proportion of students coming from state schools has been increasing. From 2015 to 2019, the state proportion of total UK students admitted each year was: 55.6%, 58.0%, 58.2%, 60.5% and 62.3%.[134] Oxford University spends over \u00a36\u00a0million per year on outreach programs to encourage applicants from underrepresented demographics.[130]\nIn 2018 the university's annual admissions report revealed that eight of Oxford's colleges had accepted fewer than three black applicants in the past three years.[135] Labour MP David Lammy said, \"This is social apartheid and it is utterly unrepresentative of life in modern Britain.\"[136] In 2020, Oxford had increased its proportion of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) students to record levels.[137][138] The number of BAME undergraduates accepted to the university in 2020 rose to 684 students, or 23.6% of the UK intake, up from 558 or 22% in 2019; the number of Black students was 106 (3.7% of the intake), up from 80 students (3.2%).[138][139] UCAS data also showed that Oxford is more likely than comparable institutions to make offers to ethnic minority and socially disadvantaged pupils.[137]\nUndergraduate teaching is centred on the tutorial, where 1\u20134 students spend an hour with an academic discussing their week's work, usually an essay (humanities, most social sciences, some mathematical, physical, and life sciences) or problem sheet (most mathematical, physical, and life sciences, and some social sciences). The university itself is responsible for conducting examinations and conferring degrees. Undergraduate teaching takes place during three eight-week academic terms: Michaelmas, Hilary and Trinity.[140] (These are officially known as 'Full Term': 'Term' is a lengthier period with little practical significance.) Internally, the weeks in a term begin on Sundays, and are referred to numerically, with the initial week known as \"first week\", the last as \"eighth week\" and with the numbering extended to refer to weeks before and after term (for example \"noughth week\" precedes term).[141] Undergraduates must be in residence from Thursday of 0th week. These teaching terms are shorter than those of most other British universities,[142] and their total duration amounts to less than half the year. However, undergraduates are also expected to do some academic work during the three holidays (known as the Christmas, Easter, and Long Vacations).\nResearch degrees at the master's and doctoral level are conferred in all subjects studied at graduate level at the university.[citation needed]\nThere are many opportunities for students at Oxford to receive financial help during their studies. The Oxford Opportunity Bursaries, introduced in 2006, are university-wide means-based bursaries available to any British undergraduate, with a total possible grant of \u00a310,235 over a 3-year degree. In addition, individual colleges also offer bursaries and funds to help their students. For graduate study, there are many scholarships attached to the university, available to students from all sorts of backgrounds, from Rhodes Scholarships to the relatively new Weidenfeld Scholarships.[143] Oxford also offers the Clarendon Scholarship which is open to graduate applicants of all nationalities.[144] The Clarendon Scholarship is principally funded by Oxford University Press in association with colleges and other partnership awards.[145][146] In 2016, Oxford University announced that it is to run its first free online economics course as part of a \"massive open online course\" (Mooc) scheme, in partnership with a US online university network.[147] The course available is called 'From Poverty to Prosperity: Understanding Economic Development'.\nStudents successful in early examinations are rewarded by their colleges with scholarships and exhibitions, normally the result of a long-standing endowment, although since the introduction of tuition fees the amounts of money available are purely nominal. Scholars, and exhibitioners in some colleges, are entitled to wear a more voluminous undergraduate gown; \"commoners\" (originally those who had to pay for their \"commons\", or food and lodging) are restricted to a short, sleeveless garment. The term \"scholar\" in relation to Oxford therefore has a specific meaning as well as the more general meaning of someone of outstanding academic ability. In previous times, there were \"noblemen commoners\" and \"gentlemen commoners\", but these ranks were abolished in the 19th century. \"Closed\" scholarships, available only to candidates who fitted specific conditions such as coming from specific schools, were abolished in the 1970s and 1980s.[148]\nThe university maintains the largest university library system in the UK,[14] and, with over 11\u00a0million volumes housed on 120 miles (190\u00a0km) of shelving, the Bodleian group is the second-largest library in the UK, after the British Library. The Bodleian is a legal deposit library, which means that it is entitled to request a free copy of every book published in the UK. As such, its collection is growing at a rate of over three miles (five kilometres) of shelving every year.[149]\nThe buildings referred to as the university's main research library, The Bodleian, consist of the original Bodleian Library in the Old Schools Quadrangle, founded by Sir Thomas Bodley in 1598 and opened in 1602,[150] the Radcliffe Camera, the Clarendon Building, and the Weston Library. A tunnel underneath Broad Street connects these buildings, with the Gladstone Link, which opened to readers in 2011, connecting the Old Bodleian and Radcliffe Camera.\nThe Bodleian Libraries group was formed in 2000, bringing the Bodleian Library and some of the subject libraries together.[151] It now comprises 28[152] libraries, a number of which have been created by bringing previously separate collections together, including the Sackler Library, Law Library, Social Science Library and Radcliffe Science Library.[151] Another major product of this collaboration has been a joint integrated library system, OLIS (Oxford Libraries Information System),[153] and its public interface, SOLO (Search Oxford Libraries Online), which provides an electronic catalogue covering all member libraries, as well as the libraries of individual colleges and other faculty libraries, which are not members of the group but do share cataloguing information.[154]\nA new book depository opened in South Marston, Swindon in October 2010,[155] and recent building projects include the remodelling of the New Bodleian building, which was renamed the Weston Library when it reopened in 2015.[156][157] The renovation is designed to better showcase the library's various treasures (which include a Shakespeare First Folio and a Gutenberg Bible) as well as temporary exhibitions.\nThe Bodleian engaged in a mass-digitisation project with Google in 2004.[158][159] Notable electronic resources hosted by the Bodleian Group include the Electronic Enlightenment Project, which was awarded the 2010 Digital Prize by the British Society for Eighteenth-Century Studies.[160]\nOxford maintains a number of museums and galleries, open for free to the public. The Ashmolean Museum, founded in 1683, is the oldest museum in the UK, and the oldest university museum in the world.[161] It holds significant collections of art and archaeology, including works by Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Turner, and Picasso, as well as treasures such as the Scorpion Macehead, the Parian Marble and the Alfred Jewel. It also contains \"The Messiah\", a pristine Stradivarius violin, regarded by some as one of the finest examples in existence.[162]\nThe University Museum of Natural History holds the university's zoological, entomological and geological specimens. It is housed in a large neo-Gothic building on Parks Road, in the university's Science Area.[163][164] Among its collection are the skeletons of a Tyrannosaurus rex and Triceratops, and the most complete remains of a dodo found anywhere in the world. It also hosts the Simonyi Professorship of the Public Understanding of Science, currently held by Marcus du Sautoy.{[165]\nAdjoining the Museum of Natural History is the Pitt Rivers Museum, founded in 1884, which displays the university's archaeological and anthropological collections, currently holding over 500,000 items. It recently built a new research annexe; its staff have been involved with the teaching of anthropology at Oxford since its foundation, when as part of his donation General Augustus Pitt Rivers stipulated that the university establish a lectureship in anthropology.[166]\nThe Museum of the History of Science is housed on Broad Street in the world's oldest-surviving purpose-built museum building.[167] It contains 15,000 artefacts, from antiquity to the 20th century, representing almost all aspects of the history of science. In the Faculty of Music on St Aldate's is the Bate Collection of Musical Instruments, a collection mostly of instruments from Western classical music, from the medieval period onwards. Christ Church Picture Gallery holds a large collection of old master paintings and drawings.[168]\nThe Oxford University Press is the world's second oldest and currently the largest university press by the number of publications.[169] More than 6,000 new books are published annually,[170] including many reference, professional, and academic works (such as the Oxford English Dictionary, the Concise Oxford English Dictionary, the Oxford World's Classics, the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, and the Concise Dictionary of National Biography).\nOxford is regularly ranked within the top five universities in the world and is currently ranked first in the world in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[177][178] as well as the Forbes's World University Rankings.[179] It held the number one position in the Times Good University Guide for eleven consecutive years,[180] and the medical school has also maintained first place in the \"Clinical, Pre-Clinical & Health\" table of the Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings for the past seven consecutive years.[181] In 2021, it ranked sixth among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[182] The THE has also recognised Oxford as one of the world's \"six super brands\" on its World Reputation Rankings, along with Berkeley, Cambridge, Harvard, MIT, and Stanford.[183] The university is fifth worldwide on the US News ranking.[184] Its Sa\u00efd Business School came 13th in the world in Financial Times Global MBA Ranking.[185]\nOxford was ranked 13th in the world in 2022 by the Nature Index, which measures the largest contributors to papers published in 82 leading journals.[186][187] It is ranked fifth best university worldwide and first in Britain for forming CEOs according to the Professional Ranking World Universities,[188] and first in the UK for the quality of its graduates as chosen by the recruiters of the UK's major companies.[189]\nIn the 2018 Complete University Guide, all 38 subjects offered by Oxford rank within the top 10 nationally meaning Oxford was one of only two multi-faculty universities (along with Cambridge) in the UK to have 100% of their subjects in the top 10.[190] Computer Science, Medicine, Philosophy, Politics and Psychology were ranked first in the UK by the guide.[191]\nAccording to the QS World University Rankings by Subject, the University of Oxford also ranks as number one in the world for four Humanities disciplines: English Language and Literature, Modern Languages, Geography, and History. It also ranks second globally for Anthropology, Archaeology, Law, Medicine, Politics & International Studies, and Psychology.[192]\nAcademic dress is required for examinations, matriculation, disciplinary hearings, and when visiting university officers. A referendum held among the Oxford student body in 2015 showed 76% against making it voluntary in examinations \u2013 8,671 students voted, with the 40.2% turnout the highest ever for a UK student union referendum.[193] This was widely interpreted by students as being a vote not so much on making subfusc voluntary, but rather, in effect, on abolishing it by default, in that if a minority of people came to exams without subfusc, the rest would soon follow.[194] In July 2012 the regulations regarding academic dress were modified to be more inclusive to transgender people.[195]\n'Trashing' is a tradition of spraying those who just finished their last examination of the year with alcohol, flour and confetti. The sprayed student stays in the academic dress worn to the exam. The custom began in the 1970s when friends of students taking their finals waited outside Oxford's Examination Schools where exams for most degrees are taken.[196]\nOther traditions and customs vary by college. For example, some colleges have formal hall six times a week, but in others this only happens occasionally, or even not at all. At most colleges these formal meals require gowns to be worn, and a Latin grace is said.[citation needed]\nBalls are major events held by colleges; the largest, held triennially in ninth week of Trinity Term, are called commemoration balls; the dress code is usually white tie. Many other colleges hold smaller events during the year that they call summer balls or parties. These are usually held on an annual or irregular basis, and are usually black tie. Punting is a common summer leisure activity.[citation needed]\nThere are several more or less quirky traditions peculiar to individual colleges, for example the All Souls Mallard song.[citation needed]\nSport is played between college teams, in tournaments known as cuppers (the term is also used for some non-sporting competitions). In addition to these there are higher standard university wide groups. Significant focus is given to annual varsity matches played against Cambridge, the most famous of which is The Boat Race, watched by a TV audience of between five and ten million viewers. This outside interest reflects the importance of rowing to many of those within the university. Much attention is given to the termly intercollegiate rowing regattas: Christ Church Regatta, Torpids, and Summer Eights. A blue is an award given to those who compete at the university team level in certain sports. As well as traditional sports, there are teams for activities such as Octopush and quidditch.[citation needed]\nThere are two weekly student newspapers: the independent Cherwell and OUSU's The Oxford Student. Other publications include the Isis magazine, the satirical Oxymoron, the graduate Oxonian Review, the Oxford Political Review,[197] and the online only newspaper The Oxford Blue. The student radio station is Oxide Radio. Most colleges have chapel choirs. Music, drama, and other arts societies exist both at the collegiate level and as university-wide groups, such as the Oxford University Dramatic Society and the Oxford Revue. Unlike most other collegiate societies, musical ensembles actively encourage players from other colleges.[citation needed]\nMost academic areas have student societies of some form which are open to students studying all courses, for example the Scientific Society. There are groups for almost all faiths, political parties, countries, and cultures.[citation needed]\nThe Oxford Union (not to be confused with the Oxford University Student Union) hosts weekly debates and high-profile speakers. There have historically been elite invitation-only societies such as the Bullingdon Club.[citation needed]\nThe Oxford University Student Union, formerly better known by its acronym OUSU and now rebranded as Oxford SU,[198] exists to represent students in the university's decision-making, to act as the voice for students in the national higher education policy debate, and to provide direct services to the student body. Reflecting the collegiate nature of the University of Oxford itself, OUSU is both an association of Oxford's more than 21,000 individual students and a federation of the affiliated college common rooms, and other affiliated organisations that represent subsets of the undergraduate and graduate students. The OUSU Executive Committee includes six full-time salaried sabbatical officers, who generally serve in the year following completion of their Final Examinations.[citation needed]\nThe importance of collegiate life is such that for many students their college JCR (Junior Common Room, for undergraduates) or MCR (Middle Common Room, for graduates) is seen as more important than OUSU. JCRs and MCRs each have a committee, with a president and other elected students representing their peers to college authorities. Additionally, they organise events and often have significant budgets to spend as they wish (money coming from their colleges and sometimes other sources such as student-run bars). (JCR and MCR are terms that are used to refer to rooms for use by members, as well as the student bodies.) Not all colleges use this JCR/MCR structure, for example Wadham College's entire student population is represented by a combined Students' Union and purely graduate colleges have different arrangements.[citation needed]\nThroughout its history, a sizeable number of Oxford alumni, known as Oxonians, have become notable in many varied fields, both academic and otherwise.

needed - Wikipedia": {"text": "To ensure that all Wikipedia content is verifiable, Wikipedia provides a means for anyone to question an uncited claim. If your work has been tagged, please provide a reliable source for the statement, and discuss if needed.\nYou can add a citation by selecting from the drop-down  menu at the top of the editing box. In markup, you can add a citation manually using ref tags. There are also more elaborate ways to cite sources.\nIn wiki markup, you can question an uncited claim by inserting a simple {{Citation needed}} tag, or a more comprehensive {{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=April 2023}}. Alternatively, {{fact}} and {{cn}} will produce the same result. These all display as:\nExample: 87 percent of statistics are made up on the spot.[citation needed]\nFor information on adding citations in articles, see Help:Referencing for beginners. For information on when to remove this template messages, see Help:Maintenance template removal.\nA \"citation needed\" tag is a request for another editor to supply a source for the tagged fact: a form of communication between members of a collaborative editing community. It is never, in itself, an \"improvement\" of an article. Though readers may be alerted by a \"citation needed\" that a particular statement is not supported, and even doubted by some, many readers don't fully understand the community's processes. Not all tags get addressed in a timely manner, staying in place for months or years, forming an ever-growing Wikipedia backlog\u2014this itself can be a problem. Best practice recommends the following:\nBefore adding a tag, at least consider the following alternatives, one of which may prove much more constructive:\nCurrently, there are 487,817 articles with \"Citation needed\" statements. You can browse the whole list of these articles at Category:All articles with unsourced statements.\nFrequently the authors of statements do not return to Wikipedia to support the statement with citations, so other Wikipedia editors have to do work checking those statements. With 487,817 statements that need WP:Verification, sometimes it's hard to choose which article to work on. The tool Citation Hunt makes that easier by suggesting random articles, which you can sort by topical category membership.", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed", "

Wikipedia": {"text": "Hartpury University and Hartpury College, formerly Hartpury College, is a provider of further and higher education which describes itself as specialising in the \"agriculture, animal, equine, sport and veterinary nursing\" sectors.[2] The university and college is set in a 360-hectare estate located in Hartpury, near Gloucester, in Gloucestershire, England.[3]\nThe college was established in the post-World War II era of the late 1940s, as an agricultural college with 50 students.[4] The college remained relatively unchanged until 1990, when a rapid expansion programme started with the provision of a larger variety of further education courses.\nHartpury's link with the University of the West of England (UWE) began in 1997 when Hartpury was awarded Associate Faculty status.[5] In 2017, Hartpury was granted \u2018Taught Degree Awarding Powers\u2019 (TDAP),[6] and in the same year was awarded the Teaching Excellence Framework Gold award.[7]\nHartpury College gained full university status in 2018 and changed its name to Hartpury University and Hartpury College.[8][9] Today, the institution offers undergraduate and postgraduate courses to higher education level students based in the UK and overseas.\nThe university has received awards for its teaching provision, ranking as the number one English mainstream university for teaching in the National Student Survey (NSS) 2022,[10] and in first place for lecturers and teaching quality at the Whatuni Student Choice Awards 2022.[11]\nIn the grounds of the college stands a Victorian bee shelter. The structure, known as a bee bole, is a Grade II* listed building.[12]\nThe institution has academies for sports including rugby, football, modern pentathlon, equine, rowing, netball and golf.\nHartpury University and Hartpury College is known for its development of rugby players, with many former students playing at the highest level.[13] It hosts Hartpury University R.F.C, which has an association with the professional club Gloucester Rugby, and Gloucester-Hartpury Women RFC, in partnership with the same club.[14]\nIn 2010 Gloucester Rowing Club and Hartpury College set up a centre to enable Hartpury students to participate in one of the Great Britain's rowing team centres. Students are members of the Gloucester Rowing Club and can use its rowing facilities. In return the senior rowers from the club can use the training facilities at the college. The relationship has brought significant success at national and international level.[15]\nThe college has an alumni association, with membership extending to former students from both Further and Higher Education programmes, as well as current and former members of staff.[16]\nIn June 2017 the college expelled one student and suspended several others following a police investigation into images circulated online and on social media depicting students from Hartpury College apparently killing a fox cub and posing with a dead cat.[17][18][19] The College and Gloucestershire police both issued statements concluding they were satisfied the killing of the fox was not an act of cruelty, and that one of the students, who was training as a gamekeeper, had killed the animal to end its suffering after it had been hit by road traffic. The police declined to take further action.[20][21]\nCoordinates: 51\u00b054\u203225\u2033N 2\u00b013\u203248\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff51.907\u00b0N 2.230\u00b0W\ufeff / 51.907; -2.230", "links":

Wikipedia": {"text": "Discrete geometry and combinatorial geometry are branches of geometry that study combinatorial properties and constructive methods of discrete geometric objects.  Most questions in discrete geometry involve finite or discrete sets of basic geometric objects, such as points, lines, planes, circles, spheres, polygons, and so forth.  The subject focuses on the combinatorial properties of these objects, such as how they intersect one another, or how they may be arranged to cover a larger object.\nDiscrete geometry has a large overlap with convex geometry and computational geometry, and is closely related to subjects such as finite geometry, combinatorial optimization, digital geometry, discrete differential geometry, geometric graph theory, toric geometry, and combinatorial topology.\nAlthough polyhedra and tessellations had been studied for many years by people such as Kepler and Cauchy, modern discrete geometry has its origins in the late 19th century.  Early topics studied were: the density of circle packings by Thue, projective configurations by Reye and Steinitz, the geometry of numbers by Minkowski, and map colourings by Tait, Heawood, and Hadwiger.\nL\u00e1szl\u00f3 Fejes T\u00f3th, H.S.M. Coxeter, and Paul Erd\u0151s laid the foundations of discrete geometry.[1][2][3]\nA polytope is a geometric object with flat sides, which exists in any general number of dimensions. A polygon is a polytope in two dimensions, a polyhedron in three dimensions, and so on in higher dimensions (such as a 4-polytope in four dimensions). Some theories further generalize the idea to include such objects as unbounded polytopes (apeirotopes and tessellations), and abstract polytopes.\nThe following are some of the aspects of polytopes studied in discrete geometry:\nPackings, coverings, and tilings are all ways of arranging uniform objects (typically circles, spheres, or tiles) in a regular way on a surface or manifold.\nA sphere packing is an arrangement of non-overlapping spheres within a containing space. The spheres considered are usually all of identical size, and the space is usually three-dimensional Euclidean space. However, sphere packing problems can be generalised to consider unequal spheres, n-dimensional Euclidean space (where the problem becomes circle packing in two dimensions, or hypersphere packing in higher dimensions) or to non-Euclidean spaces such as hyperbolic space.\nA tessellation of a flat surface is the tiling of a plane using one or more geometric shapes, called tiles, with no overlaps and no gaps. In mathematics, tessellations can be generalized to higher dimensions.\nSpecific topics in this area include:\nStructural rigidity is a combinatorial theory for predicting the flexibility of ensembles formed by rigid bodies connected by flexible linkages or hinges.\nTopics in this area include:\nIncidence structures generalize planes (such as affine, projective, and M\u00f6bius planes) as can be seen from their axiomatic definitions. Incidence structures also generalize the higher-dimensional analogs and the finite structures are sometimes called finite geometries.\nFormally, an incidence structure is a triple\nwhere P is a set of \"points\", L is a set of \"lines\" and \n\n\n\nI\n\u2286\nP\n\u00d7\nL\n\n\n{\\displaystyle I\\subseteq P\\times L}\n\n is the incidence relation. The elements of \n\n\n\nI\n\n\n{\\displaystyle I}\n\n are called flags. If\nwe say that point p \"lies on\" line \n\n\n\nl\n\n\n{\\displaystyle l}\n\n.\nTopics in this area include:\nAn oriented matroid is a mathematical structure that abstracts the properties of directed graphs and of arrangements of vectors in a vector space over an ordered field (particularly for partially ordered vector spaces).[4] In comparison, an ordinary (i.e., non-oriented) matroid abstracts the dependence properties that are common both to graphs, which are not necessarily directed, and to arrangements of vectors over fields, which are not necessarily ordered.[5][6]\nA geometric graph is a graph in which the vertices or edges are associated with geometric objects. Examples include Euclidean graphs, the 1-skeleton of a polyhedron or polytope, unit disk graphs, and visibility graphs.\nTopics in this area include:\nA simplicial complex is a topological space of a certain kind, constructed by \"gluing together\" points, line segments, triangles, and their n-dimensional counterparts (see illustration).  Simplicial complexes should not be confused with the more abstract notion of a simplicial set appearing in modern simplicial homotopy theory.  The purely combinatorial counterpart to a simplicial complex is an abstract simplicial complex. See also random geometric complexes.\nThe discipline of combinatorial topology used combinatorial concepts in topology and in the early 20th century this turned into the field of algebraic topology.\nIn 1978, the situation was reversed \u2013 methods from algebraic topology were used to solve a problem in combinatorics \u2013 when L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Lov\u00e1sz proved the Kneser conjecture, thus beginning the new study of topological combinatorics. Lov\u00e1sz's proof used the Borsuk-Ulam theorem and this theorem retains a prominent role in this new field. This theorem has many equivalent versions and analogs and has been used in the study of fair division problems.\nTopics in this area include:\nA discrete group is a group G equipped with the discrete topology. With this topology, G becomes a topological group. A discrete subgroup of a topological group G is a subgroup H whose relative topology is the discrete one. For example, the integers, Z, form a discrete subgroup of the reals, R (with the standard metric topology), but the rational numbers, Q, do not.\nA lattice in a locally compact topological group is a discrete subgroup with the property that the quotient space has finite invariant measure. In the special case of subgroups of Rn, this amounts to the usual geometric notion of a lattice, and both the algebraic structure of lattices and the geometry of the totality of all lattices are relatively well understood. Deep results of Borel, Harish-Chandra, Mostow, Tamagawa, M. S. Raghunathan, Margulis, Zimmer obtained from the 1950s through the 1970s provided examples and generalized much of the theory to the setting of nilpotent Lie groups and semisimple algebraic groups over a local field. In the 1990s, Bass and Lubotzky initiated the study of tree lattices, which remains an active research area.\nTopics in this area include:\nDigital geometry deals with discrete sets (usually discrete point sets) considered to be digitized models or images of objects of the 2D or 3D Euclidean space.\nSimply put, digitizing is replacing an object by a discrete set of its points. The images we see on the TV screen, the raster display of a computer, or in newspapers are in fact digital images.\nIts main application areas are computer graphics and image analysis.[7]\nDiscrete differential geometry is the study of discrete counterparts of notions in differential geometry. Instead of smooth curves and surfaces, there are polygons, meshes, and simplicial complexes. It is used in the study of computer graphics and topological combinatorics.\nTopics in this area include:", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_geometry", "
