{"China - Wikipedia": {"text": "China (Chinese: \u4e2d\u56fd; pinyin: Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3), officially the People's Republic of China (PRC),[k] is a country in East Asia. It has been the world's most populous country since at least 1950, with a population exceeding 1.4 billion, but is expected to be overtaken by India in mid-2023. China spans the equivalent of five time zones and borders fourteen countries by land,[l] the most of any country in the world tied with Russia. With an area of approximately 9.6\u00a0million square kilometres (3,700,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), it is the world's third largest country by total land area.[m] The country consists of 22 provinces,[n] five autonomous regions, four municipalities, and two special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau). The national capital is Beijing, and the most populous city and largest financial center is Shanghai.\nModern Chinese trace their origins to a cradle of civilization in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain. The semi-legendary Xia dynasty in the 21st century BCE and the Shang and Zhou dynasties developed a bureaucratic political system to serve hereditary monarchies, or dynasties. Written script, classic literature, and the Hundred Schools of Thought emerged during this period and influenced the region and beyond for centuries to come. In the third century BCE, Qin Shi Huang founded the first Chinese empire, the Qin dynasty. Short-lived, the Qin was followed by the more stable Han dynasty (206 BCE\u2013220 CE). Together they laid the foundation for a political tradition of nearly two millennia in which the Chinese empire was one of the world's foremost economic powers. The empire expanded, fractured, and reunified; was conquered and reestablished; absorbed foreign religions and ideas; and made world-leading scientific advances, such as the Four Great Inventions: gunpowder, paper, the compass, and printing. After centuries of disunity following the fall of the Han, the Sui (581\u2013618) and Tang (618\u2013907) dynasties reunified the empire. The multi-ethnic Tang welcomed foreign trade and culture that came over the Silk Road and adapted Buddhism to Chinese needs. The early modern Song dynasty (960\u20131279) became increasingly urban and commercial. The civilian scholar-officials or literati adopted the examination system and the doctrines of Neo-Confucianism to replace the military aristocrats of earlier dynasties. The Mongol established the Yuan dynasty in 1279 before the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644) re-established Han Chinese control. The Manchu-led Qing dynasty nearly doubled the empire's territory and established a multi-ethnic state that was the basis of the modern Chinese nation, although subsequently suffered heavy losses to foreign imperialism in the 19th century.\nThe Chinese monarchy collapsed in 1912 with the Xinhai Revolution, when the Republic of China (ROC) replaced the imperial ruling of Qing. In its early years as a republic, the country underwent a period of instability known as the Warlord Era before mostly reunifying in 1928 under a Nationalist government. A civil war between the nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) began in 1927. Japan invaded China in 1937, starting the Second Sino-Japanese War, halting the civil war. The surrender and expulsion of Japanese forces in 1945 left a power vacuum in the country, which led to renewed fighting between the CCP and the KMT. The civil war is considered to have ended in with a division in 1949[o] when the CCP established the People's Republic of China on the mainland while the Kuomintang-led ROC government retreated to the islands of Taiwan.[p] With them both claiming to be the sole legitimate government of China, the United Nations has recognized the PRC as the sole representation since 1971. From 1959 to 1961, the PRC implemented an economic and social campaign called the \"Great Leap Forward\" that resulted in a sharp economic decline and an estimated 15 to 55 million deaths, mostly through human-made famine. From 1966 to 1976, the turbulent period of political and social chaos within China known as the Cultural Revolution led to greater economic and educational decline, with millions being purged or subjected to either persecution or \"politicide\" based on political categories. Since then, the Chinese government has rebuked some of the earlier Maoist policies, conducting a series of political and economic reforms since 1978 that have greatly raised Chinese standards of living, and increased life expectancies.\nChina is currently governed as a unitary Marxist\u2013Leninist one-party socialist state by the CCP. China ranks poorly in measures of democracy, transparency, press freedom, religious freedom, and ethnic equality. The Chinese authorities have been criticized by human rights activists and non-governmental organizations for human rights abuses, including mass censorship, mass surveillance, and suppression of  dissent. China is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and a founding member of several multilateral and regional cooperation organizations such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the Silk Road Fund, the New Development Bank, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and the RCEP. It is also a member of the BRICS, the G8+5, the G20, the APEC, and the East Asia Summit. Making up around one-fifth of the world economy, China is the world's largest economy by GDP at purchasing power parity, the second-largest economy by nominal GDP, and the second-wealthiest country. The country is one of the fastest-growing major economies and is the world's largest manufacturer and exporter, as well as the second-largest importer. China is a recognized nuclear-weapon state with the world's largest standing army by military personnel and the second-largest defense budget.\nThe word \"China\" has been used in English since the 16th century; however, it was not a word used by the Chinese themselves during this period. Its origin has been traced through Portuguese, Malay, and Persian back to the Sanskrit word C\u012bna, used in ancient India.[19] \"China\" appears in Richard Eden's 1555 translation[q] of the 1516 journal of the Portuguese explorer Duarte Barbosa.[r][19] Barbosa's usage was derived from Persian Ch\u012bn (\u0686\u06cc\u0646), which was in turn derived from Sanskrit C\u012bna (\u091a\u0940\u0928).[24] C\u012bna was first used in early Hindu scripture, including the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata (5th century\u00a0BCE) and the Laws of Manu (2nd century\u00a0BCE).[25] In 1655, Martino Martini suggested that the word China is derived ultimately from the name of the Qin dynasty (221\u2013206 BCE).[26][25] Although usage in Indian sources precedes this dynasty, this derivation is still given in various sources.[27] The origin of the Sanskrit word is a matter of debate, according to the Oxford English Dictionary.[19]\nAlternative suggestions include the names for Yelang and the Jing or Chu state.[25][28]\nThe official name of the modern state is the \"People's Republic of China\" (simplified Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd; traditional Chinese: \u4e2d\u83ef\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u570b; pinyin: Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3). The shorter form is \"China\" Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 (\u4e2d\u56fd; \u4e2d\u570b) from zh\u014dng (\"central\") and gu\u00f3 (\"state\"),[s] a term which developed under the Western Zhou dynasty in reference to its royal demesne.[t][u] It was then applied to the area around Luoyi (present-day Luoyang) during the Eastern Zhou and then to China's Central Plain before being used as an occasional synonym for the state under the Qing.[30] It was often used as a cultural concept to distinguish the Huaxia people from perceived \"barbarians\".[30] The name Zhongguo is also translated as \"Middle Kingdom\" in English.[33] China (PRC) is sometimes referred to as the Mainland when distinguishing the ROC from the PRC.[34][35][36][37]\nChina is regarded as one of the world's oldest civilisations.[38][39] Archaeological evidence suggests that early hominids inhabited the country 2.25 million years ago.[40] The hominid fossils of Peking Man, a Homo erectus who used fire,[41] were discovered in a cave at Zhoukoudian near Beijing; they have been dated to between 680,000 and 780,000 years ago.[42] The fossilized teeth of Homo sapiens (dated to 125,000\u201380,000 years ago) have been discovered in Fuyan Cave in Dao County, Hunan.[43] Chinese proto-writing existed in Jiahu around 6600 BCE,[44] at Damaidi around 6000 BCE,[45] Dadiwan from 5800 to 5400 BCE, and Banpo dating from the 5th millennium BCE. Some scholars have suggested that the Jiahu symbols (7th millennium BCE) constituted the earliest Chinese writing system.[44]\nAccording to Chinese tradition, the first dynasty was the Xia, which emerged around 2100 BCE.[46] The Xia dynasty marked the beginning of China's political system based on hereditary monarchies, or dynasties, which lasted for a millennium.[47] The Xia dynasty was considered mythical by historians until scientific excavations found early Bronze Age sites at Erlitou, Henan in 1959.[48] It remains unclear whether these sites are the remains of the Xia dynasty or of another culture from the same period.[49] The succeeding Shang dynasty is the earliest to be confirmed by contemporary records.[50] The Shang ruled the plain of the Yellow River in eastern China from the 17th to the 11th century\u00a0BCE.[51] Their oracle bone script (from c.\u20091500 BCE)[52][53] represents the oldest form of Chinese writing yet found[54] and is a direct ancestor of modern Chinese characters.[55]\nThe Shang was conquered by the Zhou, who ruled between the 11th and 5th centuries\u00a0BCE, though centralized authority was slowly eroded by feudal warlords. Some principalities eventually emerged from the weakened Zhou, no longer fully obeyed the Zhou king, and continually waged war with each other during the 300-year Spring and Autumn period. By the time of the Warring States period of the 5th\u20133rd centuries\u00a0BCE, there were only seven powerful states left.[56]\nThe Warring States period ended in 221\u00a0BCE after the state of Qin conquered the other six kingdoms, reunited China and established the dominant order of autocracy. King Zheng of Qin proclaimed himself the First Emperor of the Qin dynasty. He enacted Qin's legalist reforms throughout China, notably the forced standardization of Chinese characters, measurements, road widths (i.e., the cart axles' length), and currency. His dynasty also conquered the Yue tribes in Guangxi, Guangdong, and Vietnam.[57] The Qin dynasty lasted only fifteen years, falling soon after the First Emperor's death, as his harsh authoritarian policies led to widespread rebellion.[58][59]\nFollowing a widespread civil war during which the imperial library at Xianyang was burned,[v] the Han dynasty emerged to rule China between 206\u00a0BCE and CE\u00a0220, creating a cultural identity among its populace still remembered in the ethnonym of the Han Chinese.[58][59] The Han expanded the empire's territory considerably, with military campaigns reaching Central Asia, Mongolia, South Korea, and Yunnan, and the recovery of Guangdong and northern Vietnam from Nanyue. Han involvement in Central Asia and Sogdia helped establish the land route of the Silk Road, replacing the earlier path over the Himalayas to India. Han China gradually became the largest economy of the ancient world.[61] Despite the Han's initial decentralization and the official abandonment of the Qin philosophy of Legalism in favor of Confucianism, Qin's legalist institutions and policies continued to be employed by the Han government and its successors.[62]\nAfter the end of the Han dynasty, a period of strife known as Three Kingdoms followed,[63] whose central figures were later immortalized in one of the Four Classics of Chinese literature. At its end, Wei was swiftly overthrown by the Jin dynasty. The Jin fell to civil war upon the ascension of a developmentally disabled emperor; the Five Barbarians then invaded and ruled northern China as the Sixteen States. The Xianbei unified them as the Northern Wei, whose Emperor Xiaowen reversed his predecessors' apartheid policies and enforced a drastic sinification on his subjects, largely integrating them into Chinese culture. In the south, the general Liu Yu secured the abdication of the Jin in favor of the Liu Song. The various successors of these states became known as the Northern and Southern dynasties, with the two areas finally reunited by the Sui in 581. The Sui restored the Han to power through China, reformed its agriculture, economy and imperial examination system, constructed the Grand Canal, and patronized Buddhism. However, they fell quickly when their conscription for public works and a failed war in northern Korea provoked widespread unrest.[64][65]\nUnder the succeeding Tang and Song dynasties, Chinese economy, technology, and culture entered a golden age.[66] The Tang dynasty retained control of the Western Regions and the Silk Road,[67] which brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa,[68] and made the capital Chang'an a cosmopolitan urban center. However, it was devastated and weakened by the An Lushan Rebellion in the 8th century.[69] In 907, the Tang disintegrated completely when the local military governors became ungovernable. The Song dynasty ended the separatist situation in 960, leading to a balance of power between the Song and Khitan Liao. The Song was the first government in world history to issue paper money and the first Chinese polity to establish a permanent standing navy which was supported by the developed shipbuilding industry along with the sea trade.[70]\nBetween the 10th and 11th centuries, the population of China doubled in size to around 100 million people, mostly because of the expansion of rice cultivation in central and southern China, and the production of abundant food surpluses. The Song dynasty also saw a revival of Confucianism, in response to the growth of Buddhism during the Tang,[71] and a flourishing of philosophy and the arts, as landscape art and porcelain were brought to new levels of maturity and complexity.[72][73] However, the military weakness of the Song army was observed by the Jurchen Jin dynasty. In 1127, Emperor Huizong of Song and the capital Bianjing were captured during the Jin\u2013Song Wars. The remnants of the Song retreated to southern China.[74]\nThe Mongol conquest of China began in 1205 with the gradual conquest of Western Xia by Genghis Khan,[75] who also invaded Jin territories.[76] In 1271, the Mongol leader Kublai Khan established the Yuan dynasty, which conquered the last remnant of the Song dynasty in 1279. Before the Mongol invasion, the population of Song China was 120 million citizens; this was reduced to 60 million by the time of the census in 1300.[77] A peasant named Zhu Yuanzhang led a rebellion that overthrew the Yuan in 1368 and founded the Ming dynasty as the Hongwu Emperor. Under the Ming dynasty, China enjoyed another golden age, developing one of the strongest navies in the world and a rich and prosperous economy amid a flourishing of art and culture. It was during this period that admiral Zheng He led the Ming treasure voyages throughout the Indian Ocean, reaching as far as East Africa.[78]\nIn the early years of the Ming dynasty, China's capital was moved from Nanjing to Beijing. With the budding of capitalism, philosophers such as Wang Yangming further critiqued and expanded Neo-Confucianism with concepts of individualism and equality of four occupations.[79] The scholar-official stratum became a supporting force of industry and commerce in the tax boycott movements, which, together with the famines and defense against Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u20131598) and Manchu invasions led to an exhausted treasury.[80] In 1644, Beijing was captured by a coalition of peasant rebel forces led by Li Zicheng. The Chongzhen Emperor committed suicide when the city fell. The Manchu Qing dynasty, then allied with Ming dynasty general Wu Sangui, overthrew Li's short-lived Shun dynasty and subsequently seized control of Beijing, which became the new capital of the Qing dynasty.[81]\nThe Qing dynasty, which lasted from 1644 until 1912, was the last imperial dynasty of China. Its conquest of the Ming (1618\u20131683) cost 25 million lives and the economy of China shrank drastically.[82] After the Southern Ming ended, the further conquest of the Dzungar Khanate added Mongolia, Tibet and Xinjiang to the empire.[83] The centralized autocracy was strengthened to suppress anti-Qing sentiment with the policy of valuing agriculture and restraining commerce, the Haijin (\"sea ban\"), and ideological control as represented by the literary inquisition, causing social and technological stagnation.[84][85]\nIn the mid-19th century, the Qing dynasty experienced Western imperialism in the Opium Wars with Britain and France. China was forced to pay compensation, open treaty ports, allow extraterritoriality for foreign nationals, and cede Hong Kong to the British[86] under the 1842 Treaty of Nanking, the first of the Unequal Treaties. The First Sino-Japanese War (1894\u20131895) resulted in Qing China's loss of influence in the Korean Peninsula, as well as the cession of Taiwan to Japan.[87]\nThe Qing dynasty also began experiencing internal unrest in which tens of millions of people died, especially in the White Lotus Rebellion, the failed Taiping Rebellion that ravaged southern China in the 1850s and 1860s and the Dungan Revolt (1862\u20131877) in the northwest. The initial success of the Self-Strengthening Movement of the 1860s was frustrated by a series of military defeats in the 1880s and 1890s.[citation needed]\nIn the 19th century, the great Chinese diaspora began. Losses due to emigration were added to by conflicts and catastrophes such as the Northern Chinese Famine of 1876\u20131879, in which between 9 and 13 million people died.[88] The Guangxu Emperor drafted a reform plan in 1898 to establish a modern constitutional monarchy, but these plans were thwarted by the Empress Dowager Cixi. The ill-fated anti-foreign Boxer Rebellion of 1899\u20131901 further weakened the dynasty. Although Cixi sponsored a program of reforms, the Xinhai Revolution of 1911\u20131912 brought an end to the Qing dynasty and established the Republic of China.[89] Puyi, the last Emperor of China, abdicated in 1912.[90]\nOn 1 January 1912, the Republic of China was established, and Sun Yat-sen of the Kuomintang (the KMT or Nationalist Party) was proclaimed provisional president.[91] On 12 February 1912, regent Empress Dowager Longyu sealed the imperial abdication decree on behalf of 4 year old Puyi, the last emperor of China, ending 5,000 years of monarchy in China.[92] In March 1912, the presidency was given to Yuan Shikai, a former Qing general who in 1915 proclaimed himself Emperor of China. In the face of popular condemnation and opposition from his own Beiyang Army, he was forced to abdicate and re-establish the republic in 1916.[93]\nAfter Yuan Shikai's death in 1916, China was politically fragmented. Its Beijing-based government was internationally recognized but virtually powerless; regional warlords controlled most of its territory.[94][95] In the late 1920s, the Kuomintang under Chiang Kai-shek, the then Principal of the Republic of China Military Academy, was able to reunify the country under its own control with a series of deft military and political maneuverings, known collectively as the Northern Expedition.[96][97] The Kuomintang moved the nation's capital to Nanjing and implemented \"political tutelage\", an intermediate stage of political development outlined in Sun Yat-sen's San-min program for transforming China into a modern democratic state.[98][99] The political division in China made it difficult for Chiang to battle the communist-led People's Liberation Army (PLA), against whom the Kuomintang had been warring since 1927 in the Chinese Civil War. This war continued successfully for the Kuomintang, especially after the PLA retreated in the Long March, until Japanese aggression and the 1936 Xi'an Incident forced Chiang to confront Imperial Japan.[100]\nThe Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945), a theater of World War II, forced an uneasy alliance between the Kuomintang and the Communists. Japanese forces committed numerous war atrocities against the civilian population; in all, as many as 20 million Chinese civilians died.[101] An estimated 40,000 to 300,000 Chinese were massacred in the city of Nanjing alone during the Japanese occupation.[102] During the war, China, along with the UK, the United States, and the Soviet Union, were referred to as \"trusteeship of the powerful\"[103] and were recognized as the Allied \"Big Four\" in the Declaration by United Nations.[104][105] Along with the other three great powers, China was one of the four major Allies of World War II, and was later considered one of the primary victors in the war.[106][107] After the surrender of Japan in 1945, Taiwan, including the Pescadores, was handed over to Chinese control. However, the validity of this handover is controversial, in that whether Taiwan's sovereignty was legally transferred and whether China is a legitimate recipient, due to complex issues that arose from the handling of Japan's surrender, resulting in the unresolved political status of Taiwan, which is a flashpoint of potential war between China and Taiwan. China emerged victorious but war-ravaged and financially drained. The continued distrust between the Kuomintang and the Communists led to the resumption of civil war. Constitutional rule was established in 1947, but because of the ongoing unrest, many provisions of the ROC constitution were never implemented in mainland China.[108]\nBefore the existence of the People's Republic, the CCP had declared several areas of the country as the Chinese Soviet Republic (Jiangxi Soviet), a predecessor state to the PRC, in November 1931 in Ruijin, Jiangxi. The Jiangxi Soviet was wiped out by the KMT armies in 1934 and was relocated to Yan'an in Shaanxi where the Long March concluded in 1935.[109][failed verification] It would be the base of the communists before major combat in the Chinese Civil War ended in 1949. Afterwards, the CCP took control of most of mainland China, and the Kuomintang retreating offshore to Taiwan, reducing its territory to only Taiwan, Hainan, and their surrounding islands.\nOn 1 October 1949, CCP Chairman Mao Zedong formally proclaimed the establishment of the People's Republic of China at the new nation's founding ceremony and inaugural military parade in Tiananmen Square, Beijing.[111][112] In 1950, the People's Liberation Army captured Hainan from the ROC[113] and annexed Tibet.[114] However, remaining Kuomintang forces continued to wage an insurgency in western China throughout the 1950s.[115]\nThe government consolidated its popularity among the peasants through land reform, which included the execution of between 1 and 2 million landlords.[116] China developed an independent industrial system and its own nuclear weapons.[117] The Chinese population increased from 550 million in 1950 to 900 million in 1974.[118] However, the Great Leap Forward, an idealistic massive reform project, resulted in an estimated 15 to 55 million deaths between 1959 and 1961, mostly from starvation.[119][120] In 1964, China's first atomic bomb exploded successfully.[121] In 1966, Mao and his allies launched the Cultural Revolution, sparking a decade of political recrimination and social upheaval that lasted until Mao's death in 1976. In October 1971, the PRC replaced the Republic of China in the United Nations, and took its seat as a permanent member of the Security Council.[122] This UN action also created the problem of the political status of Taiwan and the Two Chinas issue.\nAfter Mao's death, the Gang of Four was quickly arrested by Hua Guofeng and held responsible for the excesses of the Cultural Revolution. Deng Xiaoping took power in 1978, and instituted significant economic reforms. The CCP loosened governmental control over citizens' personal lives, and the communes were gradually disbanded in favor of working contracted to households. Agricultural collectivization was dismantled and farmlands privatized, while foreign trade became a major new focus, leading to the creation of Special Economic Zones (SEZs). Inefficient state-owned enterprises (SOEs) were restructured and unprofitable ones were closed outright, resulting in massive job losses.[citation needed] This marked China's transition from a planned economy to a mixed economy with an increasingly open-market environment.[123] China adopted its current constitution on 4 December 1982. In 1989, the suppression of student protests in Tiananmen Square brought condemnations and sanctions against the Chinese government from various foreign countries.[124]\nJiang Zemin, Li Peng and Zhu Rongji led the nation in the 1990s. Under their administration, China's economic performance pulled an estimated[by whom?] 150 million peasants out of poverty and sustained an average annual gross domestic product growth rate of 11.2%.[125][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] British Hong Kong and Portuguese Macau returned to China in 1997 and 1999, respectively, as the Hong Kong and Macau special administrative regions under the principle of One country, two systems. The country joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, and maintained its high rate of economic growth under Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao's leadership in the 2000s. However, the growth also severely impacted the country's resources and environment,[126][127] and caused major social displacement.[128][129]\nCCP general secretary Xi Jinping has ruled since 2012 and has pursued large-scale efforts to reform China's economy,[130][131] which has suffered from structural instabilities and slowing growth,[132][133][134] and has also reformed the one-child policy and penal system,[135] as well as instituting a vast anti-corruption crackdown.[136] In the early 2010s, China's economic growth rate began to slow amid domestic credit troubles, weakening international demand for Chinese exports and fragility in the global economy.[137][138][139] In 2013, China initiated the Belt and Road Initiative, a global infrastructure investment project.[140] Since 2017, the Chinese government has been engaged in a harsh crackdown in Xinjiang, with an estimated one million people, mostly Uyghurs but including other ethnic and religious minorities, in internment camps.[141] The National People's Congress in 2018 altered the country's constitution to remove the two-term limit on holding the Presidency of China, permitting the current leader, Xi Jinping, to remain president of China (and general secretary of the CCP) for an unlimited time, earning criticism for creating dictatorial governance.[142][143] In 2020, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) passed a national security law in Hong Kong that gave the Hong Kong government wide-ranging tools to crack down on dissent.[144] In December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic began with an outbreak in Wuhan; after three years of strict public health measures indented to completely eradicate the virus, mounting social and economic pressures compelled the government to loosen restrictions in December 2022.\nChina's landscape is vast and diverse, ranging from the Gobi and Taklamakan Deserts in the arid north to the subtropical forests in the wetter south. The Himalaya, Karakoram, Pamir and Tian Shan mountain ranges separate China from much of South and Central Asia. The Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, the third- and sixth-longest in the world, respectively, run from the Tibetan Plateau to the densely populated eastern seaboard. China's coastline along the Pacific Ocean is 14,500\u00a0km (9,000\u00a0mi) long and is bounded by the Bohai, Yellow, East China and South China seas. China connects through the Kazakh border to the Eurasian Steppe which has been an artery of communication between East and West since the Neolithic through the Steppe Route \u2013 the ancestor of the terrestrial Silk Road(s).[citation needed]\nThe territory of China lies between latitudes 18\u00b0 and 54\u00b0 N, and longitudes 73\u00b0 and 135\u00b0 E. The geographical center of China is marked by the Center of the Country Monument at 35\u00b050\u203240.9\u2033N 103\u00b027\u20327.5\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff35.844694\u00b0N 103.452083\u00b0E\ufeff / 35.844694; 103.452083\ufeff (Geographical center of China). China's landscapes vary significantly across its vast territory. In the east, along the shores of the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea, there are extensive and densely populated alluvial plains, while on the edges of the Inner Mongolian plateau in the north, broad grasslands predominate. Southern China is dominated by hills and low mountain ranges, while the central-east hosts the deltas of China's two major rivers, the Yellow River and the Yangtze River. Other major rivers include the Xi, Mekong, Brahmaputra and Amur. To the west sit major mountain ranges, most notably the Himalayas. High plateaus feature among the more arid landscapes of the north, such as the Taklamakan and the Gobi Desert. The world's highest point, Mount Everest (8,848\u00a0m), lies on the Sino-Nepalese border.[145] The country's lowest point, and the world's third-lowest, is the dried lake bed of Ayding Lake (\u2212154\u00a0m) in the Turpan Depression.[146]\nChina's climate is mainly dominated by dry seasons and wet monsoons, which lead to pronounced temperature differences between winter and summer. In the winter, northern winds coming from high-latitude areas are cold and dry; in summer, southern winds from coastal areas at lower latitudes are warm and moist.[148]\nA major environmental issue in China is the continued expansion of its deserts, particularly the Gobi Desert.[149][150] Although barrier tree lines planted since the 1970s have reduced the frequency of sandstorms, prolonged drought and poor agricultural practices have resulted in dust storms plaguing northern China each spring, which then spread to other parts of East Asia, including Japan and Korea. China's environmental watchdog, SEPA, stated in 2007 that China is losing 4,000\u00a0km2 (1,500\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) per year to desertification.[151] Water quality, erosion, and pollution control have become important issues in China's relations with other countries. Melting glaciers in the Himalayas could potentially lead to water shortages for hundreds of millions of people.[152] According to academics, in order to limit climate change in China to 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C (2.7\u00a0\u00b0F) electricity generation from coal in China without carbon capture must be phased out by 2045.[153] Official government statistics about Chinese agricultural productivity are considered unreliable, due to exaggeration of production at subsidiary government levels.[154][155] Much of China has a climate very suitable for agriculture and the country has been the world's largest producer of rice, wheat, tomatoes, eggplant, grapes, watermelon, spinach, and many other crops.[156]\nChina is one of 17 megadiverse countries,[157] lying in two of the world's major biogeographic realms: the Palearctic and the Indomalayan. By one measure, China has over 34,687 species of animals and vascular plants, making it the third-most biodiverse country in the world, after Brazil and Colombia.[158] The country signed the Rio de Janeiro Convention on Biological Diversity on 11 June 1992, and became a party to the convention on 5 January 1993.[159] It later produced a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, with one revision that was received by the convention on 21 September 2010.[160]\nChina is home to at least 551 species of mammals (the third-highest such number in the world),[161] 1,221 species of birds (eighth),[162] 424 species of reptiles (seventh)[163] and 333 species of amphibians (seventh).[164] Wildlife in China shares habitat with, and bears acute pressure from, the world's largest population of humans. At least 840 animal species are threatened, vulnerable or in danger of local extinction in China, due mainly to human activity such as habitat destruction, pollution and poaching for food, fur and ingredients for traditional Chinese medicine.[165] Endangered wildlife is protected by law, and as of 2005[update], the country has over 2,349 nature reserves, covering a total area of 149.95 million hectares, 15 percent of China's total land area.[166][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] Most wild animals have been eliminated from the core agricultural regions of east and central China, but they have fared better in the mountainous south and west.[167][168] The Baiji was confirmed extinct on 12 December 2006.[169]\nChina has over 32,000 species of vascular plants,[170] and is home to a variety of forest types. Cold coniferous forests predominate in the north of the country, supporting animal species such as moose and Asian black bear, along with over 120 bird species.[171] The understory of moist conifer forests may contain thickets of bamboo. In higher montane stands of juniper and yew, the bamboo is replaced by rhododendrons. Subtropical forests, which are predominate in central and southern China, support a high density of plant species including numerous rare endemics. Tropical and seasonal rainforests, though confined to Yunnan and Hainan Island, contain a quarter of all the animal and plant species found in China.[171] China has over 10,000 recorded species of fungi,[172] and of them, nearly 6,000 are higher fungi.\nIn the early 2000s, China has suffered from environmental deterioration and pollution due to its rapid pace of industrialization.[173][174] While regulations such as the 1979 Environmental Protection Law are fairly stringent, they are poorly enforced, as they are frequently disregarded by local communities and government officials in favor of rapid economic development.[175] China is the country with the second highest death toll because of air pollution, after India. There are approximately 1 million deaths caused by exposure to ambient air pollution.[176][177] Although China ranks as the highest CO2 emitting country in the world,[178] it only emits 8 tons of CO2 per capita, significantly lower than developed countries such as the United States (16.1), Australia (16.8) and South Korea (13.6).[179]\nIn recent years, China has clamped down on pollution. In March 2014, CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping \"declared war\" on pollution during the opening of the National People's Congress.[180] After extensive debate lasting nearly two years, the parliament approved a new environmental law in April. The new law empowers environmental enforcement agencies with great punitive power and large fines for offenders, defines areas which require extra protection, and gives independent environmental groups more ability to operate in the country.[citation needed] In 2020, Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping announced that China aims to peak emissions before 2030 and go carbon-neutral by 2060 in accordance with the Paris climate accord.[181] According to Climate Action Tracker, if accomplished it would lower the expected rise in global temperature by 0.2 \u2013 0.3 degrees \u2013 \"the biggest single reduction ever estimated by the Climate Action Tracker\".[182] In September 2021 Xi Jinping announced that China will not build \"coal-fired power projects abroad\". The decision can be \"pivotal\" in reducing emissions. The Belt and Road Initiative did not include financing such projects already in the first half of 2021.[183]\nThe country also had significant water pollution problems: 8.2% of China's rivers had been polluted by industrial and agricultural waste in 2019.[184][185] China had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 7.14/10, ranking it 53rd globally out of 172 countries.[186] In 2020, a sweeping law was passed by the Chinese government to protect the ecology of the Yangtze River. The new laws include strengthening ecological protection rules for hydropower projects along the river, banning chemical plants within 1 kilometer of the river, relocating polluting industries, severely restricting sand mining as well as a complete fishing ban on all the natural waterways of the river, including all its major tributaries and lakes.[187]\nChina is also the world's leading investor in renewable energy and its commercialization, with $52\u00a0billion invested in 2011 alone;[188][189][190] it is a major manufacturer of renewable energy technologies and invests heavily in local-scale renewable energy projects.[191][192][193] By 2015, over 24% of China's energy was derived from renewable sources, while most notably from hydroelectric power: a total installed capacity of 197 GW makes China the largest hydroelectric power producer in the world.[194][195] China also has the largest power capacity of installed solar photovoltaics system and wind power system in the world.[196][197] Greenhouse gas emissions by China are the world's largest,[179] as is renewable energy in China.[198] Despite its emphasis on renewables, China remains deeply connected to global oil markets and next to India, has been the largest importer of Russian crude oil in 2022.[199][200]\nThe People's Republic of China is the second-largest country in the world by land area after Russia.[w][x] China's total area is generally stated as being approximately 9,600,000\u00a0km2 (3,700,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[201] Specific area figures range from 9,572,900\u00a0km2 (3,696,100\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) according to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica,[202] to 9,596,961\u00a0km2 (3,705,407\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) according to the UN Demographic Yearbook,[3] and the CIA World Factbook.[6]\nChina has the longest combined land border in the world, measuring 22,117\u00a0km (13,743\u00a0mi) and its coastline covers approximately 14,500\u00a0km (9,000\u00a0mi) from the mouth of the Yalu River (Amnok River) to the Gulf of Tonkin.[6] China borders 14 nations and covers the bulk of East Asia, bordering Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar in Southeast Asia; India, Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan[y] and Afghanistan in South Asia; Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan in Central Asia; and Russia, Mongolia, and North Korea in Inner Asia and Northeast Asia. It is narrowly separated from Bangladesh and Thailand to the southwest and south, and has several maritime neighbors such as Japan, Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia.[203]\nThe People's Republic of China is a one-party Marxist\u2013Leninist state[204] governed solely by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), making it one of the world's last countries governed by a communist party. The Chinese constitution states that the PRC \"is a socialist state governed by a people's democratic dictatorship that is led by the working class and based on an alliance of workers and peasants,\" and that the state institutions \"shall practice the principle of democratic centralism.\"[205] The main body of the constitution also declares that \"the defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).\"[206]\nAlthough the CCP describes China as a \"socialist consultative democracy\",[207] the country is commonly described as an authoritarian one-party surveillance state and a dictatorship.[208][209] China has consistently been ranked amongst the lowest as an \"authoritarian regime\" by the Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index, ranking at 156th out of 167 countries in 2022.[210] It has also been called authoritarian[210] and corporatist,[211] with amongst the heaviest restrictions worldwide in many areas, most notably against free access to the Internet, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, the right to have children, free formation of social organizations and freedom of religion.[212] Its current political, ideological and economic system has been termed by its leaders as a \"whole-process people's democracy\" \"people's democratic dictatorship\", \"socialism with Chinese characteristics\" (which is Marxism adapted to Chinese circumstances) and the \"socialist market economy\" respectively.[213][214]\nPolitical concerns in China include the growing gap between rich and poor and government corruption.[215] Nonetheless, the level of public support for the government and its management of the nation is high, with 80\u201395% of Chinese citizens expressing satisfaction with the central government, according to a 2011 Harvard University survey.[216] A 2020 survey from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research also had most Chinese expressing satisfaction with the government on information dissemination and delivery of daily necessities during the COVID-19 pandemic.[217][218] A Harvard University survey published in July 2020 found that citizen satisfaction with the government had increased since 2003, also rating China's government as more effective and capable than ever before in the survey's history.[219]\nAccording to the CCP constitution, its highest body of the CCP is the National Congress held every five years.[220] The National Congress elects the Central Committee, who then elects the party's Politburo, Politburo Standing Committee and the general secretary (party leader), the top leadership of the country.[220] The general secretary holds ultimate power and authority over state and government and serves as the informal paramount leader.[221] The current general secretary is Xi Jinping, who took office on 15 November 2012.[222] At the local level, the secretary of the CCP committee of a subdivision outranks the local government level; CCP committee secretary of a provincial division outranks the governor while the CCP committee secretary of a city outranks the mayor.[223]\nSince both the CCP and the People's Liberation Army (PLA) promote according to seniority, it is possible to discern distinct generations of Chinese leadership.[224] In official discourse, each group of leadership is identified with a distinct extension of the ideology of the party. Historians have studied various periods in the development of the government of the People's Republic of China by reference to these \"generations\".\nThe nearly 3,000 member National People's Congress (NPC) is constitutionally the \"highest state organ of power\",[205] though it has been also described as a \"rubber stamp\" body.[225] The NPC meets annually, while the NPC Standing Committee, around 150 member body elected from NPC delegates, meets every couple of months.[225] In what China calls the \"people's congress system\", local people's congresses at the lowest level[z] are officially directly elected, with all the higher-level people's congresses up to the NPC being elected by the level one below.[205] However, the elections are not pluralistic, with nominations at all levels being controlled by the CCP.[226] The NPC is dominated by the CCP, with another eight minor parties having nominal representation in the condition of upholding CCP leadership.[227]\nThe president is the ceremonial head of state, elected by the NPC. The incumbent president is Xi Jinping, who is also the general secretary of the CCP and the chairman of the Central Military Commission, making him China's paramount leader. The premier is the head of government, with Li Qiang being the incumbent premier. The premier is officially nominated by the president and then elected by the NPC, and has generally been either the second or third-ranking member of the PSC. The premier presides over the State Council, China's cabinet, composed of four vice premiers and the heads of ministries and commissions.[205] The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) is a political advisory body that is critical in China's \"united front\" system, which aims to gather non-CCP voices to support the CCP. Similar to the people's congresses, CPPCC's exist at various division, with the National Committee of the CPPCC being chaired by Wang Huning, one of China's top leaders.[228]\nThe People's Republic of China is constitutionally a unitary state officially divided into 23 provinces,[n] five autonomous regions (each with a designated minority group), and four municipalities\u2014collectively referred to as \"mainland China\"\u2014as well as the special administrative regions (SARs) of Hong Kong and Macau.[229] The PRC considers Taiwan to be its 23rd province,[230] although it is governed by the Republic of China (ROC), which claims to be the legitimate representative of China and its territory, though it has downplayed this claim since its democratization.[231] Geographically, all 31 provincial divisions of mainland China can be grouped into six regions: North China, Northeast China, East China, South Central China, Southwest China, and Northwest China.[232]\nThe PRC has diplomatic relations with 179 United Nation members states and maintains embassies in 173. Since 2019, China has the largest diplomatic network in the world.[233][234] In 1971, the PRC replaced the Republic of China (ROC) as the sole representative of China in the United Nations and as one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.[235] China was also a former member and leader of the Non-Aligned Movement, and still considers itself an advocate for developing countries.[236] Along with Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa, China is a member of the BRICS group of emerging major economies and hosted the group's third official summit at Sanya, Hainan in April 2011.[237]\nMany other countries have switched recognition from the ROC to the PRC since the latter replaced the former in the United Nations in 1971.[238] The PRC officially maintains the one-China principle, which holds the view that there is only one sovereign state in the name of China, represented by the PRC, and that Taiwan is part of that China.[239] The unique status of Taiwan has led to countries recognizing the PRC to maintain unique \"one-China policies\" that differ from each other; some countries  explicitly recognize the PRC's claim over Taiwan, while others, including the US and Japan, only acknowledge the claim.[239] Chinese officials have protested on numerous occasions when foreign countries have made diplomatic overtures to Taiwan,[240] especially in the matter of armament sales.[241]\nMuch of current Chinese foreign policy is reportedly based on Premier Zhou Enlai's Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and is also driven by the concept of \"harmony without uniformity\", which encourages diplomatic relations between states despite ideological differences.[242] This policy may have led China to support or maintain close ties with states that are regarded as dangerous or repressive by Western nations, such as Myanmar,[243] North Korea and Iran.[244] China has a close political, economic and military relationship with Russia,[245] and the two states often vote in unison in the United Nations Security Council.[246][247][248]\nChina became the world's largest trading nation in 2013 as measured by the sum of imports and exports, as well as the world's largest commodity importer. comprising roughly 45% of maritime's dry-bulk market.[249][250]\nBy 2016, China was the largest trading partner of 124 other countries.[251] China is the largest trading partner for the ASEAN nations, with a total trade value of $345.8 billion in 2015 accounting for 15.2% of ASEAN's total trade.[252] ASEAN is also China's largest trading partner.[253] In 2020, China became the largest trading partner of the European Union for goods, with the total value of goods trade reaching nearly $700 billion.[254] China, along with ASEAN, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, is a member of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the world's largest free-trade area covering 30% of the world's population and economic output.[255] China became a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001. In 2004, it proposed an entirely new East Asia Summit (EAS) framework as a forum for regional security issues.[256] The EAS, which includes ASEAN Plus Three, India, Australia and New Zealand, held its inaugural summit in 2005.[257]\nChina has had a long and complex trade relationship with the United States. In 2000, the United States Congress approved \"permanent normal trade relations\" (PNTR) with China, allowing Chinese exports in at the same low tariffs as goods from most other countries.[258] China has a significant trade surplus with the United States, its most important export market.[259] Economists have argued that the renminbi is undervalued, due to currency intervention from the Chinese government, giving China an unfair trade advantage.[260] In August 2019, the United States Department of the Treasury designated China as a \"currency manipulator\",[261] later reversing the decision in January 2020.[262] The US and other foreign governments have also alleged that China doesn't respect intellectual property (IP) rights and steals IP through espionage operations,[263][264] with the US Department of Justice saying that 80% of all the prosecutions related to economic espionage it brings were about conduct to benefit the Chinese state.[265]\nSince the turn of the century, China has followed a policy of engaging with African nations for trade and bilateral co-operation;[266][267][268] in 2019, Sino-African trade totalled $208 billion, having grown 20 times over two decades.[269] According to Madison Condon \"China finances more infrastructure projects in Africa than the World Bank and provides billions of dollars in low-interest loans to the continent's emerging economies.\"[270] China maintains extensive and highly diversified trade links with the European Union.[254] China has furthermore strengthened its trade ties with major South American economies,[271] and is the largest trading partner of Brazil, Chile, Peru, Uruguay, Argentina, and several others.[272]\nChina's Belt and Road Initiative has expanded significantly over the last six years and, as of April 2020, includes 138 countries and 30 international organizations. In addition to intensifying foreign policy relations, the focus here is particularly on building efficient transport routes. The focus is particularly on the maritime Silk Road with its connections to East Africa and Europe and there are Chinese investments or related declarations of intent at numerous ports such as Gwadar, Kuantan, Hambantota, Piraeus and Trieste. However many of these loans made under the Belt and Road program are unsustainable and China has faced a number of calls for debt relief from debtor nations.[273][274]\nEver since its establishment after the Chinese Civil War, the PRC has claimed the territories governed by the Republic of China (ROC), a separate political entity today commonly known as Taiwan, as a part of its territory. It regards the island of Taiwan as its Taiwan Province, Kinmen and Matsu as a part of Fujian Province and islands the ROC controls in the South China Sea as a part of Hainan Province and Guangdong Province. These claims are controversial because of the complicated Cross-Strait relations, with the PRC treating the One-China Principle as one of its most important diplomatic principles.[275][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]\nChina has resolved its land borders with 12 out of 14 neighboring countries, having pursued substantial compromises in most of them.[276][277][278] As of 2023, China currently has a disputed land border with India and Bhutan.[citation needed] China is additionally involved in maritime disputes with multiple countries over the ownership of several small islands in the East and South China Seas, such as Socotra Rock, the Senkaku Islands and the entirety of South China Sea Islands,[279][280] along with the EEZ disputes over East China Sea.\nChina uses a massive espionage network of cameras, facial recognition software, sensors, and surveillance of personal technology as a means of social control of persons living in the country.[281] The Chinese democracy movement, social activists, and some members of the CCP like Wang Yang[282] believe in the need for social and political reform. While economic and social controls have been significantly relaxed in China since the 1970s, political freedom is still tightly restricted. The Constitution of the People's Republic of China states that the \"fundamental rights\" of citizens include freedom of speech, freedom of the press, the right to a fair trial, freedom of religion, universal suffrage, and property rights. However, in practice, these provisions do not afford significant protection against criminal prosecution by the state.[283][284] Although some criticisms of government policies and the ruling CCP are tolerated, censorship of political speech and information, most notably on the Internet,[285][286] are routinely used to prevent collective action.[287]\nA number of foreign governments, foreign press agencies, and non-governmental organizations have criticized China's human rights record, alleging widespread civil rights violations such as detention without trial, forced abortions,[288] forced confessions, torture, restrictions of fundamental rights,[212][289] and excessive use of the death penalty.[290][291] The government suppresses popular protests and demonstrations that it considers a potential threat to \"social stability\", as was the case with the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre.[292]\nChina is regularly accused of large-scale repression and human rights abuses in Tibet and Xinjiang,[294][295][296] including violent police crackdowns and religious suppression.[297][298] In Xinjiang, at least one million Uyghurs and other ethnic and religion minorities have been detained in internment camps, officially termed \"Vocational Education and Training Centers\", aimed at changing the political thinking of detainees, their identities, and their religious beliefs.[141] According to the U.S. Department of State, actions including political indoctrination, torture, physical and psychological abuse, forced sterilization, sexual abuse, and forced labor are common in these facilities.[299] The state has also sought to control offshore reporting of tensions in Xinjiang, intimidating foreign-based reporters by detaining their family members.[300] According to a 2020 report, China's treatment of Uyghurs meets the UN definition of genocide,[301] and several groups called for a UN investigation.[302] Several countries have recognized China's actions in Xinjiang as a genocide.[303][293][304]\nGlobal studies from Pew Research Center in 2014 and 2017 ranked the Chinese government's restrictions on religion as among the highest in the world, despite low to moderate rankings for religious-related social hostilities in the country.[305][306] The Global Slavery Index estimated that in 2016 more than 3.8 million people were living in \"conditions of modern slavery\", or 0.25% of the population, including victims of human trafficking, forced labor, forced marriage, child labor, and state-imposed forced labor. The state-imposed forced system was formally abolished in 2013, but it is not clear to which extent its various practices have stopped.[307] The Chinese penal system includes labor prison factories, detention centers, and re-education camps, collectively known as laogai (\"reform through labor\"). The Laogai Research Foundation in the United States estimated that there were over a thousand slave labor prisons and camps in China.[308]\nThe People's Liberation Army (PLA) is considered one of the world's most powerful militaries and has rapidly modernized in the recent decades.[309] It consists of the Ground Force (PLAGF), the Navy (PLAN), the Air Force (PLAAF), the Rocket Force (PLARF) and the Strategic Support Force (PLASSF). Its nearly 2.2 million active duty personnel is the largest in the world. The PLA holds the world's third-largest stockpile of nuclear weapons,[310][311] and the world's second-largest navy by tonnage.[312] China's official military budget for 2022 totalled US$230 billion (1.45 trillion Yuan), the second-largest in the world. According to SIPRI estimates, its military spending from 2012 to 2021 averaged US$215 billion per year or 1.7 per cent of GDP, behind only the United States at US$734 billion per year or 3.6 per cent of GDP.[313] The PLA is commanded by the Central Military Commission (CMC) of the party and the state; though officially two separate organizations, the two CMCs have identical membership except during leadership transition periods and effectively function as one organization. The chairman of the CMC is the commander-in-chief of the PLA, with the officeholder also generally being the CCP general secretary, making them the paramount leader of China.[314]\nChina has the world's second-largest economy in terms of nominal GDP,[315] and the world's largest economy in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP).[316] As of 2021, China accounts for around 18% of the world economy by GDP nominal.[317] China is one of the world's fastest-growing major economies,[318] with its economic growth having been consistently above 6 percent since the introduction of economic reforms in 1978.[319] According to the World Bank, China's GDP grew from $150 billion in 1978 to $17.73 trillion by 2021.[320] Of the world's 500 largest companies, 145 are headquartered in China.[321]\nChina was one of the world's most most foremost economic powers throughout the arc of East Asian and global history. The country had one of the largest economies in the world for most of the past two millennia,[322] during which it has seen cycles of prosperity and decline.[323][324] Since economic reforms began in 1978, China has developed into a highly diversified economy and one of the most consequential players in international trade. Major sectors of competitive strength include manufacturing, retail, mining, steel, textiles, automobiles, energy generation, green energy, banking, electronics, telecommunications, real estate, e-commerce, and tourism. China has three out of the ten largest stock exchanges in the world[325]\u2014Shanghai, Hong Kong and Shenzhen\u2014that together have a market capitalization of over $15.9 trillion, as of October 2020.[326] China has four (Shanghai, Hong Kong, Beijing, and Shenzhen) out of the world's top ten most competitive financial centers, which is more than any country in the 2020 Global Financial Centres Index.[327] By 2035, China's four cities (Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen) are projected to be among the global top ten largest cities by nominal GDP according to a report by Oxford Economics.[328]\nModern-day China is often described as an example of state capitalism or party-state capitalism.[330][331] In 1992, Jiang Zemin termed the country a socialist market economy.[332] Others have described it as a form of Marxism\u2013Leninism adapted to co-exist with global capitalism.[333] The state dominates in strategic \"pillar\" sectors such as energy production and heavy industries, but private enterprise has expanded enormously, with around 30\u00a0million private businesses recorded in 2008.[334][335][336] According to official statistics, privately owned companies constitute more than 60% of China's GDP.[337]\nChina has been the world's largest manufacturing nation since 2010, after overtaking the US, which had been the largest for the previous hundred years.[338][339] China has also been the second largest in high-tech manufacturing since 2012, according to US National Science Foundation.[340] China is the second largest retail market in the world, next to the United States.[341] China leads the world in e-commerce, accounting for 40% of the global market share in 2016[342] and more than 50% of the global market share in 2019.[343] China is the world's leader in electric vehicle consumption and production, manufacturing and buying half of all the plug-in electric cars (BEV and PHEV) in the world as of 2022.[344] China is also the leading producer of batteries for electric vehicles as well as several key raw materials for batteries.[345] China had 174 GW of installed solar capacity by the end of 2018, which amounts to more than 40% of the global solar capacity.[346][347]\nChina accounted for 17.9% of the world's total wealth in 2021, second highest in the world after the US.[348] It ranks at 65th at GDP (nominal) per capita, making it an upper-middle income country.[349] China brought more people out of extreme poverty than any other country in history[350][351]\u2014between 1978 and 2018, China reduced extreme poverty by 800 million. China reduced the extreme poverty rate\u2014per international standard, it refers to an income of less than $1.90/day\u2014from 88% in 1981 to 1.85% by 2013.[352] The portion of people in China living below the international poverty line of $1.90 per day (2011 PPP) fell to 0.3% in 2018 from 66.3% in 1990. Using the lower-middle income poverty line of $3.20 per day, the portion fell to 2.9% in 2018 from 90.0% in 1990. Using the upper-middle income poverty line of $5.50 per day, the portion fell to 17.0% from 98.3% in 1990.[353]\nFrom 1978 to 2018, the average standard of living multiplied by a factor of twenty-six.[354] Wages in China have grown a lot in the last 40 years\u2014real (inflation-adjusted) wages grew seven-fold from 1978 to 2007.[355] Per capita incomes have risen significantly \u2013 when the PRC was founded in 1949, per capita income in China was one-fifth of the world average; per capita incomes now equal the world average itself.[354] China's development is highly uneven. Its major cities and coastal areas are far more prosperous compared to rural and interior regions.[356] It has a high level of economic inequality,[357] which has increased in the past few decades.[358] In 2019 China's Gini coefficient was 0.382, according to the World Bank.[12]\nAs of 2020, China was second in the world, after the US, in total number of billionaires and total number of millionaires, with 698 Chinese billionaires and 4.4 million millionaires.[359] In 2019, China overtook the US as the home to the highest number of people who have a net personal wealth of at least $110,000, according to the global wealth report by Credit Suisse.[360][361] According to the Hurun Global Rich List 2020, China is home to five of the world's top ten cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and Guangzhou in the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 10th spots, respectively) by the highest number of billionaires, which is more than any other country.[362] China had 85 female billionaires as of January 2021, two-thirds of the global total, and minted 24 new female billionaires in 2020.[363] China has had the world's largest middle-class population since 2015,[364] and the middle-class grew to a size of 400 million by 2018.[365]\nChina is a member of the WTO and is the world's largest trading power, with a total international trade value of US$4.62\u00a0trillion in 2018.[367] China is the world's largest exporter and second-largest importer of goods.[368] Its foreign exchange reserves reached US$3.1\u00a0trillion as of 2019,[369] making its reserves by far the world's largest.[370][371] In 2012, China was the world's largest recipient of inward foreign direct investment (FDI), attracting $253 billion.[372] In 2014, China's foreign exchange remittances were $US64 billion making it the second largest recipient of remittances in the world.[373] China also invests abroad, with a total outward FDI of $62.4\u00a0billion in 2012,[372] and a number of major takeovers of foreign firms by Chinese companies.[374] China is a major owner of US public debt, holding trillions of dollars worth of U.S. Treasury bonds.[375][376] China's undervalued exchange rate has caused friction with other major economies,[377] and it has also been widely criticized for manufacturing large quantities of counterfeit goods.[378][379]\nFollowing the 2007\u201308 financial crisis, Chinese authorities sought to actively wean off of its dependence on the U.S. dollar as a result of perceived weaknesses of the international monetary system.[380] To achieve those ends, China took a series of actions to further the internationalization of the Renminbi. In 2008, China established the dim sum bond market and expanded the Cross-Border Trade RMB Settlement Pilot Project, which helps establish pools of offshore RMB liquidity.[381][382] This was followed with bilateral agreements to settle trades directly in renminbi with Russia,[383] Japan,[384] Australia,[385] Singapore,[386] the United Kingdom,[387] and Canada.[388] As a result of the rapid internationalization of the renminbi, it became the eighth-most-traded currency in the world by 2018, an emerging international reserve currency,[389] and a component of the IMF's special drawing rights; however, partly due to capital controls that make the renminbi fall short of being a fully convertible currency, it remains far behind the Euro, Dollar and Japanese Yen in international trade volumes.[390] As of 2022, Yuan is the world's fifth-most traded currency.[391]\nChina was a world leader in science and technology until the Ming dynasty.[392] Ancient Chinese discoveries and inventions, such as papermaking, printing, the compass, and gunpowder (the Four Great Inventions), became widespread across East Asia, the Middle East and later Europe. Chinese mathematicians were the first to use negative numbers.[393][394] By the 17th century, the Western hemisphere surpassed China in scientific and technological advancement.[395] The causes of this early modern Great Divergence continue to be debated by scholars.[396]\nAfter repeated military defeats by the European colonial powers and Japan in the 19th century, Chinese reformers began promoting modern science and technology as part of the Self-Strengthening Movement. After the Communists came to power in 1949, efforts were made to organize science and technology based on the model of the Soviet Union, in which scientific research was part of central planning.[397] After Mao's death in 1976, science and technology were promoted as one of the Four Modernizations,[398] and the Soviet-inspired academic system was gradually reformed.[399]\nSince the end of the Cultural Revolution, China has made significant investments in scientific research[401] and is quickly catching up with the US in R&D spending.[402][403] China officially spent around 2.4% of its GDP on R&D in 2020, totaling to around $377.8 billion.[404] According to the World Intellectual Property Indicators, China received more applications than the US did in 2018 and 2019 and ranked first globally in patents, utility models, trademarks, industrial designs, and creative goods exports in 2021.[405][406][407] It was ranked 11th in the Global Innovation Index in 2022, a considerable improvement from its rank of 35th in 2013.[408][409][410][411] Chinese supercomputers have been ranked the fastest in the world on a few occasions;[412] however, these supercomputers rely on critical components\u2014namely processors\u2014imported from outside of China.[413] China has also struggled with developing several technologies domestically, such as the most advanced semiconductors and reliable jet engines.[414][415]\nChina is developing its education system with an emphasis on science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).[416] It became the world's largest publisher of scientific papers in 2016.[417][418][419] Chinese-born academicians have won prestigious prizes in the sciences and in mathematics, although most of them had conducted their winning research in Western nations.[aa][improper synthesis?]\nThe Chinese space program started in 1958 with some technology transfers from the Soviet Union. However, it did not launch the nation's first satellite until 1970 with the Dong Fang Hong I, which made China the fifth country to do so independently.[426] In 2003, China became the third country in the world to independently send humans into space with Yang Liwei's spaceflight aboard Shenzhou 5. as of 2022[update], sixteen Chinese nationals have journeyed into space, including two women. In 2011, China launched its first space station testbed, Tiangong-1.[427] In 2013, a Chinese robotic rover Yutu successfully touched down on the lunar surface as part of the Chang'e 3 mission.[428] In 2019, China became the first country to land a probe\u2014Chang'e 4\u2014on the far side of the Moon.[429] In 2020, Chang'e 5 successfully returned moon samples to the Earth, making China the third country to do so independently after the United States and the Soviet Union.[430] In 2021, China became the second nation in history to independently land a rover (Zhurong) on Mars, after the United States.[431] China completed its own modular space station, the Tiangong, in low Earth orbit on 3 November 2022.[432][433][434] On 29 November 2022, China performed its first in-orbit crew handover aboard the Tiangong.[435][436]\nAfter a decades-long infrastructural boom,[437] China has produced numerous world-leading infrastructural projects: China has the world's largest bullet train network,[438] the most supertall skyscrapers in the world,[439] the world's largest power plant (the Three Gorges Dam),[440] the largest energy generation capacity in the world,[441] a global satellite navigation system with the largest number of satellites in the world,[442] and has initiated the Belt and Road Initiative, a large global infrastructure building initiative with funding on the order of $50\u2013100 billion per year.[443] The Belt and Road Initiative could be one of the largest development plans in modern history.[444]\nChina is the largest telecom market in the world and currently has the largest number of active cellphones of any country in the world, with over 1.5 billion subscribers, as of 2018.[445][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] It also has the world's largest number of internet and broadband users, with over 800 million Internet users as of 2018[update]\u2014equivalent to around 60% of its population\u2014and almost all of them being mobile as well.[446] By 2018, China had more than 1 billion 4G users, accounting for 40% of world's total.[447] China is making rapid advances in 5G\u2014by late 2018, China had started large-scale and commercial 5G trials.[448]\nChina Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom, are the three large providers of mobile and internet in China. China Telecom alone served more than 145 million broadband subscribers and 300 million mobile users; China Unicom had about 300 million subscribers; and China Mobile, the largest of them all, had 925 million users, as of 2018.[449] Combined, the three operators had over 3.4 million 4G base-stations in China.[450] Several Chinese telecommunications companies, most notably Huawei and ZTE, have been accused of spying for the Chinese military.[451]\nChina has developed its own satellite navigation system, dubbed Beidou, which began offering commercial navigation services across Asia in 2012[452] as well as global services by the end of 2018.[453][454] Upon the completion of the 35th Beidou satellite, which was launched into orbit on 23 June 2020, Beidou followed GPS and GLONASS as the third completed global navigation satellite in the world.[455]\nSince the late 1990s, China's national road network has been significantly expanded through the creation of a network of national highways and expressways. In 2018, China's highways had reached a total length of 142,500\u00a0km (88,500\u00a0mi), making it the longest highway system in the world.[456][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] China has the world's largest market for automobiles, having surpassed the United States in both auto sales and production. A side-effect of the rapid growth of China's road network has been a significant rise in traffic accidents,[457] though the number of fatalities in traffic accidents fell by 20% from 2007 to 2017.[458][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] In urban areas, bicycles remain a common mode of transport, despite the increasing prevalence of automobiles \u2013 as of 2012[update], there are approximately 470 million bicycles in China.[459]\nChina's railways, which are state-owned, are among the busiest in the world, handling a quarter of the world's rail traffic volume on only 6 percent of the world's tracks in 2006.[460][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] As of 2017, the country had 127,000\u00a0km (78,914\u00a0mi) of railways, the second longest network in the world.[461] The railways strain to meet enormous demand particularly during the Chinese New Year holiday, when the world's largest annual human migration takes place.[462]\nChina's high-speed rail (HSR) system started construction in the early 2000s. By the end of 2020, high speed rail in China had reached 37,900 kilometers (23,550 miles) of dedicated lines alone, making it the longest HSR network in the world.[463][464] Services on the Beijing\u2013Shanghai, Beijing\u2013Tianjin, and Chengdu\u2013Chongqing Lines reach up to 350\u00a0km/h (217\u00a0mph), making them the fastest conventional high speed railway services in the world. With an annual ridership of over 2.29 billion passengers in 2019 it is the world's busiest.[465][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] The network includes the Beijing\u2013Guangzhou\u2013Shenzhen High-Speed Railway, the single longest HSR line in the world, and the Beijing\u2013Shanghai High-Speed Railway, which has three of longest railroad bridges in the world.[466] The Shanghai Maglev Train, which reaches 431\u00a0km/h (268\u00a0mph), is the fastest commercial train service in the world.[467]\nSince 2000, the growth of rapid transit systems in Chinese cities has accelerated.[468] As of January\u00a02021[update], 44 Chinese cities have urban mass transit systems in operation[469] and 39 more have metro systems approved.[470] As of 2020, China boasts the five longest metro systems in the world with the networks in Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Shenzhen being the largest.\nThere were approximately 229 airports in 2017, with around 240 planned by 2020. China has over 2,000 river and seaports, about 130 of which are open to foreign shipping.[471] In 2017, the Ports of Shanghai, Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Ningbo-Zhoushan, Guangzhou, Qingdao and Tianjin ranked in the Top 10 in the world in container traffic and cargo tonnage.[472]\nWater supply and sanitation infrastructure in China is facing challenges such as rapid urbanization, as well as water scarcity, contamination, and pollution.[473] According to data presented by the Joint Monitoring Program for Water Supply and Sanitation of WHO and UNICEF in 2015, about 36% of the rural population in China still did not have access to improved sanitation.[474] The ongoing South\u2013North Water Transfer Project intends to abate water shortage in the north.[475]\nThe national census of 2020 recorded the population of the People's Republic of China as approximately 1,411,778,724. According to the 2020 census, about 17.95% of the population were 14 years old or younger, 63.35% were between 15 and 59 years old, and 18.7% were over 60 years old.[8] The population growth rate for 2013 is estimated to be 0.46%.[476] China used to make up much of the world's poor; now it makes up much of the world's middle-class.[477] Although a middle-income country by Western standards, China's rapid growth has pulled hundreds of millions\u2014800 million, to be more precise[478]\u2014of its people out of poverty since 1978. By 2013, less than 2% of the Chinese population lived below the international poverty line of US$1.9 per day, down from 88% in 1981.[352] From 2009 to 2018, the unemployment rate in China has averaged about 4%.[479]\nGiven concerns about population growth, China implemented a two-child limit during the 1970s, and, in 1979, began to advocate for an even stricter limit of one child per family. Beginning in the mid-1980s, however, given the unpopularity of the strict limits, China began to allow some major exemptions, particularly in rural areas, resulting in what was actually a \"1.5\"-child policy from the mid-1980s to 2015 (ethnic minorities were also exempt from one child limits). The next major loosening of the policy was enacted in December 2013, allowing families to have two children if one parent is an only child.[480] In 2016, the one-child policy was replaced in favor of a two-child policy.[481] A three-child policy was announced on 31 May 2021, due to population aging,[482] and in July 2021, all family size limits as well as penalties for exceeding them were removed.[483] According to data from the 2020 census, China's total fertility rate is 1.3, but some experts believe that after adjusting for the transient effects of the relaxation of restrictions, the country's actual total fertility rate is as low as 1.1.[484] In 2023, National Bureau of Statistics estimated that the population fell 850,000 from 2021 to 2022, the first decline since 1961.[485]\nAccording to one group of scholars, one-child limits had little effect on population growth[486] or the size of the total population.[487] However, these scholars have been challenged. Their own counterfactual model of fertility decline without such restrictions implies that China averted more than 500 million births between 1970 and 2015, a number which may reach one billion by 2060 given all the lost descendants of births averted during the era of fertility restrictions, with one-child restrictions accounting for the great bulk of that reduction.[488] The policy, along with traditional preference for boys, may have contributed to an imbalance in the sex ratio at birth.[489][490] According to the 2010 census, the sex ratio at birth was 118.06 boys for every 100 girls,[491] which is beyond the normal range of around 105 boys for every 100 girls.[492] The 2010 census found that males accounted for 51.27 percent of the total population.[491] However, China's sex ratio is more balanced than it was in 1953, when males accounted for 51.82 percent of the total population.[491]\nChina legally recognizes 56 distinct ethnic groups, who altogether comprise the Zhonghua Minzu. The largest of these nationalities are the Han Chinese, who constitute more than 91% of the total\npopulation.[493] The Han Chinese \u2013 the world's largest single ethnic group[494] \u2013 outnumber other ethnic groups in every provincial-level division except Tibet and Xinjiang.[495] Ethnic minorities account for less than 10% of the population of China, according to the 2020 census.[493] Compared with the 2010 population census, the Han population increased by 60,378,693 persons, or 4.93%, while the population of the 55 national minorities combined increased by 11,675,179 persons, or 10.26%.[493] The 2020 census recorded a total of 845,697 foreign nationals living in mainland China.[496]\nThere are as many as 292 living languages in China.[497] The languages most commonly spoken belong to the Sinitic branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family, which contains Mandarin (spoken by 70% of the population),[498] and other varieties of Chinese language: Yue (including Cantonese and Taishanese), Wu (including Shanghainese and Suzhounese), Min (including Fuzhounese, Hokkien and Teochew), Xiang, Gan and Hakka. Languages of the Tibeto-Burman branch, including Tibetan, Qiang, Naxi and Yi, are spoken across the Tibetan and Yunnan\u2013Guizhou Plateau. Other ethnic minority languages in southwest China include Zhuang, Thai, Dong and Sui of the Tai-Kadai family, Miao and Yao of the Hmong\u2013Mien family, and Wa of the Austroasiatic family. Across northeastern and northwestern China, local ethnic groups speak Altaic languages including Manchu, Mongolian and several Turkic languages: Uyghur, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Salar and Western Yugur. Korean is spoken natively along the border with North Korea. Sarikoli, the language of Tajiks in western Xinjiang, is an Indo-European language. Taiwanese aborigines, including a small population on the mainland, speak Austronesian languages.[499]\nStandard Mandarin, a variety of Mandarin based on the Beijing dialect, is the official national language of China and is used as a lingua franca in the country between people of different linguistic backgrounds.[500][501] Mongolian, Uyghur, Tibetan, Zhuang and various other languages are also regionally recognized throughout the country.[502]\nChina has urbanized significantly in recent decades. The percent of the country's population living in urban areas increased from 20% in 1980 to over 64% in 2021.[503][504][505] It is estimated that China's urban population will reach one billion by 2030, potentially equivalent to one-eighth of the world population.[506][504]\nChina has over 160 cities with a population of over one million,[507] including the 17 megacities as of 2021[508][509] (cities with a population of over 10 million) of Chongqing, Shanghai, Beijing, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Xi'an, Suzhou, Zhengzhou, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Linyi, Shijiazhuang, Dongguan, Qingdao and Changsha.[510] Among them, the total permanent population of Chongqing, Shanghai, Beijing and Chengdu is above 20 million.[511] Shanghai is China's most populous urban area[512][513] while Chongqing is its largest city proper, the only city in China with the largest permanent population of over 30 million.[514] By 2025, it is estimated that the country will be home to 221 cities with over a million inhabitants.[506] The figures in the table below are from the 2017 census,[515] and are only estimates of the urban populations within administrative city limits; a different ranking exists when considering the total municipal populations (which includes suburban and rural populations). The large \"floating populations\" of migrant workers make conducting censuses in urban areas difficult;[516] the figures below include only long-term residents.[citation needed]\nSince 1986, compulsory education in China comprises primary and junior secondary school, which together last for nine years.[522] In 2021, about 91.4 percent of students continued their education at a three-year senior secondary school.[523] The Gaokao, China's national university entrance exam, is a prerequisite for entrance into most higher education institutions. As of 2020, 58.42 percent of secondary school graduates were enrolled in higher education.[524] Vocational education is available to students at the secondary and tertiary level.[525] More than 10 million Chinese students graduated from vocational colleges nationwide every year.[526]\nChina has the largest education system in the world, with about 282 million students and 17.32 million full-time teachers in over 530,000 schools.[527] In February 2006, the government pledged to provide completely free nine-year education, including textbooks and fees.[528] Annual education investment went from less than US$50 billion in 2003 to more than US$817 billion in 2020.[529][530] However, there remains an inequality in education spending. In 2010, the annual education expenditure per secondary school student in Beijing totalled \u00a520,023, while in Guizhou, one of the poorest provinces in China, only totalled \u00a53,204.[531] Free compulsory education in China consists of primary school and junior secondary school between the ages of 6 and 15. In 2020, the graduation enrollment ratio at compulsory education level reached 95.2 percent, exceeding average levels recorded in high-income countries,[527] and around 91.2% of Chinese have received secondary education.[525]\nChina's literacy rate has grown dramatically, from only 20% in 1949 and 65.5% in 1979.[532] to 97% of the population over age 15 in 2018.[533] In the same year, China (Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang) was ranked the highest in the world in the Programme for International Student Assessment ranking for all three categories of Mathematics, Science and Reading.[534]\nAs of 2021, China has over 3,000 universities, with over 44.3 million students enrolled in mainland China and 240 million Chinese citizens have received high education, making China the largest higher education system in the world.[535][536][537] As of 2021, China had the world's second-highest number of top universities (the highest in Asia & Oceania region).[538] Currently, China trails only the United States in terms of representation on lists of top 200 universities according to the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU).[539] China is home to the two of the highest ranking universities (Tsinghua University and Peking University) in Asia and emerging economies according to the Times Higher Education World University Rankings.[540] As of 2022, two universities in Mainland China rank in the world's top 15, with Peking University (12th) and Tsinghua University (14th) and three other universities ranking in the world's top 50, namely Fudan, Zhejiang, and Shanghai Jiao Tong according to the QS World University Rankings.[541] These universities are members of the C9 League, an alliance of elite Chinese universities offering comprehensive and leading education.[542]\nThe National Health and Family Planning Commission, together with its counterparts in the local commissions, oversees the health needs of the Chinese population.[543] An emphasis on public health and preventive medicine has characterized Chinese health policy since the early 1950s. At that time, the Communist Party started the Patriotic Health Campaign, which was aimed at improving sanitation and hygiene, as well as treating and preventing several diseases. Diseases such as cholera, typhoid and scarlet fever, which were previously rife in China, were nearly eradicated by the campaign.[citation needed]\nAfter Deng Xiaoping began instituting economic reforms in 1978, the health of the Chinese public improved rapidly because of better nutrition, although many of the free public health services provided in the countryside disappeared along with the People's Communes. Healthcare in China became mostly privatized, and experienced a significant rise in quality. In 2009, the government began a 3-year large-scale healthcare provision initiative worth US$124 billion.[544] By 2011, the campaign resulted in 95% of China's population having basic health insurance coverage.[545] In 2011, China was estimated to be the world's third-largest supplier of pharmaceuticals, but its population has suffered from the development and distribution of counterfeit medications.[546]\nAs of 2020[update], the average life expectancy at birth in China is 78 years,[547] and the infant mortality rate is 5 per thousand (in 2021).[548] Both have improved significantly since the 1950s.[ab] Rates of stunting, a condition caused by malnutrition, have declined from 33.1% in 1990 to 9.9% in 2010.[551] Despite significant improvements in health and the construction of advanced medical facilities, China has several emerging public health problems, such as respiratory illnesses caused by widespread air pollution,[552] hundreds of millions of cigarette smokers,[553] and an increase in obesity among urban youths.[554][555] China's large population and densely populated cities have led to serious disease outbreaks in recent years, such as the 2003 outbreak of SARS, although this has since been largely contained.[556] In 2010, air pollution caused 1.2 million premature deaths in China.[557]\nThe COVID-19 pandemic was first identified in Wuhan in December 2019.[558][559] Further studies are being carried out around the world on a possible origin for the virus.[560][561] Beijing says it has been sharing Covid data in \"a timely, open and transparent manner in accordance with the law\".[562] According to U.S. officials, the Chinese government has been concealing the extent of the outbreak before it became an international pandemic.[563]\nThe government of the People's Republic of China officially espouses state atheism,[568] and has conducted antireligious campaigns to this end.[569] Religious affairs and issues in the country are overseen by the State Administration for Religious Affairs.[570] Freedom of religion is guaranteed by China's constitution, although religious organizations that lack official approval can be subject to state persecution.[289][571]\nOver the millennia, Chinese civilization has been influenced by various religious movements. The \"three teachings\", including Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism (Chinese Buddhism), historically have a significant role in shaping Chinese culture,[572][573] enriching a theological and spiritual framework which harks back to the early Shang and Zhou dynasty. Chinese popular or folk religion, which is framed by the three teachings and other traditions,[574] consists in allegiance to the shen (\u795e), a character that signifies the \"energies of generation\", who can be deities of the environment or ancestral principles of human groups, concepts of civility, culture heroes, many of whom feature in Chinese mythology and history.[575] Among the most popular cults are those of Mazu (goddess of the seas),[576] Huangdi (one of the two divine patriarchs of the Chinese race),[576][577] Guandi (god of war and business), Caishen (god of prosperity and richness), Pangu and many others. China is home to many of the world's tallest religious statues, including the tallest of all, the Spring Temple Buddha in Henan.[578]\nClear data on religious affiliation in China is difficult to gather due to varying definitions of \"religion\" and the unorganized, diffusive nature of Chinese religious traditions. Scholars note that in China there is no clear boundary between three teachings religions and local folk religious practice.[572] A 2015 poll conducted by Gallup International found that 61% of Chinese people self-identified as \"convinced atheist\",[579] though it is worthwhile to note that Chinese religions or some of their strands are definable as non-theistic and humanistic religions, since they do not believe that divine creativity is completely transcendent, but it is inherent in the world and in particular in the human being.[580] According to a 2014 study, approximately 74% are either non-religious or practice Chinese folk belief, 16% are Buddhists, 2% are Christians, 1% are Muslims, and 8% adhere to other religions including Taoists and folk salvationism.[581] In addition to Han people's local religious practices, there are also various ethnic minority groups in China who maintain their traditional autochthone religions. The various folk religions today comprise 2\u20133% of the population, while Confucianism as a religious self-identification is common within the intellectual class. Significant faiths specifically connected to certain ethnic groups include Tibetan Buddhism and the Islamic religion of the Hui, Uyghur, Kazakh, Kyrgyz and other peoples in Northwest China.[citation needed] The 2010 population census reported the total number of Muslims in the country as 23.14 million.\nA 2021 poll from Ipsos and the Policy Institute at King's College London found that 35% of Chinese people said there was tension between different religious groups, which was the second lowest percentage of the 28 countries surveyed.[582][583]\nSince ancient times, Chinese culture has been heavily influenced by Confucianism. For much of the country's dynastic era, opportunities for social advancement could be provided by high performance in the prestigious imperial examinations, which have their origins in the Han dynasty.[585] The literary emphasis of the exams affected the general perception of cultural refinement in China, such as the belief that calligraphy, poetry and painting were higher forms of art than dancing or drama. Chinese culture has long emphasized a sense of deep history and a largely inward-looking national perspective.[586] Examinations and a culture of merit remain greatly valued in China today.[587]\nThe first leaders of the People's Republic of China were born into the traditional imperial order but were influenced by the May Fourth Movement and reformist ideals. They sought to change some traditional aspects of Chinese culture, such as rural land tenure, sexism, and the Confucian system of education, while preserving others, such as the family structure and culture of obedience to the state. Some observers see the period following the establishment of the PRC in 1949 as a continuation of traditional Chinese dynastic history, while others claim that the Communist Party's rule has damaged the foundations of Chinese culture, especially through political movements such as the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s, where many aspects of traditional culture were destroyed, having been denounced as \"regressive and harmful\" or \"vestiges of feudalism\". Many important aspects of traditional Chinese morals and culture, such as Confucianism, art, literature, and performing arts like Peking opera,[589] were altered to conform to government policies and propaganda at the time. Access to foreign media remains heavily restricted.[590]\nToday, the Chinese government has accepted numerous elements of traditional Chinese culture as being integral to Chinese society. With the rise of Chinese nationalism and the end of the Cultural Revolution, various forms of traditional Chinese art, literature, music, film, fashion and architecture have seen a vigorous revival,[591][592] and folk and variety art in particular have sparked interest nationally and even worldwide.[593]\nMany architectural masters and masterpieces emerged in ancient China, creating many palaces, tombs, temples, gardens, houses, etc.The architecture of China is as old as Chinese civilization.[595] The first communities that can be identified culturally as Chinese were settled chiefly in the basin of the Yellow River(\u9ec3\u6cb3\u6d41\u57df).[596] Chinese architecture is the embodiment of an architectural style that has developed over millennia in China and has remained a vestigial source of perennial influence on the development of East Asian architecture.[597][598][599][600] Since its emergence during the early ancient era, the structural principles of its architecture have remained largely unchanged. The main changes involved diverse decorative details. Starting with the Tang dynasty,[601] Chinese architecture has had a major influence on the architectural styles of neighboring East Asian countries such as Japan, Korea, and Mongolia.[602] and minor influences on the architecture of Southeast and South Asia including the countries of Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam and the Philippines.[603][604][605] Unfortunately, few ancient Chinese buildings survive today, but reconstructions can be made based on clay models, descriptions in contemporary texts, and depictions in art such as wall paintings and engraved bronze vessels.[602]\nChinese architecture is characterized by bilateral symmetry, use of enclosed open spaces, feng shui (e.g. directional hierarchies),[607] a horizontal emphasis, and an allusion to various cosmological, mythological or in general symbolic elements. Chinese architecture traditionally classifies structures according to type, ranging from pagodas to palaces.[595][602]\nChinese architecture varies widely based on status or affiliation, such as whether the structures were constructed for emperors, commoners, or for religious purposes. Other variations in Chinese architecture are shown in vernacular styles associated with different geographic regions and different ethnic heritages,such as the Stilt houses in the south, the Yaodong buildings in the northwest, the yurt buildings of nomadic people, and the Siheyuan buildings in the north.[608]\nSince the end of the Qing Dynasty, Western-style architecture has gradually become the mainstream architectural form in China, while Chinese-style architecture has gradually declined in the form of appearance.[595]\nChina received 55.7\u00a0million inbound international visitors in 2010,[609] and in 2012 was the third-most-visited country in the world.[610] It also experiences an enormous volume of domestic tourism; an estimated 740 million Chinese holidaymakers traveled within the country in October 2012.[611] China hosts the world's second-largest number of World Heritage Sites (56) after Italy, and is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world (first in the Asia-Pacific).The number of domestic trips reached six billion in 2019.[612]\nChinese literature is based on the literature of the Zhou dynasty.[613] Concepts covered within the Chinese classic texts present a wide range of thoughts and subjects including calendar, military, astrology, herbology, geography and many others.[614] Some of the most important early texts include the I Ching and the Shujing within the Four Books and Five Classics which served as the Confucian authoritative books for the state-sponsored curriculum in dynastic era. Inherited from the Classic of Poetry, classical Chinese poetry developed to its floruit during the Tang dynasty. Li Bai and Du Fu opened the forking ways for the poetic circles through romanticism and realism respectively. Chinese historiography began with the Shiji, the overall scope of the historiographical tradition in China is termed the Twenty-Four Histories, which set a vast stage for Chinese fictions along with Chinese mythology and folklore.[615] Pushed by a burgeoning citizen class in the Ming dynasty, Chinese classical fiction rose to a boom of the historical, town and gods and demons fictions as represented by the Four Great Classical Novels which include Water Margin, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Journey to the West and Dream of the Red Chamber.[616] Along with the wuxia fictions of Jin Yong and Liang Yusheng,[617] it remains an enduring source of popular culture in the Chinese sphere of influence.[618]\nIn the wake of the New Culture Movement after the end of the Qing dynasty, Chinese literature embarked on a new era with written vernacular Chinese for ordinary citizens. Hu Shih and Lu Xun were pioneers in modern literature.[619] Various literary genres, such as misty poetry, scar literature, young adult fiction and the xungen literature, which is influenced by magic realism,[620] emerged following the Cultural Revolution. Mo Yan, a xungen literature author, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2012.[621]\nChinese cuisine is highly diverse, drawing on several millennia of culinary history and geographical variety, in which the most influential are known as the \"Eight Major Cuisines\", including Sichuan, Cantonese, Jiangsu, Shandong, Fujian, Hunan, Anhui, and Zhejiang cuisines.[622] Chinese cuisine is also known for its width of cooking methods and ingredients,[623] as well as food therapy that is emphasized by traditional Chinese medicine.[624][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] Generally, China's staple food is rice in the south, wheat-based breads and noodles in the north. The diet of the common people in pre-modern times was largely grain and simple vegetables, with meat reserved for special occasions. The bean products, such as tofu and soy milk, remain as a popular source of protein. Pork is now the most popular meat in China, accounting for about three-fourths of the country's total meat consumption.[625] While pork dominates the meat market, there is also the vegetarian Buddhist cuisine and the pork-free Chinese Islamic cuisine. Southern cuisine, due to the area's proximity to the ocean and milder climate, has a wide variety of seafood and vegetables; it differs in many respects from the wheat-based diets across dry northern China. Numerous offshoots of Chinese food, such as Hong Kong cuisine and American Chinese food, have emerged in the nations that play host to the Chinese diaspora.[citation needed]\nChinese music covers a highly diverse range of music from traditional music to modern music. Chinese music dates back before the pre-imperial times. Traditional Chinese musical instruments were traditionally grouped into eight categories known as bayin (\u516b\u97f3). Traditional Chinese opera is a form of musical theatre in China originating thousands of years and has regional style forms such as Beijing opera and Cantonese opera.[626] Chinese pop (C-Pop) includes mandopop and cantopop. Chinese rap, Chinese hip hop and Hong Kong hip hop have become popular in contemporary times.[627]\nCinema was first introduced to China in 1896 and the first Chinese film, Dingjun Mountain, was released in 1905.[628] China has the largest number of movie screens in the world since 2016,[629] China became the largest cinema market in the world in 2020.[630][631] The top 3 highest-grossing films in China currently are Wolf Warrior 2 (2017), Ne Zha (2019), and The Wandering Earth (2019).[632]\nHanfu is the historical clothing of the Han people in China. The qipao or cheongsam is a popular Chinese female dress.[633] The hanfu movement has been popular in contemporary times and seeks to revitalize Hanfu clothing.[634]\nChina has one of the oldest sporting cultures in the world. There is evidence that archery (sh\u00e8ji\u00e0n) was practiced during the Western Zhou dynasty. Swordplay (ji\u00e0nsh\u00f9) and cuju, a sport loosely related to association football[635] date back to China's early dynasties as well.[636]\nPhysical fitness is widely emphasized in Chinese culture, with morning exercises such as qigong and t'ai chi ch'uan widely practiced,[637] and commercial gyms and private fitness clubs are gaining popularity across the country.[638] Basketball is currently the most popular spectator sport in China.[639] The Chinese Basketball Association and the American National Basketball Association have a huge following among the people, with native or ethnic Chinese players such as Yao Ming and Yi Jianlian held in high esteem.[640] China's professional football league, now known as Chinese Super League, was established in 1994, it is the largest football market in East Asia.[641] Other popular sports in the country include martial arts, table tennis, badminton, swimming and snooker. Board games such as go (known as w\u00e9iq\u00ed in Chinese), xiangqi, mahjong, and more recently chess, are also played at a professional level.[642] In addition, China is home to a huge number of cyclists, with an estimated 470 million bicycles as of 2012[update].[459] Many more traditional sports, such as dragon boat racing, Mongolian-style wrestling and horse racing are also popular.[643]\nChina has participated in the Olympic Games since 1932, although it has only participated as the PRC since 1952. China hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, where its athletes received 48 gold medals \u2013 the highest number of gold medals of any participating nation that year.[644] China also won the most medals of any nation at the 2012 Summer Paralympics, with 231 overall, including 95 gold medals.[645][646] In 2011, Shenzhen in Guangdong, China hosted the 2011 Summer Universiade. China hosted the 2013 East Asian Games in Tianjin and the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics in Nanjing; the first country to host both regular and Youth Olympics. Beijing and its nearby city Zhangjiakou of Hebei province collaboratively hosted the 2022 Olympic Winter Games, making Beijing the first dual olympic city in the world by holding both the Summer Olympics and the Winter Olympics.[647][648]\nNotably, the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica specifies the United States' area (excluding coastal and territorial waters) as 9,525,067 km2, which is less than either source's figure given for China's area.[15] Therefore, while it can be determined that China has a larger area excluding coastal and territorial waters, it is unclear which country has a larger area including coastal and territorial waters.\nThe United Nations Statistics Division's figure for the United States is 9,833,517\u00a0km2 (3,796,742\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and China is 9,596,961\u00a0km2 (3,705,407\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). These closely match the CIA World Factbook figures and similarly include coastal and territorial waters for the United States, but exclude coastal and territorial waters for China.\nFurther explanation of disputed ranking: The dispute about which is the world's third-largest country arose from the inclusion of coastal and territorial waters for the United States. This discrepancy was deduced from comparing the CIA World Factbook and its previous iterations[18] against the information for United States in Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, particularly its footnote section.[15] In sum, according to older versions of the CIA World Factbook (from 1982 to 1996), the U.S. was listed as the world's fourth-largest country (after Russia, Canada, and China) with a total area of 9,372,610\u00a0km2 (3,618,780\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). However, in the 1997 edition, the U.S. added coastal waters to its total area (increasing it to 9,629,091\u00a0km2 (3,717,813\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)). And then again in 2007, U.S. added territorial water to its total area (increasing it to 9,833,517\u00a0km2 (3,796,742\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)). During this time, China's total area remained unchanged. In other words, no coastal or territorial water area was added to China's total area figure. The United States has a coastal water area of 109,362\u00a0km2 (42,225\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), and a territorial water area of 195,213\u00a0km2 (75,372\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), for a total of 304,575\u00a0km2 (117,597\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of additional water space. This is larger than entire countries like Italy, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Adding this figure to the U.S. will boost it over China in ranking since China's coastal and territorial water figures are currently unknown (no official publication) and thus cannot be added into China's total area figure.\nWorld portal\nCoordinates: 35\u00b0N 103\u00b0E\ufeff / \ufeff35\u00b0N 103\u00b0E\ufeff / 35; 103", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "

Wikipedia": {"text": "The Three-child policy (Chinese: \u4e09\u5b69\u653f\u7b56; pinyin: S\u0101nh\u00e1i Zh\u00e8ngc\u00e8), whereby a couple can have three children, was a family planning policy in the People's Republic of China.[1][2] The policy was announced on 31 May 2021 at a meeting of the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), chaired by CCP General Secretary, Xi Jinping, on population aging.[3][4]\nThe announcement came after the release of the results of the Seventh National Population Census, which showed that the number of births in mainland China in 2020 was only 12 million, the lowest number of births since 1960, and the further aging of the population, against which the policy was born.[5] This was the slowest population growth rate China experienced.[6] The state-owned Chinese news agency, Xinhua, stated that this policy would be accompanied by supportive measures to maintain China's advantage in human labor.[3] However, some Chinese citizens expressed dissatisfaction with the policy, as they would be unable to raise children due to the high cost of living in China.[7][4]\nThe policy was adopted by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and State Council of the People's Republic of China in June 2021 and announced in July.[8] In August the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress amended the family planning law cancelling restrictive measures including fines for couples having more children than permitted.[9][10]\nBeginning in 1979, China implemented the one-child policy, which stipulated that a couple could only have one child, resulting in a declining new population and a rapidly aging society. In order to slow down the trend of population aging, in 2015, the CCP officially launched the two-child policy, which relaxed the birth restrictions. However, the policy did not result in the expected wave of births, and the pregnancy rate among young women continued to show a record low decline, experiencing a third consecutive year of decrease.[11] In this regard, during the 2020 National People's Congress (NPC) session, NPC deputy Huang Xihua suggested removing the penalty policy for having more than three children.[12] Previously, the fine, called a \"social upbringing fee\" or \"social maintenance fee\", was the punishment for the families having more than one child. According to the policy, the families violating the law brought the burden to the whole society. Therefore, the social maintenance fee was used for the operation of local governments. [13]\nA January 2022 study suggested allowing a third child would not significantly boost fertility in the short term.[14]\nIn January 2023, the government of Sichuan Province announced that it had abolished the three-child policy completely. Therefore, parents in Sichuan can now legally have as many children as they want. This was implemented to promote fertility in Sichuan.[15]", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-child_policy", " https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/china#bodyContent",

Wikipedia": {"text": "The economy of Mexico is a developing mixed-market economy.[21] It is the 14th largest in the world in nominal GDP terms and the 13th largest by purchasing power parity, according to the International Monetary Fund.[22] Since the 1994 crisis, administrations have improved the country's macroeconomic fundamentals. Mexico was not significantly influenced by the 2002 South American crisis, and maintained positive, although low, rates of growth after a brief period of stagnation in 2001. However, Mexico was one of the Latin American nations most affected by the 2008 recession with its gross domestic product contracting by more than 6% in that year.\nThe Mexican economy has had unprecedented macroeconomic stability, which has reduced inflation and interest rates to record lows. In spite of this, significant gaps persist between the urban and the rural population, the northern and southern states, and the rich and the poor.[23] Some of the unresolved issues include the upgrade of infrastructure, the modernization of the tax system and labor laws, and the reduction of income inequality. Tax revenues, altogether 19.6 percent of GDP in 2013, were the lowest among the then 34 OECD countries.[24] As of 2022, the OECD 38 has members.[25]\nThe economy contains rapidly developing modern industrial and service sectors, with increasing private ownership. Recent administrations have expanded competition in ports, railroads, telecommunications, electricity generation, natural gas distribution and airports, with the aim of upgrading infrastructure. As an export-oriented economy, more than 90% of Mexican trade is under free trade agreements (FTAs) with more than 40 countries, including the European Union, Japan, Israel, and much of Central and South America. The most influential FTA is the United States\u2013Mexico\u2013Canada Agreement (USMCA), which came into effect in 2020, and was signed in 2018 by the governments of the United States, Canada and Mexico. In 2006, trade with Mexico's two northern partners accounted for almost 90% of its exports and 55% of its imports.[26] Recently, Congress approved important tax, pension, and judicial reforms.[clarification needed] Reform to the oil industry is currently being debated. In 2016, Mexico had 16 companies in the Forbes Global 2000 list of the world's largest companies.[27]\nMexico's labor force consisted of 52.8 million people as of 2015.[28] The OECD and WTO both rank Mexican workers as the hardest-working in the world in terms of the number of hours worked yearly. Pay per hours worked remains low.[29][30][31][32][33]\nThe Porfiriato brought unprecedented economic growth during the last quarter of the nineteenth century.[34] This growth was accompanied by foreign investment and European immigration, the development of railroad networks and the exploitation of the country's natural resources. Annual economic growth between 1876 and 1910 averaged 3.3%.[35] Large-scale ownership made considerable progress while foreign land companies accumulated millions of hectares. At the end of Porfirio D\u00edaz's dictatorship, 97% of arable land belonged to 1% of the population and 95% of peasants were landless, becoming farmworkers in huge haciendas or forming an impoverished urban proletariat whose revolts were crushed one by one.[36]\nPolitical repression and fraud, as well as huge income inequalities exacerbated by the land distribution system based on latifundios, in which large haciendas were owned by a few but worked by millions of impoverished peasants living in precarious conditions, led to the Mexican Revolution (1910\u20131920), an armed conflict that drastically transformed Mexico's political, social, cultural, and economic structure during the twentieth century. The war itself left a harsh toll on the economy and population, which decreased over the 11-year period between 1910 and 1921.[37] The reconstruction of the country was to take place in the following decades.\nThe period from 1940 to 1970 has been dubbed by economic historians as the Mexican Miracle, a period of economic growth that followed the end of the Mexican Revolution and the resumption of capital accumulation during peacetime. During this period, Mexico adopted an import substitution industrialization (ISI) model, which protected and promoted the development of national industries. Mexico experienced an economic boom through which industries rapidly expanded their production.[38] Important changes in the economic structure included free land distribution to peasants under the concept of ejido, the nationalization of the oil and railroad companies, the introduction of social rights into the 1917 Constitution, the birth of large and influential labor unions, and the upgrading of infrastructure. While population doubled from 1940 to 1970, GDP increased sixfold during the same period.[39]\nGrowth while under the ISI model had reached its peak in the late 1960s. During the 1970s, the presidential administrations of Luis Echeverr\u00eda (1970\u201376) and Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Portillo (1976\u201382) tried to include social development in their policies, an effort that entailed increased public spending. With the discovery of vast oil fields during a period of oil price increases and low international interest rates, the government borrowed from international capital markets to invest in the state-owned oil company Pemex, which in turn seemed to provide a long-run income source to promote social welfare. This produced a remarkable growth in public expenditure,[38] and president L\u00f3pez Portillo announced that the time had come to \"manage prosperity\"[40] as Mexico multiplied its oil production to become the world's fourth-largest exporter.[41]\nIn the period of 1981\u20131982 the international panorama changed abruptly: oil prices plunged and interest rates rose. In 1982, L\u00f3pez Portillo, just before ending his administration, suspended payments of foreign debt, devalued the peso and nationalized the banking system, along with many other industries that were severely affected by the crisis, among them the steel industry. While import substitution had contributed to Mexican industrialization, by the 1980s protracted protection of Mexican companies had led to an uncompetitive industrial sector with low productivity gains.[38]\nPresident Miguel de la Madrid (1982\u201388) was the first of a series of presidents that implemented neoliberal policies. After the crisis of 1982, lenders were unwilling to return to Mexico and, in order to keep the current account in balance, the government resorted to currency devaluations, which sparked unprecedented inflation,[38] reaching an annual record of 139.7% in 1987.[45]\nOne of the first steps toward trade liberalization was Mexico's signature of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1986 under President de la Madrid. During the administration of Carlos Salinas de Gortari (1988\u201394) many state-owned companies were privatized. The telephone company Telmex, a government monopoly, became a private monopoly, sold to Carlos Slim.[46] Also not opened to private investors were the government oil company Pemex or the energy sector. Furthermore, the banking system that had been nationalized in the waning hours of the L\u00f3pez Portillo administration in 1982 were privatized, but with the exclusion of foreign banks.[46] Salinas pushed for Mexico's inclusion in the North American Free Trade Agreement, expanding it from a U.S.-Canada agreement. The expanded NAFTA was signed in 1992, after the signature of two additional supplements on environments and labor standards, it came into effect on January 1, 1994.[47]\nSalinas also introduced strict price controls and negotiated smaller minimum wage increments with the labor union movement under the aging Fidel Vel\u00e1zquez with the aim of curbing inflation.[46] While his strategy was successful in reducing inflation, growth averaged only 2.8 percent a year.[38] By fixing the exchange rate, the peso became rapidly overvalued while consumer spending increased, causing the current account deficit to reach 7% of GDP in 1994. The deficit was financed through tesobonos a type of public debt instrument that reassured payment in dollars.[48]\nThe January 1994 Chiapas uprising, and the assassinations of the ruling party's presidential candidate in March 1994, Luis Donaldo Colosio and the Secretary-General of the party and brother of the Assistant-Attorney General Jos\u00e9 Francisco Ruiz Massieu in 1994, reduced investor confidence. Public debt holders rapidly sold their tesobonos, depleting the Central Bank's reserves,[48] while portfolio investments, which had made up 90% of total investment flows, left the country as fast as they had come in.[38]\nThis unsustainable situation eventually forced the entrant Zedillo administration to adopt a floating exchange rate. The peso sharply devalued and the country entered into an economic crisis in December 1994.[49] The boom in exports, as well as an international rescue package crafted by U.S. president Bill Clinton (1993-2001), helped cushion the crisis. In less than 18 months, the economy was growing again, and annual rate growth averaged 5.1 percent between 1995 and 2000.[38] More critical interpretations argue that the crisis and subsequent public bailout \"preserved, renewed, and intensified the structurally unequal social relations of power and class characteristic of finance-led neoliberal capitalism\" in forms institutionally specific to Mexican society, with GDP growth spurred by one-time privatizations.[49] Per capita economic growth in the 2000s was low.[37]\nPresident Ernesto Zedillo (1994\u20132000), and President Vicente Fox (2000\u201306), of the National Action Party (Mexico), the first opposition party candidate to win a presidential election since the founding of the precursor of the Institutional Revolutionary Party in 1929, continued with trade liberalization. During Fox's administrations, several FTAs were signed with Latin American and European countries, Japan and Israel, and both strove to maintain macroeconomic stability. Thus, Mexico became one of the most open countries in the world to trade, and the economic base shifted accordingly. Total trade with the United States and Canada tripled, and total exports and imports almost quadrupled between 1991 and 2003.[50] The nature of foreign investment also changed with a greater share of foreign-direct investment (FDI) over portfolio investment.\nMexico's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in purchasing power parity (PPP) was estimated at US$2,143.499 billion in 2014, and $1,261.642 billion in nominal exchange rates.[42] It is the leader of the MINT group. Its standard of living, as measured in GDP in PPP per capita, was US$16,900. The World Bank reported in 2009 that Mexico's Gross National Income in market exchange rates was the second highest in Latin America, after Brazil at US$1,830.392\u00a0billion,[51] which lead to the highest income per capita in the region at $14,400.[52] As such, Mexico established itself as an upper middle-income country. After the slowdown of 2001 the country has recovered and has grown 4.2, 3.0 and 4.8 percent in 2004, 2005 and 2006,[53] even though it is considered to be well below Mexico's potential growth.[48]\nThe Mexican peso is the currency (ISO 4217: MXN; symbol: $). One peso is divided into 100 centavos (cents). MXN replaced MXP in 1993 at a rate of 1000 MXP per 1 MXN. The exchanged rate remained stable between 1998 and 2006, oscillating between 10.20 and 11=3.50 MXN per US$. The Mexican peso parity decreased under president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, lost in a single year 19.87% of its value Archived March 29, 2017, at the Wayback Machine reaching an exchange rate of $20.37 per dollar in 2017. Interest rates in 2007 were situated at around 7 percent,[54] having reached a historic low in 2002 below 5 percent. Inflation rates are also at historic lows; the inflation rate in Mexico in 2006 was 4.1 percent, and 3 percent by the end of 2007. Compared against the US Dollar, Mexican Peso has devalued over %7,500 since 1910.[citation needed]\nUnemployment rates are the lowest of all OECD member countries at 3.2 percent. However, underemployment is estimated at 25 percent.[26] Mexico's Human Development Index was reported at 0.829 in 2008,[55] (comprising a life expectancy index of 0.84, an education index of 0.86 and a GDP index of 0.77), ranking 52 in the world within the group of high-development.\nDevelopment\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980\u20132021(with IMF staff stimtates in 2022-2027). Inflation below 5% is in green.[56]\n(in Bil. US$PPP)\n(in US$ PPP)\n(in Bil. US$nominal)\n(in US$ nominal)\n(real)\n(in Percent)\n(in Percent)\n(in\u00a0% of GDP)\nPoverty in Mexico is measured under parameters such as nutrition, clean water, shelter, education, health care, social security, quality and basic services in the household, income and social cohesion as defined by social development laws in the country.[57] It is divided in two categories: Moderate poverty and Extreme poverty.\nWhile less than 2% of Mexico's population lives below the international poverty line set by the World Bank, as of 2013, Mexico's government estimates that 33% of Mexico's population lives in moderate poverty and 9% lives in extreme poverty,[58] which leads to 42% of Mexico's total population living below the national poverty line.[59] The gap might be explained by the government's adopting the multidimensional poverty method as a way to measure poverty, so a person who has an income higher than the \"international poverty line\" or \"well being income line\" set by the Mexican government might fall in the \"moderate poverty\" category if he or she has one or more deficiencies related to social rights such as education (did not complete studies), nutrition (malnutrition or obesity), or living standards (including elemental, such as water or electricity, and secondary domestic assets, such as refrigerators). Extreme poverty is defined by the Mexican government as persons who have deficiencies in both social rights and an income lower than the \"well being income line\".[60] Additional figures from SEDESOL (Mexico's social development agency) estimates that 6% (7.4 million people) live in extreme poverty and suffer from food insecurity.[61]\nRecently, extensive changes in government economic policy[62] and attempts at reducing government interference through privatization of several sectors,[63] for better[64] or worse,[65] allowed Mexico to remain the biggest economy in Latin America,[66][dubious  \u2013 discuss] until 2005 when it became the second-largest;[67] and a so-called \"trillion dollar club\" member.[68] Despite these changes, Mexico continues to suffer great social inequality and lack of opportunities.[69] The Pe\u00f1a Nieto's administration made an attempt at reducing poverty in the country, to provide more opportunities to its citizens such as jobs,[70] education, and the installation of universal healthcare.[71][72]\nA single person in Mexico, Carlos Slim,[73] has a net worth equal to six percent of GDP. Additionally, only ten percent of Mexicans represent 25% of Mexican GDP. A smaller group, 3.5%, represent 12.5% of Mexican GDP.[74]\nAccording to the OECD, Mexico is the country with the second highest degree of economic disparity between the extremely poor and extremely rich, after Chile \u2013 although this gap has been diminishing over the last decade. The bottom ten percent on the income rung disposes of 1.36% of the country's resources, whereas the upper 10% dispose of almost 36%. OECD also notes that Mexico's budgeted expenses for poverty alleviation and social development is only about a third of the OECD average \u2013 both in absolute and relative numbers.[75] According to the World Bank, in 2004, 17.6% of Mexico's population lived in extreme poverty, while 21% lived in moderated poverty.[76]\nMexico was the fourth largest receiver of remittances in the world in 2017. Remittances, or contributions sent by Mexicans living abroad, mostly in the United States, to their families at home in Mexico comprised $28.5\u00a0billion in 2017.[77] In 2015, remittances overtook oil to become the single largest foreign source of income for Mexico, larger than any other sector.[78]\nThe growth of remittances have more than doubled since 1997.[79] Recorded remittance transactions exceeded 41 million in 2003, of which 86 percent were made by electronic transfer.[80]\nThe Mexican government, cognizant of the needs of migrant workers, began issuing an upgraded version of the Matr\u00edcula Consular de Alta Seguridad (MACS, High Security Consular Identification), an identity document issued at Mexican consulates abroad. This document is now accepted as a valid identity card in 32 US states, as well as thousands of police agencies, hundreds of cities and counties, as well as banking institutions.[80]\nThe main states receiving remittances in 2014 were Michoac\u00e1n, Guanajuato, Jalisco, the State of Mexico and Puebla, which jointly captured 45% of total remittances in that year.[81] Several state governments, with the support of the federal government, have implemented programs to use part of the remittances to finance public works. This program, called Dos por Uno (Two for every one) is designed in a way that for each peso contributed by migrants from their remittances, the state and the federal governments will invest two pesos in building infrastructure at their home communities.[82]\nRegional disparities and income inequality are a feature of the Mexican economy. While all constituent states of the federation have a Human Development Index (HDI) higher than 0.70 (medium to high development), the northern and central states have higher levels of HDI than the southern states. Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Jalisco and the Federal District have HDI levels similar to European countries, whereas that of Oaxaca and Chiapas is similar to that of China or Vietnam.[83]\nAt the municipal level, economic disparities are even greater: Benito Ju\u00e1rez borough in Mexico City has an HDI similar to that of Germany or New Zealand, whereas, Metlat\u00f3noc in Guerrero, would have an HDI similar to that of Malawi. The majority of the federal entities in the north have a high development (higher than 0.80), as well as the entities Colima, Jalisco, Aguascalientes, the Federal District, Quer\u00e9taro and the southeastern states of Quintana Roo and Campeche). The less developed states (with medium development in terms of HDI, higher than 0.70) are located along the southern Pacific coast.\nIn terms of share of the GDP by economic sector (in 2004), the largest contributors in agriculture are Jalisco (9.7%), Sinaloa (7.7%) and Veracruz (7.6%); the greatest contributors in industrial production are the Federal District (15.8%), State of M\u00e9xico (11.8%) and Nuevo Le\u00f3n (7.9%); the greatest contributors in the service sector are also the Federal District (25.3%), State of M\u00e9xico (8.9%) and Nuevo Le\u00f3n (7.5%).[84]\nSince the 1980s, the economy has slowly become less centralized; the annual rate of GDP growth of the Federal District from 2003 to 2004 was the smallest of all federal entities at 0.2%, with drastic drops in the agriculture and industrial sectors. Nonetheless, it still accounts for 21.8% of the nation's GDP. The states with the highest GDP growth rates are Quintana Roo (9.0%), Baja California (8.9%), and San Luis Potos\u00ed (8.2%).[85] In 2000, the federal entities with the highest GDP per capita in Mexico were the Federal District (US$26,320), Campeche (US$18,900) and Nuevo Le\u00f3n (US$30,250); the states with the lowest GDP per capita were Chiapas (US$3,302), Oaxaca (US$4,100) and Guerrero (US$6,800).[86]\nGross Domestic Product (GDP) in purchasing power parity (PPP) in 2022 was estimated at US$2,89\u00a0trillion, and GDP per capita in PPP at US$22,216.[22] The service sector is the largest component of GDP at 70.5%, followed by the industrial sector at 25.7% (2006 est.). Agriculture represents only 3.9% of GDP (2006 est.). Mexican labor force is estimated at 38 million of which 18% is occupied in agriculture, 24% in the industry sector and 58% in the service sector (2003 est.). Mexico's largest source of foreign income is remittances.[87]\nAgriculture as a percentage of total GDP has been steadily declining, and now resembles that of developed nations in that it plays a smaller role in the economy. In 2006, agriculture accounted for 3.9% of GDP,[26] down from 7% in 1990,[88] and 25% in 1970.[89] Given the historic structure of ejidos, it employs a considerably high percentage of the work force: 18% in 2003,[26] mostly of which grows basic crops for subsistence, compared to 2\u20135% in developed nations in which production is highly mechanized.\nAfter the Mexican Revolution Mexico began an agrarian reform, based on the 27th article of the Mexican Constitution than included transfer of land and/or free land distribution to peasants and small farmers under the concept of the ejido.[91] This program was further extended during President C\u00e1rdenas' administration during the 1930s[92] and continued into the 1960s at varying rates.[93] The cooperative agrarian reform, which guaranteed small farmers a means of subsistence livelihood, also caused land fragmentation and lack of capital investment, since commonly held land could not be used as collateral. In an effort to raise rural productivity and living standards, this constitutional article was amended in 1992 to allow for the transfer of property rights of the communal lands to farmers cultivating it.[94] With the ability to rent or sell it, a way was open for the creation of larger farms and the advantages of economies of scale. Large mechanized farms are now operating in some northwestern states (mainly in Sinaloa). However, privatization of ejidos continues to be very slow in the central and southern states where the great majority of peasants produce only for subsistence.[citation needed]\nUntil the 1980s, the government encouraged the production of basic crops (mainly corn and beans) by maintaining support prices and controlling imports through the National Company for Popular Subsistence (CONASUPO). With trade liberalization, however, CONASUPO was gradually dismantled and two new mechanisms were implemented: Alianza and Procampo. Alianza provides income payments and incentives for mechanization and advanced irrigation systems. Procampo is an income transfer subsidy to farmers. This support program provides 3.5\u00a0million farmers who produce basic commodities (mostly corn), and which represent 64% of all farmers, with a fixed income transfer payment per unit of area of cropland. This subsidy increased substantially during president Fox's administration, mainly to white corn producers in order to reduce imports from the United States. This program has been successful, and in 2004, roughly only 15% of corn imports are white corn \u2013the one used for human consumption and the type that is mostly grown in Mexico\u2013 as opposed to 85% of yellow and crashed corn \u2013the one use for feeding livestock, and which is barely produced in Mexico.[95]\nIn spite of being a staple in the Mexican diet, Mexico's comparative advantage in agriculture is not in corn, but in horticulture, tropical fruits, and vegetables. Negotiators of NAFTA expected that through liberalization and mechanization of agriculture two-thirds of Mexican corn producers would naturally shift from corn production to horticultural and other labor-intensive crops such as fruits, nuts, vegetables, coffee and sugar cane.[96] While horticultural trade has drastically increased due to NAFTA, it has not absorbed displaced workers from corn production (estimated at around 600,000).[95] Corn production has remained stable (at 20 million metric tons), arguably, as a result of income support to farmers, or a reluctance to abandon a millenarian tradition in Mexico: not only have peasants grown corn for millennia, corn originated in Mexico. Mexico is the seventh largest corn producer in the world.[90]\nThe area dedicated to potatoes has changed little since 1980 and average yields have almost tripled since 1961. Production reached a record 1.7\u00a0million tonnes in 2003. Per capita consumption of potato in Mexico stands at 17\u00a0kg a year, very low compared to its maize intake of 400\u00a0kg.[97] On average, potato farms in Mexico are larger than those devoted to more basic food crops. Potato production in Mexico is mostly for commercial purposes; the production for household consumption is very small.[98]\nMexico is by far the world's largest avocado growing country, producing several times more than the second largest producer. In 2013, the total area dedicated to avocado production was 188,723 hectares (415,520 acres), and the harvest was 2.03 million tonnes in 2017. The states that produce the most are M\u00e9xico, Morelos, Nayarit, Puebla, and Michoacan, accounting for 86% of the total.[citation needed]\nApproximately 160,000 medium-sized farmers grow sugar cane in 15 Mexican states; currently there are 54 sugar mills around the country that produced 4.96\u00a0million tons of sugar in the 2010 crop, compared to 5.8\u00a0million tons in 2001.[99] Mexico's sugar industry is characterized by high production costs and lack of investment. Mexico produces more sugar than it consumes.[100] Sugar cane is grown on 700,000 farms in Mexico with a yield of 72 metric tons per farm.[101]\nIn 2019, the country was the world's largest producer of silver[102] 9th largest producer of gold,[103] the 8th largest producer of copper,[104] the world's 5th largest producer of lead,[105] the world's 6th largest producer of zinc,[106] the world's 5th largest producer of molybdenum,[107] the world's 3rd largest producer of mercury,[108] the world's 5th largest producer of bismuth,[109] the world's 13th largest producer of manganese[110] and the 23rd largest world producer of phosphate.[111] It is also the 8th largest world producer of salt.[112]\nIn April 2022, the Senate passed a law that nationalizes the lithium mining industry in the country. The federal government will have a monopoly on all new lithium mines in the country, but existing operations will be allowed to continue in private hands.[113] Critics of the move argue that the constitution already does this[113] and that the government lacks the technical capacity to mine the major reserves, which are mostly in clay deposits that are difficult to mine. The government made a similar failed attempt to nationalize uranium mining in the 1980s.[114]\nThe industrial sector as a whole has benefited from trade liberalization; in 2000 it accounted for almost 50% of all export earnings.[50]\nAmong the most important industrial manufacturers in Mexico is the automotive industry, whose standards of quality are internationally recognized. The automobile sector in Mexico differs from that in other Latin American countries and developing nations in that it does not function as a mere assembly manufacturer. The industry produces technologically complex components and engages in some research and development activities, an example of that is the new Volkswagen Jetta model with up to 70% of parts designed in Mexico.[50][115]\nThe \"Big Three\" (General Motors, Ford and Chrysler) have been operating in Mexico since the 1930s, while Volkswagen and Nissan built their plants in the 1960s.[116] Later, Toyota, Honda, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz have also participated. Given the high requirements of North American components in the industry, many European and Asian parts suppliers have also moved to Mexico: in Puebla alone, 70 industrial part-makers cluster around Volkswagen.[50]\nThe relatively small domestic car industry is represented by DINA Camiones, a manufacturer of trucks, busses and military vehicles, which through domestic production and purchases of foreign bus manufacturers has become the largest bus manufacturer in the world; Vehizero that builds hybrid trucks[117] and the new car companies Mastretta design that builds the Mastretta MXT sports car and Autobuses King that plans to build 10000 microbuses by 2015,[118][119][120] nevertheless new car companies are emerging among them CIMEX that has developed a sport utility truck, the Conin, and it is to be released in September 2010 in Mexico's national auto show,[121] And the new electric car maker Grupo Electrico Motorizado.[122] Some large industries of Mexico include Cemex, the world's largest construction company and the third largest cement producer[123] the alcohol beverage industries, including world-renowned players like Grupo Modelo; conglomerates like FEMSA, which apart from being the largest single producer of alcoholic beverages and owning multiple commercial interests such OXXO convenience store chain, is also the second-largest Coca-Cola bottler in the world; Gruma, the largest producer of corn flour and tortillas in the world; and Grupo Bimbo, Telmex, Televisa, among many others. In 2005, according to the World Bank, high-tech industrial production represented 19.6% of total exports.[124]\nMaquiladoras (manufacturing plants that take in imported raw materials and produce goods for domestic consumption and export on behalf of foreign companies) have become the landmark of trade in Mexico. This sector has benefited from NAFTA, in that real income in the maquiladora sector has increased 15.5% since 1994, though from the non-maquiladora sector has grown much faster.[48] Contrary to popular belief, this should be no surprise since maquiladora's products could enter the US duty-free since a 1960s industry agreement. Other sectors now benefit from the free trade agreement, and the share of exports from non-border states has increased in the last 5 years while the share of exports from maquiladora-border states has decreased.\nCurrently Mexico is focusing in developing an aerospace industry and the assembly of helicopter and regional jet aircraft fuselages is taking place. Foreign firms such as MD Helicopters,[125] Bell,[126] Cessna[127] and Bombardier[128] build helicopter, aircraft and regional jets fuselages in Mexico. Although the Mexican aircraft industry is mostly foreign, as is its car industry, Mexican firms have been founded such as Aeromarmi,[129] which builds light propeller airplanes, and Hydra Technologies, which builds Unmanned Aerial Vehicles such as the S4 Eh\u00e9catl, other important companies are Frisa Aerospace that manufactures jet engine parts for the new Mitsubishi Regional jet and supplies Prat&whittney and Rolls-Royce jet engine manufacturers of casings for jet engines[130][131][132] and Kuo Aerospace that builds parts for aircraft landing gear and Supplies bombardier plant in Quer\u00e9taro.[133]\nAs compared with the United States or countries in Western Europe a larger sector of Mexico's industrial economy is food manufacturing which includes several world class companies but the regional industry is undeveloped. There are national brands that have become international and local Mom and Pop producers but little manufacturing in between.[citation needed]\nThe electronics industry of Mexico has grown enormously within the last decade. Mexico has the sixth largest electronics industry in the world after China, United States, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Mexico is the second largest exporter of electronics to the United States where it exported $71.4 billion worth of electronics in 2011.[134] The Mexican electronics industry is dominated by the manufacture and OEM design of televisions, displays, computers, mobile phones, circuit boards, semiconductors, electronic appliances, communications equipment and LCD modules. The Mexican electronics industry grew 20% between 2010 and 2011, up from its constant growth rate of 17% between 2003 and 2009.[134] Currently electronics represent 30% of Mexico's exports.[134]\nThe design and manufacture of flat panel plasma, LCD and LED televisions is the single largest sector of the Mexican electronics industry, representing 25% of Mexico's electronics export revenue.[134] In 2009 Mexico surpassed South Korea and China as the largest manufacturer of televisions,[135][136] with Sony,[137] Toshiba,[138] Samsung,[139] Sharp (through Semex),[140][141] Zenith[142] LG,[143] Lanix,[144] TCL,[145] RCA,[146] Phillips,[147] Elcoteq,[148] Tatung,[149] Panasonic,[150] and Vizio[140][151] manufacturing CRT, LCD, LED and Plasma televisions in Mexico. Due to Mexico's position as the largest manufacturer of television it is known as the television capital of the world[140] in the electronics industry.\nMexico is the third largest manufacturers of computers in the world with both domestic companies such as Lanix,[152] Texa,[153] Meebox,[154] Spaceit,[155] Kyoto[156] and foreign companies such as Dell,[157][158] Sony, HP,[159] Acer[160] Compaq,[161] Samsung and Lenovo[162][163] manufacturing various types of computers across the country. Most of the computers manufactured in Mexico are from foreign companies. Mexico is Latin America's largest producer of electronics and appliances made by domestic companies.\nMexico is also home to a large number of OEM and ODM manufactures both foreign and domestic. Among them include Foxconn,[164] Celestica, Sanmina-SCI,[165][166] Jabil,[167] Elcoteq,[168][169] Falco,[170] Kimball International, Compal,[171] Benchmark Electronics,[172] Plexus, Lanix[173] and Flextronics.[174][175] These companies assemble finished electronics or design and manufacture electronic components on behalf of larger companies such as Sony or Microsoft using locally sourced components, for example the ODM, Flextronics manufactures Xbox video games systems in Guadalajara, Mexico[176][177] for Microsoft using components such as power systems and printed circuit boards from a local company, Falco Electronics which acts as the OEM.\nThe success and rapid growth of the Mexican electronics sector is driven primarily by the relatively low cost of manufacturing and design in Mexico; its strategic position as a major consumer electronics market coupled with its proximity to both the large North American and South American markets whom Mexico shares free trade agreements with; government support in the form of low business taxes, simplified access to loans and capital for both foreign multinational and domestic startup tech-based firms; and a very large pool of highly skilled, educated labor across all sectors of the tech industry. For example, German multinational engineering and electronics conglomerate Siemens has a significant Mexican base, which also serves as its business and strategy hub for Central American countries and the Caribbean region.[178]\nThere are almost half a million (451,000) students enrolled in electronics engineering programs[180] with an additional 114,000 electronics engineers entering the Mexican workforce each year[134] and Mexico had over half a million (580,000) certified electronic engineering professionals employed in 2007.[136] From the late 1990s, the Mexican electronics industry began to shift away from simple line assembly to more advanced work such as research, design, and the manufacture of advanced electronics systems such as LCD panels, semiconductors, printed circuit boards, microelectronics, microprocessors, chipsets and heavy electronic industrial equipment and in 2006 the number of certified engineers being graduated annually in Mexico surpassed that of the United States.[181] Many Korean, Japanese and American appliances sold in the US are actually of Mexican design and origin but sold under the OEM's client names.[182][183] In 2008 one out of every four consumer appliances sold in the United States was of Mexican design.[184]\nWhile many foreign companies like Phillips, Vizio and LG simply install wholly owned factories in Mexico; a number of foreign companies have set up semi-independent joint venture companies with Mexican businesses to manufacture and design components in Mexico. These companies are independently operated from their foreign parent companies and are registered in Mexico. These local companies function under Mexican law and retain a sizable portion of the revenue. These companies typically function dually as in-company OEM development and design facilities and manufacturing centers and usually produce most components needed to manufacture the finished products. An example would by Sharp which has formed Semex.[185]\nSemex was founded as a joint venture between Sharp and Mexican investors which acts as an autonomous independent company which Sharp only maintains partial control over. The company manufactures whole products such televisions and designs individual components on behalf of Sharp such as LCD modules and in return Semex is granted access to Sharp capital, technology, research capacity and branding. Notable foreign companies which have set up joint venture entities in Mexico include Samsung which formed Samex,[186] a local designer and manufacturer of finished televisions, white goods and individual electronic components like printed circuit boards, LCD panels and semiconductors,[187] Toshiba, who formed Toshiba de M\u00e9xico, S.A. de C.V., an administratively autonomous subsidiary which produces electronics parts, televisions and heavy industrial equipment.[188]\nSome of these subsidiaries have grown to expand into multiple branches effectively becoming autonomous conglomerates within their own parent companies. Sony for example started operations in Mexico in 1976 with a group of Mexican investors, and founded the joint venture, Sony de Mexico[189] which produces LED panels, LCD modules, automotive electronics, appliances and printed circuit boards amongst other products for its Japanese parent company, Sony KG. Sony de Mexico has research facilities in Monterrey and Mexico City, designs many of the Sony products manufactured in Mexico and has now expanded to create its own finance, music and entertainment subsidiaries which are Mexican registered and independent of their Japanese parent corporation.[190]\nAlthough much of Mexico's electronics industry is driven by foreign companies, Mexico also has a sizeable domestic electronics industry and a number of electronics companies including Mabe, a major appliance manufacturer and OEM which has been functioning since the nineteen fifties and has expanded into the global market, Meebox, a designer and manufacturer desktop and tablet computers, solar power panels and electronics components, Texa, which manufactures computers laptops and servers, Falco, a major international manufacturer of electronic components such as printed circuitboards, power systems, semiconductors, gate drives and which has production facilities in Mexico, India and China, and Lanix, Mexico's largest electronics company which manufactures products such as computers, laptops, smartphones, LED and LCDs, flash memory, tablets, servers, hard drives, RAM, optical disk drives, and printed circuitboards and employs over 11,000 people in Mexico and Chile and distributes its products throughout Latin America.[191][192][193] Another area being currently developed in Mexico is Robotics, Mexico's new Mexone robot has been designed with the idea that in future years develop a commercial application for such advanced robots[194]\nMineral resources are public property by constitution. As such, the energy sector is administered by the government with varying degrees of private investment. Mexico is the fourteenth-largest oil producer in the world, with 1,710,303 barrels per day (271,916.4\u00a0m3/d).[195] Pemex, the state-owned company in charge of administering research, exploration and sales of oil, is the largest company in Mexico, and the second largest in Latin America after Brazil's Petrobras.[196] Pemex is heavily taxed of almost 62 per cent of the company's sales, a significant source of revenue for the government.[38]\nWithout enough money to continue investing in finding new sources or upgrading infrastructure, and being protected constitutionally from private and foreign investment, some have predicted the company may face institutional collapse.[38] While the oil industry is still relevant for the government's budget, its importance in GDP and exports has steadily fallen since the 1980s.[197] In 1980 oil exports accounted for 61.6% of total exports; by 2000 it was only 7.3%.[50]\nMexico's installed electricity capacity in 2008 was 58 GW. Of the installed capacity, 75% is thermal, 19% hydro, 2% nuclear and 3% renewable other than hydro.[198] The general trend in thermal generation is a decline in petroleum-based fuels and a growth in natural gas and coal. Since Mexico is a net importer of natural gas, higher levels of natural gas consumption (i.e. for power generation) will likely depend upon higher imports from either the United States or via liquefied natural gas (LNG).[199]\nManufacturing in Mexico grew rapidly in the late 1960s with the end of the US farm labor agreement known as the bracero program. This sent many farm laborers back into the Northern border region with no source of income. As a result, the US and Mexican governments agreed to The Border Industrialization Program, which permitted US companies to assemble products in Mexico using raw materials and components from the US with reduced duties. The Border Industrialization Program became known popularly as The Maquiladora Program or shortened to The Maquila Program.\nOver the years, simple assembly operations in Mexico have evolved into complex manufacturing operations including televisions, automobiles, industrial and personal products. While inexpensive commodity manufacturing has flown to China, Mexico attracts U.S. manufacturers that need low-cost solutions near-by for higher value end products and just-in-time components.\nThe automotive sector accounts for 17.6% of Mexico's manufacturing sector. General Motors, Chrysler, Ford Motor Company, Nissan, Fiat, Renault, Honda, Toyota, and Volkswagen produce 2.8 million vehicles annually at 20 plants across the country, mostly in Puebla.[200] Mexico manufactures more automobiles of \nany North American nation.[201] The industry produces technologically complex components and engages in research and development.[50]\nThe \"Big Three\" (General Motors, Ford and Chrysler) have been operating in Mexico since the 1930s, while Volkswagen and Nissan built their plants in the 1960s.[116] In Puebla 70 industrial part-makers cluster around Volkswagen.[50] In the 2010s expansion of the sector was surging. In 2014 more than $10 billion in investment was committed in the first few months of the year. Kia Motors in August 2014 announced plans for a $1 billion factory in Nuevo Le\u00f3n. At the time Mercedes-Benz and Nissan were already building a $1.4 billion plant near Aguascalientes, while BMW was planning a $1-billion assembly plant in San Luis Potos\u00ed. Additionally, Audi began building a $1.3 billion factory at San Jos\u00e9 Chiapa near Puebla in 2013.[202]\nMexico has a MXN 4.027 trillion retail sector (2013, about US$300 billion at the 2013 exchange rate)[203] including an estimated US$12 billion (2015) in e-commerce.[204] The largest retailer is Walmart, while the largest Mexico-based retailers are Soriana super/hypermarkets, FEMSA incl. its OXXO convenience stores, Coppel (department store), Liverpool department stores, Chedraui super/hypermarkets, and Comercial Mexicana super/hypermarkets.[203]\nIn 2013 the tertiary sector was estimated to account for 59.8% of Mexico's GDP.[26] In 2011 services employed 61.9% of the working population.[26] This section includes transportation, commerce, warehousing, restaurant and hotels, arts and entertainment, health, education, financial and banking services, telecommunications as well as public administration and defense. Mexico's service sector is strong, and in 2001 replaced Brazil's as the largest service sector in Latin America in dollar terms.[205]\nTourism is one of the most important industries in Mexico. It is the fourth largest source of foreign exchange for the country.[80] Mexico is the eighth most visited country in the world (with over 20 million tourists a year).[206]\nAccording to the IMF the Mexican banking system is strong, in which private banks are profitable and well-capitalized.[207] The financial and banking sector is increasingly dominated by foreign companies or mergers of foreign and Mexican companies with the notable exception of Banorte. The acquisition of Banamex, one of the oldest surviving financial institutions in Mexico, by Citigroup was the largest US-Mexico corporate merger, at US$12.5\u00a0billion.[208] The largest financial institution in Mexico is Bancomer associated to the Spanish BBVA.[209]\nThe process of institution building in the financial sector in Mexico has evolved hand in hand with the efforts of financial liberalization and of inserting the economy more fully into world markets.[210] Over the recent years, there has been a wave of acquisitions by foreign institutions such as US-based Citigroup, Spain's BBVA and the UK's HSBC. Their presence, along with a better regulatory framework, has allowed Mexico's banking system to recover from the 1994\u201395 peso crisis. Lending to the public and private sector is increasing and so is activity in the areas of insurance, leasing and mortgages.[211] However, bank credit accounts for only 22% of GDP, which is significantly low compared to 70% in Chile.[212] Credit to the Agricultural sector has fallen 45.5% in six years (2001 to 2007), and now represents about 1% of total bank loans.[213] Other important institutions include savings and loans, credit unions (known as \"cajas populares\"),[214] government development banks, \u201cnon-bank banks\u201d, bonded warehouses, bonding companies and foreign-exchange firms.[215]\nA wave of acquisitions has left Mexico's financial sector in foreign hands. Their foreign-run affiliates compete with independent financial firms operating as commercial banks, brokerage and securities houses, insurance companies, retirement-fund administrators, mutual funds, and leasing companies.\nMexico has a single securities market, the Mexican Stock Exchange (Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, known as the Bolsa). The market has grown steadily, with its main indices increasing by more than 600% in the last decade. It is Latin America's second largest exchange, after Brazil's. The total value of the domestic market capitalization of the BMV was calculated at US$409 billion at the end of 2011, and raised to US$451 billion by the end of February this year.[216]\nThe Indice de Precios y Cotizaciones (IPC, the general equities index) is the benchmark stock index on the Bolsa. In 2005 the IPC surged 37.8%, to 17,802.71 from 12,917.88, backed by a stronger Mexican economy and lower interest rates. It continued its steep rise through the beginning of 2006, reaching 19,272.63 points at end-March 2006. The stockmarket also posted a record low vacancy rate, according to the central bank. Local stockmarket capitalisation totalled US$236bn at end-2005, up from US$170 bn at end-2004. As of March 2006 there were 135 listed companies, down from 153 a year earlier. Only a handful of the listed companies are foreign. Most are from Mexico City or Monterrey; companies from these two cities compose 67% of the total listed companies.\nThe IPC consists of a sample of 35 shares weighted according to their market capitalisation. The largest companies include America Telecom, the holding company that manages Latin America's largest mobile company, Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil; Telmex, Mexico's largest telephone company; Grupo Bimbo, world's biggest baker; and Wal-Mart de M\u00e9xico, a subsidiary of the US retail company. The makeup of the IPC is adjusted every six months, with selection aimed at including the most liquid shares in terms of value, volume and number of trades.\nMexico's stock market is closely linked to developments in the US. Thus, volatility in the New York and Nasdaq stock exchanges, as well as interest-rate changes and economic expectations in the US, can steer the performance of Mexican equities. This is both because of Mexico's economic dependence on the US and the high volume of trading in Mexican equities through American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). Currently, the decline in the value of the dollar is making non-US markets, including Mexico's, more attractive.\nDespite the recent gains, investors remain wary of making placements in second-tier initial public offerings (IPOs). Purchasers of new issues were disappointed after prices fell in numerous medium-sized companies that made offerings in 1996 and 1997. IPO activity in Mexico remains tepid and the market for second-tier IPOs is barely visible. There were three IPOs in 2005.[217]\nBanco de M\u00e9xico is Mexico's central bank, an internally autonomous public institution whose governor is appointed by the president and approved by the legislature to which it is fully responsible. Banco de M\u00e9xico's functions are outlined in the 28th article of the constitution and further expanded in the Monetary Law of the United Mexican States.[219] Banco de M\u00e9xico's main objective is to achieve stability in the purchasing power of the national currency. It is also the lender of last resort.\nMexico has a floating exchange rate regime.\nThe floating exchange originated with reforms initiated after the December 1994 peso crash which had followed an unsustainable adherence to a short band. Under the new system, Banco de M\u00e9xico now makes no commitment to the level of the peso exchange rate, although it does employ an automatic mechanism to accumulate foreign reserves. It also possesses tools aimed at smoothing out volatility. The Exchange Rate Commission sets policy; it is made up of six members\u2014three each from the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (Secretar\u00eda de Hacienda y Cr\u00e9dito Publico\u2014SHCP) and the central bank, with the SHCP holding the deciding vote.\nIn August 1996, Banco de M\u00e9xico initiated a mechanism to acquire foreign reserves when the peso is strong, without giving the market signals about a target range for the exchange rate. The resulting high levels of reserves, mostly from petroleum revenues, have helped to improve the terms and conditions on debt Mexico places on foreign markets. However, there is concern that the government relies too heavily on oil income in order to build a healthy base of reserves. According to the central bank, international reserves stood at US$75.8\u00a0billion in 2007.[220] In May 2003, Banco de M\u00e9xico launched a program that sells U.S. dollars via a monthly auction, with the goal of maintaining a stable, but moderate, level of reserves.\nFrom April 1, 1998, through April 1, 2008, the Peso traded around a range varying from $8.46 MXN per US$1.00 on April 21, 1998, to $11.69 MXN per US$1.00 on May 11, 2004, a 10-year peak depreciation of 38.18% between the two reference date extremes before recovering.\nAfter the onset of the US credit crisis that accelerated in October 2008, the Peso had an exchange rate during October 1, 2008, through April 1, 2009 fluctuating from lowest to highest between $10.96 MXN per US$1.00 on October 1, 2008, to $15.42 MXN per US$1.00 on March 9, 2009, a peak depreciation ytd of 28.92% during those six months between the two reference date extremes before recovering.\nFrom the $11.69 rate during 2004's low to the $15.42 rate during 2009's low, the peso depreciated 31.91% in that span covering the US recession coinciding Iraq War of 2003 and 2004 to the US & Global Credit Crisis of 2008.\nSome experts including analysts at Goldman Sachs who coined the term BRIC in reference to the growing economies of Brazil, Russia, India, and China for marketing purposes believe that Mexico is going to be the 5th or 6th biggest economy in the world by the year 2050, behind China, United States, India, Brazil, and possibly Russia.\nMexico's monetary policy was revised following the 1994\u201395 financial crisis, when officials decided that maintaining general price stability was the best way to contribute to the sustained growth of employment and economic activity. As a result, Banco de M\u00e9xico has as its primary objective maintaining stability in the purchasing power of the peso. It sets an inflation target, which requires it to establish corresponding quantitative targets for the growth of the monetary base and for the expansion of net domestic credit.\nThe central bank also monitors the evolution of several economic indicators, such as the exchange rate, differences between observed and projected inflation, the results of surveys on the public and specialists\u2019 inflation expectations, revisions on collective employment contracts, producer prices, and the balances of the current and capital accounts.\nA debate continues over whether Mexico should switch to a US-style interest rate-targeting system. Government officials in favor of a change say that the new system would give them more control over interest rates, which are becoming more important as consumer credit levels rise.[citation needed]\nUntil 2008[citation needed],[221] Mexico used a unique system, amongst the OECD countries,[211] to control inflation in a mechanism known as the corto (lit. \"shortage\") a mechanism that allowed the central bank to influence market interest rates by leaving the banking system short of its daily demand for money by a predetermined amount. If the central bank wanted to push interest rates higher, it increased the corto. If it wished to lower interest rates, it decreased the corto. In April 2004, the Central Bank began setting a referential overnight interest rate as its monetary policy.[citation needed]\nPetty corruption based on exercise of administrative discretion in matters of zoning and business permits is endemic in Mexico[222] adding about 10% to the cost of consumer goods and services.[223] An April 2012 article in The New York Times reporting payment of bribes to officials throughout Mexico in order to obtain construction permits, information, and other favors[224] resulted in investigations in both the United States and Mexico.[225][226]\nUsing relatively recent night light data and electricity consumption in comparison with Gross County Product, the informal sector of the local economy in Veracruz state is shown to have grown during the period of the Fox Administration though the regional government remained PRI. The assumption that the informal economy of Mexico is a constant 30% of total economic activity is not supported at the local level. The small amount of local spatial autocorrelation that was found suggests a few clusters of high and low literacy rates amongst municipios in Veracruz but not enough to warrant including an I-statistic as a regressor. Global spatial autocorrelation is found especially literacy at the macro-regional level which is an area for further research beyond this study.[227]\nImproved literacy bolsters both the informal and formal economies in Veracruz indicating policies designed to further literacy are vital for growing the regional economy. While indigenous people are relatively poor, little evidence was found that the informal economy is a higher percentage of total economic activity in a municipio with a high share of indigenous people. While the formal economy might have been expanding relative to the informal economy in 2000, by 2006 this process had been reversed with growing informality. While rural municipios have smaller economies, they are not different than urban municipios in the share of the economy that is informal. Programs in the past that might move economic activity from the informal to the formal sector have not succeeded, suggesting public finance issues such as tax evasion will continue to plague the state with low government revenues.[227]\nMexico is a trade-oriented economy, with imports and exports totaling a 78% share of the GDP in 2019.[228] It is an important trade power as measured by the value of merchandise traded, and the country with the greatest number of free trade agreements.[229] In 2020, Mexico was the world's eleventh largest merchandise exporter and thirteenth largest merchandise importer, representing 2.4% and 2.2% of world trade, respectively (and those rankings increased to 7th and 9th if the EU is considered a single trading entity).[230] From 1991 to 2005, Mexican trade increased fivefold.[231] Mexico is the biggest exporter and importer in Latin America; in 2020, Mexico alone exported US$417.7\u00a0billion, roughly equivalent to the sum of the exports of the next 5 largest exporters (Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Peru, and Colombia).[230]\nMexican trade is fully integrated with that of its North American partners: as of 2019[update], approximately 80% of Mexican exports and 50% of its imports were traded with the United States and Canada.[232] Nonetheless, NAFTA has not produced trade diversion.[48] While trade with the United States increased 183% from 1993 to 2002, and that with Canada 165%, other trade agreements have shown even more impressive results: trade with Chile increased 285%, with Costa Rica 528% and Honduras 420%.[50] Trade with the European Union increased 105% over the same time period.[50]\nMexico joined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1986, and today is an active and constructive participant of the World Trade Organization. Fox's administration promoted the establishment of a Free Trade Area of the Americas; Puebla served as temporary headquarters for the negotiations, and several other cities are now candidates for its permanent headquarters if the agreement is reached and implemented.\nMexico has signed 12 free trade agreements with 44 countries:\nMexico has shown interest in becoming an associate member of Mercosur.[233] The Mexican government has also started negotiations with South Korea, Singapore and Peru,[234] and also wishes to start negotiations with Australia for a trade agreement between the two countries.\nThe 1994 North American Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is by far the most important Trade Agreement Mexico has signed both in the magnitude of reciprocal trade with its partners as well as in its scope. Unlike the rest of the Free Trade Agreements that Mexico has signed, NAFTA is more comprehensive in its scope and was complemented by the North American Agreement for Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC) and the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation (NAALC). An updating of the 1994 NAFTA, the U.S., Mexico, Canada (USMCA) is pending in early 2020, awaiting the ratification by Canada; the U.S. and Mexico have ratified it.\nThe NAAEC agreement was a response to environmentalists' concerns that companies would relocate to Mexico or the United States would lower its standards if the three countries did not achieve a unanimous regulation on the environment. The NAAEC, in an aim to be more than a set of environmental regulations, established the North American Commission for Environmental Cooperation (NACEC), a mechanism for addressing trade and environmental issues, the North American Development Bank (NADBank) for assisting and financing investments in pollution reduction and the Border Environmental Cooperation Commission (BECC). The NADBank and the BECC have provided economic benefits to Mexico by financing 36 projects, mostly in the water sector. By complementing NAFTA with the NAAEC, it has been labeled the \"greenest\" trade agreement.[235]\nThe NAALC supplement to NAFTA aimed to create a foundation for cooperation among the three members for the resolution of labor problems, as well as to promote greater cooperation among trade unions and social organizations in all three countries, in order to fight for the improvement of labor conditions. Though most economists agree that it is difficult to assess the direct impact of the NAALC, it is agreed that there has been a convergence of labor standards in North America. Given its limitations, however, NAALC has not produced (and in fact was not intended to achieve) convergence in employment, productivity and salary trend in North America.[236]\nThe agreement fell short in liberalizing movement of people across the three countries. In a limited way, however, immigration of skilled Mexican and Canadian workers to the United States was permitted under the TN status. NAFTA allows for a wide list of professions, most of which require at least a bachelor's degree, for which a Mexican or a Canadian citizen can request TN status and temporarily immigrate to the United States. Unlike the visas available to other countries, TN status requires no sponsorship, but simply a job offer letter.\nThe overall benefits of NAFTA have been quantified by several economists, whose findings have been reported in several publications like the World Bank's Lessons from NAFTA for Latin America and the Caribbean,[236] NAFTA's Impact on North America,[237] and NAFTA revisited by the Institute for International Economics.[48] They assess that NAFTA has been positive for Mexico, whose poverty rates have fallen, and real income salaries have risen even after accounting for the 1994\u20131995 economic crisis. Nonetheless, they also state that it has not been enough, or fast enough, to produce an economic convergence nor to reduce the poverty rates substantially or to promote higher rates of growth. Beside this the textile industry gain hype with this agreement and the textile industry in Mexico gained open access to the American market, promoting exports to the United States. The value of Mexican cotton and apparel exports to the U.S. grew from $3\u00a0billion in 1995 to $8.4\u00a0billion in 2002, a record high of $9.4\u00a0billion in 2000. At the same time, the share of Mexico's cotton textile market the U.S. has increased from 8 percent in 1995 to 13 percent in 2002.[citation needed] Some have suggested that in order to fully benefit from the agreement Mexico should invest in education and promote innovation as well as in infrastructure and agriculture.[236]\nContrary to popular belief, the maquiladora program existed far before NAFTA, dating to 1965. A maquiladora manufacturer operates by importing raw materials into Mexico either tariff free (NAFTA) or at a reduced rate on a temporary basis (18 months) and then using Mexico's relatively less expensive labor costs to produce finished goods for export. Prior to NAFTA maquiladora companies importing raw materials from anywhere in the world were given preferential tariff rates by the Mexican government so long as the finished good was for export. The US, prior to NAFTA, allowed Maquiladora manufactured goods to be imported into the US with the tariff rate only being applied to the value of non US raw materials used to produce the good, thus reducing the tariff relative to other countries. NAFTA has eliminated all tariffs on goods between the two countries, but for the maquiladora industry significantly increased the tariff rates for goods sourced outside of NAFTA.[citation needed]\nGiven the overall size of trade between Mexico and the United States, there are remarkably few trade disputes, involving relatively small dollar amounts. These disputes are generally settled in WTO or NAFTA panels or through negotiations between the two countries. The most significant areas of friction involve trucking, sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, and a number of other agricultural products.[89]\nA 2008 research brief published by the World Bank[238] as part of its Trade Costs and Facilitation Project suggested that Mexico had the potential to substantially increase trade flows and economic growth through trade facilitation reform. The study examined the potential impacts of trade facilitation reforms in four areas: port efficiency, customs administration, information technology, and regulatory environment (including standards).\nThe study projected overall increments from domestic reforms to be on the order of $31.8\u00a0billion, equivalent to 22.4 percent of total Mexican manufacturing exports for 2000\u201303. On the imports side, the corresponding figures are $17.1\u00a0billion and 11.2 percent, respectively. Increases in exports, including textiles, would result primarily from improvements in port efficiency and the regulatory environment. Exports of transport equipment would be expected to increase by the greatest increment from improvements in port efficiency, whereas exports of food and machinery would largely be the result of improvements in the regulatory environment. On the imports side, Mexican improvements in port efficiency would appear to be the most important factor, although for imports of transport equipment, improvements in service sector infrastructure would also be of relative importance.[238]\nThe following table shows the largest trading partners for Mexico in 2021 by total trade value in billions of USD.[239]", "links":

GDP (nominal) per capita - Wikipedia": {"text": "The figures presented here do not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country's currency. Such fluctuations change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference to the standard of living of its population.\nGDP per capita is often considered an indicator of a country's standard of living;[1][2] however, this is inaccurate because GDP per capita is not a measure of personal income.\nComparisons of national income are also frequently made on the basis of purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. (See List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita.) PPP largely removes the exchange rate problem but not others; it does not reflect the value of economic output in international trade, and it also requires more estimation than GDP per capita. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are more narrowly spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.\nNon-sovereign entities (the world, continents, and some dependent territories) and states with limited international recognition (such as Kosovo, Palestine, and Taiwan) are included in the list in cases in which they appear in the sources. These economies are not ranked in the charts here, but are listed in sequence by GDP for comparison. In addition, non-sovereign entities are marked in italics.\nNote that several leading GDP-per-capita (nominal) jurisdictions may be considered tax havens, and their GDP data subject to material distortion by tax planning activities. Examples include Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Ireland, and Luxembourg.[3]\nAll data are in current United States dollars. Historical data can be found here.\nThe table initially ranks each country or territory with their latest available estimates, and can be reranked by either of the sources\nNotes:\nMany of the leading GDP-per-capita (nominal) jurisdictions are tax havens whose economic data is artificially inflated by tax-driven corporate accounting entries.\nFor instance, the Irish GDP data above is subject to material distortion by the tax planning activities of foreign multinationals in Ireland. To address this, in 2017 the Central Bank of Ireland created \"modified GNI\" (or GNI*) as a more appropriate statistic, and the OECD and IMF have adopted it for Ireland. 2015 Irish GDP is 143% of 2015 Irish GNI*.\nA stunning $12 trillion\u2014almost 40 percent of all foreign direct investment positions globally\u2014is completely artificial: it consists of financial investment passing through empty corporate shells with no real activity. These investments in empty corporate shells almost always pass through well-known tax havens. The eight major pass-through economies\u2014the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Hong Kong SAR, the British Virgin Islands, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Ireland, and Singapore\u2014host more than 85 percent of the world\u2019s investment in special purpose entities, which are often set up for tax reasons.\nFurther discussion on this topic can be found in the List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita article.", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita", " https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/china#bodyContent", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page",

particular demands of the pandemic, which has led to strong growth in the number of mobile, mobile broadband, and fixed broadband subscribers since 2020; the level of growth is expected to taper off from late 2022 as the demand for working and schooling from home subsides; the pandemic also encouraged the Federal government to increase its investment in broadband infrastructure; of particular note was the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of November 2021, which provided $65 billion to a range of programs aimed at delivering broadband to unserved areas, providing fiber-based broadband to upgrade existing service areas, and subsidizing the cost of services to low income households; alongside these fiscal efforts have been the several spectrum auctions undertaken during the last two years, which have greatly assisted the main licensees to improve the reach and quality of their offers based on LTE and 5G; some of this spectrum, auctioned during 2021, was only made available to licensees from February 2022; the widening availability of 5G from the main providers has resulted in a dramatic increase in mobile data traffic; in tandem with the focus on 5G, operators have closed down their GSM and CDMA networks, and have either closed down 3G networks (as AT&T did in January 2022), or plan to in coming months; given the size of the US broadband market, and the growing demand for data on both fixed and mobile networks, there is continuous pressure for operators to invest in fiber networks, and to push connectivity closer to consumers; in recent years the US has seen increased activity from regional players as well as the major telcos and cablecos; although there has been considerable investment in DOCSIS4.0, some of the cablecos are looking to ditch HFC in preference for fiber broadband; the process of migrating from copper (HFC and DSL) to fiber is ongoing, but given the scale of the work involved it will take some years; some operators have investment strategies in place through to 2025, which will see the vast majority of their fixed networks being entirely on fiber; service offerings of up to 2Gb/s are becoming more widely available as the process continues (2022)domestic: fixed-line just over 29 per 100 and mobile-cellular is 110 per 100 (2021)international: country code - 1; landing points for the Quintillion Subsea Cable Network,

18.9% officers; highest was Air Force with women comprising 21.1% of its total personnel); a small number of American women were involved in combat during the Revolutionary (1775-1783), Mexican (1846-1848), and Civil (1861-1865) Wars, but they had to disguise themselves as men and enlist under aliases; the first official US military organization for women was the US Army Nurse Corps, established in 1901; during World War I, the US Navy and Marine Corps allowed women to enlist; nearly 350,000 women served in the US military during World War II; the 1991 Gulf War was the first war where women served with men in integrated units within a war zone; in 2015, women were allowed to serve in direct combat rolesnote 3: non-citizens living permanently and legally in the US may join as enlisted personnel; must have permission to work in the US, a high school diploma, and speak, read, and write English fluently; minimum age of 17 with parental consent or 18 without; maximum age 29-39, depending on the service; under the US Nationality Act, honorable service in the military may qualify individuals to obtain expedited citizenship; under the Compact of Free Association, citizens of the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Palau, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands may volunteer; under the Jay Treaty, signed in 1794 between Great Britain and the US, and corresponding legislation, Native Americans/First Nations born in Canada are entitled to freely enter the US and join the US military\n5,000 Africa; 1,700 Australia; 250 Diego Garcia; 150 Canada; 650 Cuba (Guantanamo Bay); 290 Egypt (MFO); approximately 100,000 Europe (Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Greece, Italy, Kosovo, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Turkey, UK); 150

28,000 South Korea; 200 Singapore; 100 Thailand (2022)note: US military rotational policies affect deployment numbers; the US deploys ground and air units to select countries for 6-12 month rotational assignments on a continuous basis; in South Korea, for example, the US continuously rotates combat brigades (approximately 3,000 personnel) for 9 months at a time; contingencies also affect US troop deployments; in 2019-2020, the US deployed more than 15,000 additional military personnel to the Middle East for an extended period of time and has sent more than 30,000 reinforcements to Europe in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine; in addition, some overseas US naval bases, such as the headquarters of US Naval Forces Central Command (USNAVCENT) in Manama, Bahrain, are frequented by the crews of US ships on 6-9 month deployments; a US carrier strike group with an air wing and supporting ships typically includes over 6,000 personnel\nthe US is a member of NATO and was one of the original 12 countries to sign the North Atlantic Treaty (also known as the Washington Treaty) in 1949the US military has 11 regional- or functionally-based joint service \"combatant\" commands: Africa Command; Central Command, Cyber Command, European Command, Indo-Pacific Command, Northern Command, Southern Command, Space Command, Special Operations Command, Strategic Command, and Transportation CommandCongress officially created the US military in September 1789; the US Army was established in June 1775 as the Continental Army; after the declaration of independence in July 1776, the Continental Army and the militia in the service of Congress became known collectively as the Army of the United States; when Congress ordered the Continental Army to disband in 1784, it retained a small number of personnel that would form the nucleus of the 1st American Regiment for national service formed later that year; both the US Navy and the US Marines were also established in 1775, but the Navy fell into disuse after the Revolutionary War, and was reestablished by Congress in 1794; the first US military unit devoted exclusively to aviation began operations in 1913 as part of the US Army; the Army Air Corps (AAC) was the US military service dedicated to aerial warfare between 1926 and 1941; the AAC became the US Army Air Forces in 1941 and remained as a combat arm of the Army

q\u016b; lit. 'Chongqing Central District') is the central district and heart of Chongqing municipality. It is the capital of the municipality and is also the political, economical, and entertainment center of the city of Chongqing.[1] Located in the central portion of Yuzhong is the Jiefangbei CBD, a leading business and financial center of western China.[citation needed]\nSurrounded on three sides by water, Yuzhong is effectively a peninsula between the Jialing and Yangtze Rivers. Due to the limited space, its hilly nature, and the fact that it is the main central business district for Chongqing, Yuzhong contains some of the tallest skyscrapers in China and is the most densely populated district in the municipality.\nDuring the Second Sino-Japanese War, the relocated headquarters of the Nationalist Government were located in Yuzhong.\nYuzhong District is the economic center of Chongqing. In 2015, the region's GDP reached 95.8 billion Yuan, the per capita GDP reached 147,524 Yuan,[3] retail sales reached 141.6 billion Yuan.[citation needed] The number of commercial banks in the district and municipal financial institutions reached 18, including HSBC, Standard Chartered, and Bank of East Asia. The largest western China commercial area, Jiefangbei central business district,[4] has brought together 90 percent of the domestic financial institutions in Chongqing, as well as two-thirds of Chongqing\u2019s foreign banks and insurance agencies. Three-quarters of the world\u2019s top 500 enterprises in Chongqing and many foreign consular offices are also located here.\nChongqing Bashu Secondary School, once called Bashu Middle School (\u5df4\u8700\u4e2d\u5b66) is a secondary school located in the Huanghuayuan area.[5] Founded in 1933, it educates students aged 12\u201318. Its motto is \u516c\u6b63\u8bda\u6734 (Selflessness, Justice, Honesty and Simplicity).\nYuzhong is currently served by four metro lines operated by Chongqing Rail Transit:\nCoordinates: 29\u00b033\u203238\u2033N 106\u00b034\u203224\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff29.560454\u00b0N 106.573400\u00b0E\ufeff / 29.560454; 106.573400\nThis Chongqing location article is a stub.

Wikipedia": {"text": "Coordinates: 17\u00b020\u2032N 62\u00b045\u2032W\ufeff / \ufeff17.333\u00b0N 62.750\u00b0W\ufeff / 17.333; -62.750\nSaint Kitts and Nevis (/-\u02c8k\u026ats\u2009...\u2009\u02c8ni\u02d0v\u026as/ (listen)), officially the Federation of Saint Christopher and Nevis,[7] is an island country and microstate consisting of the two islands of Saint Kitts and Nevis, both located in the West Indies, in the Leeward Islands chain of the Lesser Antilles. With 261 square kilometres (101\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of territory, and roughly 50,000 inhabitants, it is the smallest sovereign state in the Western Hemisphere, in both area and population, as well as the world's smallest sovereign federation.[1] The country is a Commonwealth realm, with Charles III as King and head of state.[1][8] It is the only sovereign federation in the Caribbean.\nThe capital city is Basseterre, located on the larger island of Saint Kitts.[1] Basseterre is also the main port for passenger entry (via cruise ships) and cargo. The smaller island of Nevis lies approximately 3\u00a0km (2\u00a0mi) to the southeast of Saint Kitts, across a shallow channel called The Narrows.[1]\nThe British dependency of Anguilla was historically also a part of this union, which was known collectively as Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla. However, Anguilla chose to secede from the union, and remains a British overseas territory.[1] The islands of Sint Eustatius, Saba, Saint Barth\u00e9lemy, Saint-Martin/Sint Maarten and Anguilla lie to the north-northwest of the country. To the east and northeast are Antigua and Barbuda, and to the southeast is the small uninhabited island of Redonda (part of Antigua and Barbuda) and the island of Montserrat.\nSaint Kitts and Nevis were among the first islands in the Caribbean to be colonised by Europeans. Saint Kitts was home to the first British and French Caribbean colonies, and thus has also been titled \"The Mother Colony of the West Indies\".[9] It is also the most recent British territory in the Caribbean to become independent, gaining independence in 1983.\nThe Kalinago, the pre-European inhabitants of Saint Kitts, called the island Liamuiga, roughly translating as \"fertile land\".[10]\nIt is thought that Christopher Columbus, the first European to see the islands in 1493, named the larger island San Crist\u00f3bal, after Saint Christopher, his patron saint and that of travellers. New studies suggest that Columbus named the island Sant Yago (Saint James), and that the name San Crist\u00f3bal was in fact given by Columbus to the island now known as Saba, 32\u00a0km (20\u00a0mi) northwest. Saint Kitts was well documented as San Crist\u00f3bal by the 17th century.[1] The first English colonists kept the English translation of this name, and dubbed it St. Christopher's Island. In the 17th century, a common nickname for Christopher was Kit(t); hence, the island came to be informally referred to as Saint Kitt's Island, later further shortened to Saint Kitts.[1]\nColumbus gave Nevis the name San Mart\u00edn (Saint Martin).[10] The current name Nevis is derived from a Spanish name Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de las Nieves, meaning \"Our Lady of the Snows\", a reference to the 4th-century Catholic miracle of a summertime snowfall on the Esquiline Hill in Rome.[1] It is not known who chose this name for the island, but it is thought that white clouds which usually wreath the top of Nevis Peak reminded someone of the miracle.[11][1]\nToday, the Constitution refers to the state as both Saint Kitts and Nevis and Saint Christopher and Nevis;  the former is the one most commonly used, but the latter is generally used for diplomatic relations.\nThe name of the first inhabitants, pre-Arawakan peoples who settled the islands perhaps as early as 3000 years ago, is not known.[12] They were followed by the Arawak peoples, or Ta\u00edno, about 1000 BC.[citation needed] The Island Caribs invaded about 800 AD.[13]:\u200a10\nChristopher Columbus was the first European to sight the islands in 1493.[14][8] The first settlers were the English in 1623, led by Thomas Warner, who established a settlement at Old Road Town on the west coast of St Kitts after achieving an agreement with the Carib chief Ouboutou Tegremante.[13]:\u200a15\u201318\u200a[8] The French later also settled on St Kitts in 1625 under Pierre Belain d'Esnambuc.[8] As a result, both parties agreed to partition the island into French and English sectors. From 1628 onward the English also began settling on Nevis.[8]\nThe French and English, intent on exploitation of the island's resources,[15] encountered resistance from the native Caribs (Kalinago), who waged war during the first three years of the settlements' existence.[16][17] The Europeans resolved to rid themselves of this problem. An ideological campaign was waged by colonial chroniclers, dating back to the Spanish, as they produced literature which denied the Kalinagos' humanity (a literary tradition carried through the late-seventeenth century by such authors as Jean-Baptiste du Tertre and Pere Labat).[17] In 1626 the Anglo-French settlers joined forces to massacre the Kalinago at a place that became known as Bloody Point, allegedly to preempt a Carib plan to expel or kill all European settlers.[18][19] Thereafter, the English and French established large sugar plantations which were worked by imported African slaves. This made the planter-colonists rich, but drastically altered the islands' demographics as black slaves soon came to outnumber Europeans.[14][13]:\u200a26\u201331\nA Spanish expedition of 1629 sent to enforce Spanish claims destroyed the English and French colonies and deported the settlers back to their respective countries. As part of the war settlement in 1630, the Spanish permitted the re-establishment of the English and French colonies.[13]:\u200a19\u201323\u200a Spain later formally recognised Britain's claim to St Kitts with the Treaty of Madrid (1670), in return for British cooperation in the fight against piracy.[20]\nAs Spanish power declined, Saint Kitts became a key base for English and French expansion in the Caribbean. From St Kitts the British settled the islands of Antigua, Montserrat, Anguilla and Tortola, and the French settled Martinique, the Guadeloupe archipelago and Saint Barth\u00e9lemy. During the late 17th century, France and England fought for control over St Kitts and Nevis, fighting wars in 1667,[13]:\u200a41\u201350\u200a 1689\u201390[13]:\u200a51\u201355\u200a and 1701\u201313. The French renounced their claim to the islands with the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713.[13]:\u200a55\u201360\u200a[8] The islands' economy, already shattered by war, was further harmed by natural disasters: In 1690 an earthquake destroyed Jamestown, capital of Nevis, forcing the construction of a new capital at Charlestown; further damage was caused by a hurricane in 1707.[21]:\u200a105\u2013108\nThe colony had recovered by the turn of the 18th century, and St Kitts had become the richest British Crown Colony per capita in the Caribbean as result of its slave-based sugar industry by the close of the 1700s.[22] The 18th century also saw Nevis, formerly the richer of the two islands, being eclipsed by St Kitts in economic importance.[13]:\u200a75\u200a[21]:\u200a126,\u200a137\u200a Alexander Hamilton, the future U.S. secretary of the Treasury, was born on Nevis in 1755 or 1757.[23]\nAs Britain became embroiled in war with its American colonies, the French decided to use the opportunity to re-capture St Kitts in 1782; however St Kitts was given back and recognised as British territory in the Treaty of Paris (1783).[8][14]\nThe African slave trade was terminated within the British Empire in 1807, and slavery outlawed completely in 1834. A four-year \"apprenticeship\" period followed for each slave, in which they worked for their former owners for wages. On Nevis 8,815 slaves were freed, while St Kitts freed 19,780.[21]:\u200a174\u200a[13]:\u200a110,\u200a114\u2013117\nSaint Kitts and Nevis, along with Anguilla, were federated in 1882. In the first few decades of the 20th century economic hardship and lack of opportunities led to the growth of a labour movement; the Great Depression prompted sugar workers to go on strike in 1935.[24] The 1940s saw the founding of the St Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla Labour Party (later renamed the Saint Kitts and Nevis Labour Party, or SKNLP)[25] under Robert Llewellyn Bradshaw. Bradshaw later became Chief Minister and then Premier of the colony from 1966 to 1978; he sought to gradually bring the sugar-based economy under greater state control.[13]:\u200a151\u2013152\u200a The more conservative-leaning People's Action Movement party (PAM) was founded in 1965.[26]\nAfter a brief period as part of the West Indies Federation (1958\u201362), the islands became an associated state with full internal autonomy in 1967.[8] Residents of Nevis and Anguilla were unhappy with St Kitts's domination of the federation, and Anguilla unilaterally declared independence in 1967.[14][8] In 1971 Britain resumed full control of Anguilla, but it was formally separated in 1980.[27][13]:\u200a147\u2013149\u200a[8] Attention then focused on Nevis, with the Nevis Reformation Party seeking to safeguard the smaller island's interests in any future independent state. Eventually it was agreed that the island would have a degree of autonomy with its own Premier and Assembly, as well as the constitutionally-protected right to unilaterally secede if a referendum on independence resulted in a two-thirds majority in favour.[28][29] St Kitts and Nevis achieved full independence on 19 September 1983.[8][14] Kennedy Simmonds of the PAM, Premier since 1980, duly became the country's first Prime Minister. St Kitts and Nevis opted to remain within the British Commonwealth, retaining Queen Elizabeth as Monarch, represented locally by a Governor-General.\nKennedy Simmonds went on to win elections in 1984, 1989 and 1993, before being unseated when the SKNLP returned to power in 1995 under Denzil Douglas.[14][8]\nIn Nevis, growing discontent with their perceived marginalisation within the federation[30] led to a referendum to separate from St Kitts in 1998, which though resulting a 62% vote to secede, fell short of the required two-thirds majority to be legally enacted.[31][14][8]\nIn late-September 1998, Hurricane Georges caused approximately $458,000,000 in damages and limited GDP growth for the year and beyond. Meanwhile, the sugar industry, in decline for years and propped up only by government subsidies, was closed completely in 2005.[8][32]\nThe 2015 Saint Kitts and Nevis general election was won by Timothy Harris and his recently formed People's Labour Party, with backing from the PAM and the Nevis-based Concerned Citizens' Movement under the 'Team Unity' banner.[33]\nIn June 2020, Team Unity coalition of the incumbent government, led by Prime Minister Timothy Harris, won general elections by defeating Saint Kitts and Nevis Labour Party (SKNLP).[34]\nIn snap general elections held in August 2022, the SKNLP again won, and Terrance Drew became the fourth prime minister of Saint Kitts and Nevis.[35]\nSaint Kitts and Nevis is a sovereign, democratic, and federal state.[36] It is a Commonwealth realm,[37] a constitutional monarchy with the King of Saint Christopher and Nevis, Charles III, as its head of state.[1] The King is represented in the country by a Governor-General, who acts on the advice of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet. The Prime Minister is the leader of the majority party of the House, and the cabinet conducts affairs of state.\nSt. Kitts and Nevis has a unicameral legislature, known as the National Assembly. It is composed of fourteen members: eleven elected representatives (three from the island of Nevis) and three senators, who are appointed by the Governor-General.[1] Two of the senators are appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister, and one, on the advice of the leader of the opposition. Unlike in other countries, the senators do not constitute a separate senate or upper house of parliament, but sit in the National Assembly alongside representatives. All members serve five-year terms. The Prime Minister and the Cabinet answer to the Parliament. Nevis also maintains its own semi-autonomous assembly.\nSaint Kitts and Nevis has no major international disputes. Saint Kitts and Nevis is a full and participating member of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), and the Organisation of American States (OAS).[1]\nSt Kitts & Nevis entered the OAS system on 16 September 1984.[38]\nAt a CARICOM meeting, representative of St. Kitts and Nevis Kennedy Simmons signed the Double Taxation Relief (CARICOM) Treaty 1994, on 6 July 1994.[39]\nThe representatives of seven CARICOM countries signed similar agreements at Sherbourne Conference Centre, St. Michael, Barbados.[39] The countries whose representatives signed the treaties in Barbados were: Antigua & Barbuda, Belize, Grenada, Jamaica, St. Lucia, St. Vincent & the Grenadines and Trinidad & Tobago.[39] This treaty covered income, residence, tax jurisdictions, capital gains, business profits, interest, dividends, royalties and other areas.\nOn 30 June 2014, St. Kitts and Nevis signed a Model 1 agreement with the United States of America in relation to Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA).[40] On the 28 April 2016, the status of the agreement went to \"In Force\".[citation needed]\nSaint Kitts and Nevis has a defence force of 300 personnel. It is mostly involved in policing and drug trade interception.\nMale homosexuality is legal in St. Kitts and Nevis since 29 August 2022.[41] In 2011, the Government of St. Kitts and Nevis said it had \"no mandate from the people\" to abolish the criminalisation of homosexuality among consenting adults.[42]\nThe federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis is divided into fourteen parishes, nine divisions on Saint Kitts and five on Nevis.\nThe country consists of two main islands, Saint Kitts and Nevis, separated at a distance of 2 miles (3\u00a0km) by The Narrows strait.[8] Both are of volcanic origin, with large central peaks covered in tropical rainforest.[1] The majority of the population live along the flatter coastal areas.[1] St Kitts contains several mountain ranges (the North West Range, Central Range and South-West Range) in its centre, where the highest peak of the country, Mount Liamuiga 1,156 metres (3,793\u00a0ft) can be found.[8] Along the east coast can be found the Canada Hills and Conaree Hills. The land narrows considerably in the south-east, forming a much flatter peninsula which contains the largest body of water, the Great Salt Pond. To the southeast, in The Narrows, lies the small isle of Booby Island. There are numerous rivers descending from the mountains of both islands, which provide fresh water to the local population. Nevis, the smaller of the two main islands and roughly circular in shape, is dominated by Nevis Peak 985 metres (3,232\u00a0ft).[1]\nSaint Kitts and Nevis contains two terrestrial ecoregions: Leeward Islands moist forests and Leeward Islands dry forests.[43] The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 4.55/10, ranking it 121st globally out of 172 countries.[44]\nThe national bird is the brown pelican.[45] 176 species of bird have been reported from the country.[46]\nThe national flower is Delonix regia. Common plants include palmetto, hibiscus, bougainvillea, and tamarind. Pinus species are common in the dense forests of islands, and are usually covered by various species of ferns.[47]\nBy the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, St Kitts has a tropical savanna climate (K\u00f6ppen Aw) and Nevis has a tropical monsoon climate (K\u00f6ppen Am).[48] Mean monthly temperatures in Basseterre varies little from 23.9\u00a0\u00b0C (75.0\u00a0\u00b0F) to 26.6\u00a0\u00b0C (79.9\u00a0\u00b0F). Yearly rainfall is approximately 2,400 millimetres (90\u00a0in), although it has varied from 1,356 millimetres (53.4\u00a0in) to 3,183 millimetres (125.3\u00a0in) in the period 1901\u20132015.[49]\nThe population of Saint Kitts and Nevis is around 53,000 (July 2019 est.)[1] and has remained relatively constant for many years.[8] At the end of the nineteenth century there were 42,600 residents, the number slowly rising to a little over 50,000 by the mid-twentieth century.[50] Between 1960 and 1990, the population dropped from 50,000 to 40,000, before rising again to its current level.

In 2005, the government decided to close down the state-owned sugar company, which had experienced losses and was a significant contributor to the fiscal deficit.[8][1]\nSt Kitts and Nevis is heavily dependent upon tourism to drive its economy, a sector which has expanded significantly since the 1970s.[1][8] In 2009 there were 587,479 arrivals to Saint Kitts compared to 379,473 in 2007, an increase of just under 40% in a two-year period, however the tourist sector decreased during the Global financial crisis and has only recently returned to pre-crash levels.[1] In recent years the government has sought to diversify the economy via agriculture, tourism, export-oriented manufacturing, and offshore banking.[1]\nIn July 2015, St Kitts & Nevis and the Republic of Ireland signed a tax agreement to \"promote international co-operation in tax matters through exchange of information.\" The agreement was developed by the OECD Global Forum Working Group on Effective Exchange of Information, which consisted of representatives from OECD member countries and 11 other countries in the Caribbean and other parts of the world.[61]\nSaint Kitts and Nevis has two international airports.

However, while the programme is the oldest in the world, it only catapulted in 2006 when Henley & Partners, a global citizenship advisory firm, became involved in the restructuring of the programme to incorporate donations to the country's sugar industry.[63]\nCitizenship-by-Investment Programmes have been criticised by some researchers due to the risks of corruption, money laundering and tax evasion.[64] According to the official website of St Kitts's Citizenship-by-Investment Programme they offer multiple benefits: \"When you acquire citizenship under the St Kitts & Nevis citizenship programme, you and your family enjoy full citizenship for life, which can be passed on to future generations by descent.

It is in Saint Thomas Middle Island Parish, and just to the east of Middle Island town. Its current population is estimated at 1,647.\nOld Road Town was settled on January 28, 1624, by Thomas Warner, his wife Rebecca, his son Edward and 14 others. The settlers were at first on good terms with the island's native Carib residents, though that lasted only a very few years in the Carib's homeland.\nRather than cultivating sugar cane, it was tobacco that had drawn Warner to the island, and it was the island's tobacco crop that first supported the settlement. The colony prospered and more settlements were built and by 1727, Basseterre became the capital after the expulsion of the French in 1713.\nOld Road has developed with  tourism, fishing, and farming industries. There is a new fisheries complex in town, funded by the Taiwanese government.\nOutside of Old Road are a number of historic Carib petroglyphs.\nThe St. Thomas/Trinity Strikers, a football team in the Saint Kitts Premier Division (officially known as the SKNFA Digicel Premier League), are based in Old Road and the surrounding Trinity area.\nThis Saint Kitts and Nevis location article is a stub.
