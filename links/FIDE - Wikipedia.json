{"FIDE - Wikipedia": {"text": "The International Chess Federation or World Chess Federation,[2][3] commonly referred to by its French acronym FIDE (/\u02c8fi\u02d0de\u026a/ FEE-day F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale des \u00c9checs),[4] is an international organization based in Switzerland that connects the various national chess federations and acts as the governing body of international chess competition. FIDE was founded in Paris, France, on July 20, 1924.[5] Its motto is Gens una sumus, Latin for \"We are one Family\". In 1999, FIDE was recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). As of May 2022, there are 200 member federations of FIDE.[6]\nFIDE's most visible activity is organizing the World Chess Championship since 1948. FIDE also organizes world championships for women, juniors, seniors, and the disabled.[7] Another flagship event is the Chess Olympiad, a biennial chess tournament organized since 1924, in which national teams compete. In alternate years, FIDE also organizes the World Team Championship, in which the best teams from the previous Olympiad compete.\nAs part of the World Chess Championship cycle, FIDE also organizes the Candidates Tournament, which determines who will challenge the reigning World Champion, and the qualifying tournaments for the Candidates, such as the Chess World Cup, the FIDE Grand Prix, and the FIDE Grand Swiss Tournament 2019.\nFIDE is recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as the supreme body responsible for the organization of chess and its championships at global and continental levels.[8] Other tournaments are not overseen directly by FIDE, but they generally observe FIDE rules and regulations. Some national chess organizations such as the US Chess Federation use minor differences to FIDE rules.\nFIDE defines the rules of chess, both for individual games (i.e. the board and moves) and for the conduct of international competitions. The international competition rules are the basis for local competitions, although local bodies are allowed to modify these rules to a certain extent. FIDE awards a number of organizational titles, including International Arbiter, which signifies that the recipient is competent and trusted to oversee top-class competitions.[9]\nFIDE calculates the Elo ratings of players[10] and awards titles for achievement in competitive play, such as the Grandmaster title. It also awards titles to composers and solvers of chess problems and studies.\nFIDE funds and manages outreach programs, such as the Chess for Freedom program[11] and awards such as, since 2020, the Svetozar Gligoric Award for fair play.[12]\nCorrespondence chess (chess played by post, email or on online servers) is regulated by the International Correspondence Chess Federation, an independent body that cooperates with FIDE where appropriate.\nThe FIDE budget for 2022 was \u20ac12.84\u00a0million, an increase from the 2021 budget which was \u20ac4\u00a0million.[13][14] Income is primarily from rights to tournaments such as the Olympiad and World Championship, from various fees and commissions, and from corporate sponsorship and donations.\nIn April 1914, an initiative was taken in St. Petersburg, Russia, to form an international chess federation. Another attempt was made in July 1914 during the Mannheim International Chess Tournament, but further efforts temporarily came to an end as a result of the outbreak of World War I. In 1920, another attempt to organize an international federation was made at the Gothenburg Tournament.[15]\nPlayers made the first attempt to produce rules for world championship matches\u2014in 1922, world champion Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca proposed the \"London rules\": the first player to win six games outright would win the match; playing sessions would be limited to five hours; the time limit would be 40 moves in 2.5 hours each; the champion would be obliged to defend his title within one year of receiving a challenge from a recognized master; the champion would decide the date of the match; the champion was not obliged to accept a challenge for a purse of less than $10,000; 20% of the purse was to be paid to the title holder, with the remainder being divided, 60 percent to the winner of the match, and 40% to the loser; the highest purse bid must be accepted. Alekhine, Bogoljubov, Mar\u00f3czy, R\u00e9ti, Rubinstein, Tartakower and Vidmar promptly signed them.[16] The only match played under those rules was Capablanca vs Alekhine in 1927.[17]\nIn 1922, the Russian master Eugene Znosko-Borovsky, while participating in an international tournament in London, announced that a tournament would be held during the 8th Sports Olympic Games in Paris in 1924 and would be hosted by the French Chess Federation. On July 20, 1924 the participants at the Paris tournament founded FIDE as a kind of players' union.[15][18][19] In its early years, FIDE had little power, and was poorly financed.\nFIDE's congresses in 1925 and 1926 expressed a desire to become involved in managing the world championship. FIDE was largely happy with the \"London Rules\", but claimed that the requirement for a purse of $10,000 was impracticable and called upon Capablanca to come to an agreement with the leading masters to revise the Rules.[20]\nFIDE's third congress, in Budapest in 1926, also decided to organize a Chess Olympiad. The invitations were, however, late in being sent, with the result that only four countries participated, and the competition was called the Little Olympiad. The winner was Hungary, followed by Yugoslavia, Romania, and Germany. In 1927, FIDE began organizing the First Chess Olympiad during its 4th Congress in London. The official title of the tournament was the \"Tournament of Nations\", or \"World Team Championship\", but \"Chess Olympiad\" became a more popular title. The event was won by Hungary, with 16 teams competing.[15]\nIn 1928 FIDE recognized Bogoljubow as \"Champion of FIDE\" after he won a match against Max Euwe.[20] Alekhine, the reigning world champion, attended part of the 1928 Congress and agreed to place future matches for the world title under the auspices of FIDE, although any match with Capablanca should be under the same conditions as in Buenos Aires, 1927, i.e. including the requirement for a purse of at least $10,000. FIDE accepted this and decided to form a commission to modify the London Rules for future matches, though this commission never met; by the time of the 1929 Congress, a world championship match between Alekhine and Bogoljubow was under way, held neither under the auspices of FIDE nor in accordance with the London Rules.[20]\nWhile negotiating his 1937 World Championship re-match with Alekhine, Euwe proposed that if he retained the title, FIDE should manage the nomination of future challengers and the conduct of championship matches. FIDE had been trying since 1935 to introduce rules on how to select challengers, and its various proposals favored selection by some sort of committee. While they were debating procedures in 1937 and Alekhine and Euwe were preparing for their re-match later that year, the Dutch Chess Federation proposed that a super-tournament (AVRO) of ex-champions and rising stars should be held to select the next challenger. FIDE rejected this proposal and at their second attempt nominated Salo Flohr as the official challenger. Euwe then declared that: if he retained his title against Alekhine he was prepared to meet Flohr in 1940 but he reserved the right to arrange a title match either in 1938 or 1939 with Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca, who had lost the title to Alekhine in 1927; if Euwe lost his title to Capablanca then FIDE's decision should be followed and Capablanca would have to play Flohr in 1940. Most chess writers and players strongly supported the Dutch super-tournament proposal and opposed the committee processes favored by FIDE. While this confusion went unresolved: Euwe lost his title to Alekhine; the AVRO tournament in 1938 was won by Paul Keres under a tie-breaking rule, with Reuben Fine placed second and Capablanca and Flohr in the bottom places; and the outbreak of World War II in 1939 cut short the controversy.[21][22] Although competitive chess continued in many countries, including some that were under Nazi occupation, there was no international competition and FIDE was inactive during the war.\nFrom the time of Emanuel Lasker's defeat of Wilhelm Steinitz in 1894, until 1946, a new World Champion had won the title by defeating the former champion in a match. Alexander Alekhine's death created an interregnum that made the normal procedure impossible. The situation was confused, with many respected players and commentators offering different solutions. FIDE found it difficult to organize the early discussions on how to resolve the interregnum, because problems with money and travel in the aftermath of World War II prevented many countries from sending representatives, most notably the Soviet Union. The shortage of clear information resulted in otherwise responsible magazines publishing rumors and speculation, which only made the situation more confused.[23] See Interregnum of World Chess Champions for more details.\nThis situation was exacerbated by the Soviet Union having long refused to join FIDE, and by this time it was clear that about half the credible contenders were Soviet citizens. The Soviet Union realized, however, it could not afford to be left out of the discussions regarding the vacant world championship, and in 1947 sent a telegram apologizing for the absence of Soviet representatives and requesting that the USSR be represented in future FIDE Committees.[23]\nThe eventual solution was similar to FIDE's initial proposal and to a proposal put forward by the Soviet Union (authored by Mikhail Botvinnik). The 1938 AVRO tournament was used as the basis for the 1948 Championship Tournament. The AVRO tournament had brought together the eight players who were, by general acclamation, the best players in the world at the time. Two of the participants at AVRO\u2014Alekhine and former world champion Capablanca\u2014had since died; but FIDE decided that the other six participants at AVRO would play a quadruple round-robin tournament. These players were: Max Euwe (from The Netherlands); Botvinnik, Paul Keres and Salo Flohr (from the Soviet Union); and Reuben Fine and Samuel Reshevsky (from the United States). FIDE soon accepted a Soviet request to substitute Vasily Smyslov for Flohr, and Fine withdrew in order to continue his degree studies in psychiatry, so five players competed, in a quintuple round robin. Botvinnik won, thus becoming world champion, ending the interregnum.[23]\nThe proposals which led to the 1948 Championship Tournament also specified the procedure by which challengers for the World Championship would be selected in a three-year cycle: countries affiliated with FIDE would send players to Zonal tournaments (the number varied depending on the number of strong players each country had); the players who gained the top places in these would compete in an Interzonal tournament (later split into two, then three tournaments as the number of countries and eligible players increased[24]); the highest-placed players from the Interzonal would compete in the Candidates Tournament, along with the loser of the previous title match and the runner-up in the previous Candidates Tournament; and the winner of the Candidates played a title match against the champion.[23] From 1950 until 1962 inclusive, the Candidates Tournament was a multi-round round-robin\u2014how and why it was changed are described below.\nFIDE found itself embroiled in some controversies relating to the American player Bobby Fischer. The first controversy took place when Fischer alleged that, at the 1962 Candidates Tournament in Cura\u00e7ao, the Soviet players Tigran Petrosian, Paul Keres and Efim Geller had pre-arranged draws in their games played amongst themselves, and that Viktor Korchnoi, another Soviet player, had been instructed to lose to them (Fischer had placed 4th, well behind Petrosian, Keres and Geller). Grandmaster Yuri Averbakh, a member of the Soviet delegation at the tournament, confirmed in 2002 that Petrosian, Keres and Geller privately agreed to draw their games.[25] FIDE responded by changing the format of Candidates Tournaments from a multi-round round-robin to a series of elimination matches, initially 10\u201312 games in duration; however, by the 1970s, the Candidates final would be as long as 24 games.\nThen, in 1969, Fischer refused to play in the U.S. Championship because of disagreements about the tournament's format and prize fund. Since that event was being treated as a Zonal tournament, Fischer forfeited his right to compete for the right to challenge World Champion Boris Spassky in 1972. Grandmaster Pal Benko agreed to relinquish his qualifying place at the Interzonal in Fischer's favor, and the other participants waived their right to claim the spot. FIDE president Max Euwe interpreted the rules very flexibly to allow Fischer to play in the 1970 Interzonal at Palma de Mallorca, which he won convincingly. Fischer then crushed Mark Taimanov, Bent Larsen (both 6\u20130) and Tigran Petrosian in the 1971 Candidates\nTournament and won the title match with Spassky to become world champion.[26]\nAfter winning the world championship, Fischer criticized the existing championship match format (24 games; the champion retained the title if the match was tied) on the grounds that it encouraged whoever got an early lead to play for draws. While this dispute was going on, Anatoly Karpov won the right to challenge in 1975. Fischer refused to accept any match format other than the one he proposed. Among Fischer's demands was a requirement that the challenger must beat him by at least two games in order to take his title (Fischer proposed a match format in which the first player to win 10 games wins, with draws not counting, but if the result is 9\u20139 it is considered a tie). The FIDE argued that it was unfair for a challenger to be able to beat the world champion, yet not take his title. Fischer would not back down, and eventually FIDE awarded the title to Karpov by default.[27] Some commentators have questioned whether FIDE president Max Euwe did as much as he could have to prevent Fischer from forfeiting his world title.[26]\nFIDE had a number of conflicts with the Soviet Chess Federation. These conflicts included:[26]\nDuring his period as president of FIDE (1970\u20131978) Max Euwe strove to increase the number of member countries, and Florencio Campomanes (president 1982\u20131995) continued this policy, with each member nation receiving one vote. Former world champion Anatoly Karpov later said this was a mixed blessing, as the inclusion of so many small, poor countries led to a \"leadership vacuum at the head of the world of chess......\"[26][28] Yuri Averbakh said the presence of so many weak countries made it easy to manipulate decisions.[29]\nThe events leading to Garry Kasparov's winning the world championship involved FIDE in two controversies. While arranging the Candidates Tournament semi-final matches to be played in 1983, FIDE accepted bids to host Kasparov versus Victor Korchnoi in Pasadena, California. The Soviet Union refused to accept this, either because it feared Kasparov would defect or because it thought Kasparov was the greater threat to reigning champion Anatoly Karpov. Their refusal would have meant that Kasparov forfeited his chance of challenging for the title. FIDE president Florencio Campomanes negotiated with the Soviet Union, and the match was played in London.[28][30]\nIn the 1984 world championship match between Karpov and Kasparov the winner was to be the first to win six games. In the first 27 games Karpov gained a 5\u20130 lead but by the end of the 48th Kasparov had reduced this to 5\u20133.[31] At this point the match had lasted for 159 days (from September 1984 to February 1985). Then the match was ended without result by Florencio Campomanes, the President of the World Chess Federation, and a new match was announced to start a few months later. The termination was controversial, as both players stated that they preferred the match to continue.[32] Announcing his decision at a press conference, Campomanes cited the health of the players, which had been strained by the length of the match. Kasparov won the second match and became world champion.[28][33][34]\nIn 1992 Nigel Short surprised the world by winning the Candidates Tournament and thus becoming the official challenger for Kasparov's world title. FIDE very quickly accepted a bid from Manchester (England) to host the title match in 1993. But at that time Short was travelling to Greece and could not be consulted as FIDE's rules required. On learning of the situation Short contacted Kasparov, who had distrusted FIDE and its president, Florencio Campomanes ever since Campomanes had stopped his title match against Karpov in 1984.  Kasparov and Short concluded that FIDE had failed to get them the best financial deal available and announced that they would \"play under the auspices of a new body, the \"Professional Chess Association\" (PCA). FIDE stripped Kasparov of his FIDE title and dropped Kasparov and Short from the official rating list. It also announced a title match between Karpov and Jan Timman, whom Short had defeated in the semi-final and final stages of the Candidates Tournament.  Kasparov and Karpov won their matches and there were now two players claiming to be world champion.[35]\nIn 1994 Kasparov concluded that breaking away from FIDE had been a mistake, because both commercial sponsors and the majority of grandmasters disliked the split in the world championship.[36] Kasparov started trying to improve relations with FIDE and supported Campomanes' bid for re-election as president of FIDE. But many FIDE delegates regarded Campomanes as corrupt and in 1995 he agreed to resign provided his successor was Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, president of the Republic of Kalmykia.[37]\nIn the next few years several attempts to re-unify the world championship failed for various reasons \u2013 notably inability to finance a match or Kasparov's opposition to any plan that required him to play in a qualifying series rather than go straight into a re-unification match. In 2000 Vladimir Kramnik defeated Kasparov in a match for what was now the Braingames World Chess Championship (the PCA had collapsed by this time). But Kramnik was also unwilling to play in a qualifying series, and objected strongly to FIDE's attempt to have the world championship decided by annual knock-out tournaments and to reduce the time limits for games, changes which FIDE hoped would make the game more interesting to outsiders.[37][38]\nFinally in 2006 a re-unification match was played between Kramnik and Veselin Topalov, which Kramnik won after an unpleasant controversy which led to one game being awarded to Topalov.[37][39]\nBut the split in the world title had after-effects, as shown by FIDE's complicated regulations for the 2007\u20139 world championship cycle. Because Topalov was unable to compete in the 2007 World Chess Championship Tournament, FIDE decided he should have a \"fast track\" entry into the 2007\u20132009 cycle. And FIDE also decided that, if Kramnik did not win the 2007 championship tournament, he should play a championship match in 2008 against the winner\u2014and this provision became applicable because Viswanathan Anand won the tournament and thus became world champion.\nIn 1999, FIDE was recognised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Two years later, it introduced the IOC's anti-drugs rules to chess, as part of its campaign for chess to become part of the Olympic Games.[40]\nIn 2012 FIDE entered into a commercial agreement, initially planned to last until 2021, with the company Agon Limited. This company was given rights to organize and commercially exploit the World Chess Championship and the associated events in the World Championship cycle.[41] The first tournament it organized was the London FIDE Grand Prix event in September 2012,[42] followed by the London Candidates Tournament in March 2013,[43] and the Chennai World Chess Championship in November 2013.[44]\nAgon subsequently organized the four events in the FIDE Grand Prix 2014\u201315,[45] the Candidates Tournament in 2014,[46] and the World Chess Championship in 2014.[47]\nAgon had been founded in 2012 in Jersey by Andrew Paulson as the sole shareholder.[48] On February 20, 2012, an agreement between Agon and FIDE was made, subject to approval by the 2012 FIDE General Assembly.[41] This approval was forthcoming in September 2012.[49] In October 2014, Agon was sold to its current CEO Ilya Merenzon for the sum of one pound.[42] At the September 2016 FIDE General Assembly, it was resolved that Agon should institute a corporate presence in a locale with more transparency. Merenzon said that they would register in the United Kingdom within a few months.[50] As a result, a new company, World Chess Limited, was registered shortly after, replacing Agon as the rights holder in the agreement with FIDE.\nKirsan Ilyumzhinov was happy with the agreement on the basis that now FIDE itself did not have to expend resources to find organizers for its premier events. The issue of financial guarantees was also important, though as explained below, these have not always materialized. His estimation of 10\u201312 million euros to FIDE from the coming cycles has not yet come to fruition either.[51][52]\nThe condition that Agon would be the sole organizer of Championship events was disputed originally by principally the Bulgarian Chess Federation, with respect to the Candidates matches for 2012.[53] In early 2014, a purported agreement between Paulson and FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov was leaked, and then published by Chess.com (and others), which allegedly indicated that Paulson was simply a front man with Ilyumzhinov the ultimate benefactor of Agon.[54] In that Chess.com article Malcolm Pein is quoted as having twice been told by Paulson that Ilyuzmhinov owned Agon, and in a New In Chess article Nigel Short asserted he had also been told this personally by Paulson.[55] In response, FIDE's deputy vice president Georgios Makropoulos pointed out that the purported contract was a draft document.[56] The FIDE Ethics Commission ruled in September 2015 that Ilyumzhinov did not violate the FIDE Code of Ethics.[57][58]\nIn July 2018, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov was ousted as FIDE President, after having been in office for 23 years, since 1995. Being subjected to US sanctions for his business dealings with the Syrian government, Ilyumzhinov was forced out and did not run for re-election in the 2018 FIDE elections. The Greek Georgios Makropoulos, who had been General Secretary since 1990 and number two in the organization under Kirsan's Presidency, was the first to announce his ticket. He was followed by the Englishman Nigel Short, a world title contender in the World Chess Championship 1993 against Garry Kasparov. The last to announce his candidacy was Arkady Dvorkovich, an economist who had served as Russian deputy prime minister and was also a member of the Supervisory Board of the Russian Chess Federation. Dvorkovich was also one of the chief organizers of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Dvorkovich was placed in the US Treasury pre-sanctions list in 2018 as a top Russian government employee.[59]\nIn the elections, held in Batumi (Georgia) in October 2018, Dvorkovich won by 103 votes to 78[60] against Makropoulos, after Nigel Short withdrew his candidacy at the last minute and expressed his support to the Russian candidate.\nAfter the 2018 FIDE elections and the appointment of a new FIDE President, the new management took regaining control over the World Championship cycle as one of their top priorities. In January 2019, FIDE Director-General Emil Sutovsky announced that a new contract has been signed that continues a scaled-back relationship with World Chess (formerly known as AGON) through 2021. In virtue of this new agreement, FIDE reasserted control over the 2020 Candidates and the World Championship match, which from now on will undergo an open bidding procedure. Agon/World Chess only retained organizational and commercial rights over the FIDE Grand Prix Series, limited until 2021.\nAt FIDE's general assembly in Chennai, India, in August 2022 Dvorkovich got re-elected by 157 votes to 16 against Ukraine's Andrii Baryshpolets.[61]\nOn February 27, 2022, FIDE issued an official statement condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine. As a consequence, Russia and Belarus were forbidden from hosting official FIDE events. The decision to hold the 2022 Chess Olympiad and the 2022 FIDE congress in Moscow was also revoked.[62] The Russian and Belarusian national teams were banned from participating in FIDE tournaments, although individual players could compete if they complied with strict regulations, in which case their federation and flag was replaced with FIDE and its banner.[63]\nOn March 22, 2022, FIDE decided to issue a six month ban from competing in rated tournaments against Russian grandmaster Sergey Karjakin. Karjakin had posted controversial statements on Twitter in which he declared his support for the invasion of Ukraine and for President Vladimir Putin's characterization of the war as a fight against Nazism. FIDE argued that Karjakin's statements had shed a negative light on chess and on the federation and found that he had violated the FIDE code of ethics.[64] Sergei Shipov, who also publicly commented in favor of Russia, was not sanctioned, because FIDE decided that his statements were less provocative.[62]", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fide#cite_note-12", "

Random Chess Championship 2019 - Wikipedia": {"text": "The FIDE World Fischer Random Chess Championship 2019 (WFRCC) was the first world championship in Fischer random chess officially recognized by the international chess federation FIDE.[1] Previous unofficial championships had been held, with the most recent winner being Magnus Carlsen in 2018. The competition started on April 28, 2019, with the first qualifying tournaments, which took place online and were open to all interested participants; and continued with further rounds up to the quarter-finals, which were also online. The semi-finals and final were played over the board between October 27 to November 2, 2019, in the Henie Onstad Kunstsenter in B\u00e6rum in Norway. The winner of the final was Wesley So, defeating Magnus Carlsen 13.5\u20132.5, to become the first FIDE world champion in Fischer random chess. Over the course of the competition, various time controls were applied, with longer games being weighted more heavily.[2]\nThe championship included several rounds with different time controls, organizational forms and access requirements.\nThe first qualifying round was open to all interested chess players without a title and was played online via the chess server chess.com. Each of 32 groups played a Swiss-system tournament with 9 rounds and a time control of 10 minutes for the entire game plus an increment of 2 seconds per move. The top 5 players from each group qualified for the second qualifying round, for a total of 160 players.\nThe second qualifying round was open to the 160 qualifiers from the first qualifying round as well as all FIDE title holders. Each of 12 groups played a Swiss-system tournament with 9 rounds, also with a time control of 10 minutes plus 2 seconds increment. The top 7 players from each group qualified for the third qualifying round, for a total of 84 players.\nThe 84 qualifiers from the second qualifying round were divided into 6 groups of 14 players each. Each group was supplemented by two invited chess players. Each group of 16 players played a single-elimination tournament. In each round of the tournament, the two players played a \u201cminimatch\u201d consisting of two games with opposite color assignments. In case of a tie, another minimatch with shorter time control was played, and another one with even shorter time control if the tie persisted. If there was still no decisive result after the third minimatch, the pairing was decided by an Armageddon game.\nWhile the first two qualifying rounds brought a number of surprises, the winners of the third qualifying round were all near the top of the FIDE world rankings in standard chess. Nevertheless, some prominent players were knocked out, including Jan-Krzysztof Duda, Sergey Karjakin, Alexander Grischuk and Leinier Dom\u00ednguez. The following 6 players qualified for the quarterfinals:\nTwo more players were seeded directly into the quarterfinals: The runner-up in the World Chess Championship 2018 in standard chess, Fabiano Caruana, and the runner-up in the unofficial Fischer Random world championship match 2018, Hikaru Nakamura.\nThe quarterfinals were played online[3] from October 4 to 6 2019. The first day saw matches between pairs of players. On the second day, the four losers played each other in pairs in a sort of repechage. On the third day, the winners of the first two days played each other in pairs. The three winners qualified for the semifinals: Caruana, Wesley So and Ian Nepomniachtchi. Each match of the quarterfinals consisted of two \u201cslow\u201d rapid games (45 minutes for 40 moves plus 15 minutes for the rest, without increment), two \u201cfast\u201d rapid games (15 minutes plus 2 seconds increment) and 2 blitz games (3 minutes plus 2 seconds increment). FIDE did not explain why the slow rapid games were not called classical when 60 minutes is the minimum for a classical game. The games were weighted differently: 3 points for each slow rapid game, 2 points for each fast rapid game and 1 point for each blitz game. Only one match was tied after the 6 games, the one between Nepomniachtchi and Alireza Firouzja on the first day. Nepomniachtchi won the deciding Armageddon game.[4][5]\nThe matches between Caruana and Nakamura and between Nepomniachtchi and Firouzja ended when a player won by reaching 6\u00bd points. The match between So and Fedoseev was also already decided after the third game with 6\u00bd:1\u00bd points in favour of So. Nevertheless, the two players decided to play the remaining three games, even though they were no longer relevant for the qualification for the semifinals.[6]\nThe semifinals and the finals took place from October 27 to November 2. In the semifinals, the three qualifiers from the quarterfinals were joined by the world champion in standard chess and the unofficial world champion in Chess960, Magnus Carlsen. The schedule was as follows:\nSo won the semifinal match against Nepomniachtchi by reaching a score of 13\u20135 in the third fast rapid game. Carlsen won the semifinal match against Caruana by reaching a score of 12\u00bd-7\u00bd in the last fast rapid game. Thus, So and Carlsen qualified for the final, while Nepomniachtchi and Caruana played for third place.[8]\nThe bracket below shows the first-place match between Carlsen and So as well as the third-place match between Nepomniachtchi and Caruana. The matches took place concurrently. So won the championship, defeating Carlsen 13\u00bd-2\u00bd. Nepomniachtchi beat Caruana 12\u00bd-5\u00bd to take third place.[9]", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIDE_World_Fischer_Random_Chess_Championship_2019", "

pinyin: H\u00f3u Y\u00ecf\u00e1n pronunciation\u00a0(help\u00b7info); born 27 February 1994)[1][2][3] is a Chinese chess grandmaster, four-time Women's World Chess Champion and the second highest rated female player of all time.[4]  Once a chess prodigy, she was the youngest female player ever to qualify for the title of grandmaster (at the age of 14 years, 6 months, 2 days) and the youngest ever to win the Women's World Chess Championship (at age 16).\nAt the age of 12, Hou became the youngest player ever to participate in the Women's World Championship (Yekaterinburg 2006) and the Chess Olympiad (Torino 2006).[5] In June 2007, she became the youngest Chinese Women's Champion ever. She achieved the titles of Woman FIDE Master in January 2004, Woman Grandmaster in January 2007, and Grandmaster in August 2008. In 2010, she won the 2010 Women's World Championship in Hatay, Turkey at age 16. She won the next three championships in which the title was decided by a match (in 2011, 2013 and 2016, with a total of ten wins to zero losses and fourteen draws against three different opponents), but was either eliminated early or she declined to participate in the championships in which the title was decided by a knockout tournament (in 2012, 2015 and 2017).\nHou is the third woman ever to be rated among the world's top 100 players, after Maia Chiburdanidze and Judit Polg\u00e1r. She is widely regarded as the best active female chess player, \"leaps and bounds\" ahead of her competitors.[6] As of July\u00a02022,[update] she has been the No. 1 ranked woman in the world since September 2015, and is 51 points ahead of the No. 2 ranked Aleksandra Goryachkina.[7] She was named in the BBC's 100 Women programme in 2017.[8] She has been semi-retired since 2018, and became a professor at Shenzhen University in 2020, at the age of 26.[4]\nHou started playing chess regularly at the age of five,[9] but already was fascinated by the game when she was three years old. Hou's father, Hou Xuejian, a magistrate,[10] often took his young daughter to a bookstore after dinner. He noticed that the little girl liked to stare at glass chess pieces behind the window. He later bought his daughter her first chess set. The three-year-old was able to beat her father and grandmother after a few weeks. In 1999, her father engaged a chess mentor, IM Tong Yuanming, for his five-year-old daughter.[11] Tong later said that Hou was an unusual talent, showing \"strong confidence, distinguished memory, calculating ability and fast reaction\".[11] Hou has said that she took up chess because she was fascinated by the pieces.[12]\nIn 2003, Hou played against the chief coach of the Chinese national men's and women's chess teams, Ye Jiangchuan, for the first time. The chess master was surprised that the nine-year-old could identify almost all of his weak moves. \"Then I knew she was an exceptional genius\", Ye said. That year, Hou became the youngest member of the national team and won first place at the World Youth Championship for girls under age ten. In June 2007, she became China's youngest national champion.[11]\nShe was admitted to the National Chess Center, an academy for young talented players from all over the country,[13] in Beijing when she was ten,[14] with leading Chinese grandmasters Ye Jiangchuan and Yu Shaoteng as her trainers.[15][16] In order to better support her chess career, her family relocated to Beijing in 2003. Hou's mother, Wang Qian, a former nurse, accompanied her to many international tournaments when Hou was young. Hou was homeschooled.[10] As a teenager, she listed her interests as reading and studying and she listed her favorite chess player as Bobby Fischer.[13][12]\nHou has attempted to balance chess with life outside of it. Against the wishes of her trainer, she enrolled in Peking University in 2012, studying International Relations. She took a full course load and participated in many extracurricular activities. She was offered a Rhodes Scholarship, and studied for a Master of Public Policy at St Hilda's College, Oxford with the Blavatnik School of Government.[17][18] Competitors give her credit for what she has achieved in spite of her lack of preparation,[opinion] and for her life outside of chess. Vladimir Kramnik said: \"If she wants to stay the best female player, she can probably do nothing. If she wants to achieve her potential, she must concentrate fully on chess.\"[19] Hou is aware of this as well, but nonetheless chooses to treat chess as a hobby, not a career.[20] She said in 2018: \"I want to be the best, but you also have to have a life.\"[19]\nIn 2020, at age 26, Hou became the youngest ever professor at Shenzhen University where she is a professor at the School of Physical Education,[21] which includes chess in its Sports Training Program.[22]\nHou Yifan's first major tournament was on 31 August\u201312 September 2003 at the Chinese Team Chess Championship (Open) in Tianjin.[23] She scored 3/7 with a 2246 performance rating.[24]\nShe won her first international tournament when she came first (9\u00bd/11; +8 =3 \u22120, TPR 2121) in the girl's under-10 section of the World Youth Championship in Halkidiki, Greece in October\u2013November 2003.[25] In November, she made her debut in the National Women's Chess Championship, held at Shanwei, Guangdong.[26] She finished in 14th place with 3\u00bd/9 with a performance rating of 2202.[27]\nOn 1 January 2004, she received her first International FIDE rating of 2168, which automatically qualified her for the title of Woman FIDE Master. In April, she competed at the Chinese Team Chess Championship (Women's) in Jinan, Shandong.[28] She scored 1\u00bd/7 (TPR 2096) having faced an average opposition rating (Rc) of 2316.[29]\nIn November, she finished first jointly with Yu Yangyi, Jules Moussard, and Raymond Song, but third on tiebreaks in the boy's under-ten section of the World Youth Championship, held in Heraklio, Crete (9/11; +8 =2 \u22121; TPR 2119).[30]\nAt the 11th Asian Women's Championship in Beirut, Lebanon from 4\u201311 December 2004, she came in eleventh with a score of 4\u00bd/9 (+4 =1 \u22124; TPR 2278). The event was won by Wang Yu with 6\u00bd/9.[31]\nIn February, she competed at the fourth Aeroflot Open (Group C) in Moscow,[32] where she scored 2/5(TPR 2111).[33]\nIn April, she finished fifth with a score of 7/11 (+6 =2 \u22123) (tied for fourth) at the Three Arrows Cup 2005 ladies tournament in Jinan, China. In that tournament, she defeated international master Almira Skripchenko and achieved a performance rating of 2393.[34]\nFrom 28 June\u20136 July at the second China-France Youth Match at Shenzhen, Guangdong, Hou Yifan scored 3/8 (+2 =2 \u22124, TPR 2324). The Chinese team (Zhou Jianchao, Zhao Jun, Zhao Xue and Hou) won the match 19\u201313.[35]\nIn July, at the Festival Open International des Jeunes in Saint-L\u00f4, France, she came second out of 75 players with 6/8(TPR 2305), behind Wen Yang.[36][37] In 18\u201329 July at the World Youth Chess Championship in Belfort, France, Hou Yifan, seeded eighth, came in fifth in the Boy's Under-12 Section with 8/11 (+5 =6, TPR 2171).[38]\nIn October, she qualified for the World Women's Chess Championship to be held in March 2006. Despite being rated only 2220 and ranked women's number 28 in her own country, she qualified by winning the Chinese Women's Zonal (3.5) tournament, scoring 6/9 points with a performance rating of 2526 against a rating opposition of 2401, ahead of several better-known Chinese players.\nThe sixth World Team Chess Championship was staged in Beersheva, Israel from 31 October to 11 November.[39] China fielded two teams \u2013 the men's and women's, which was only the second time in the championship history when a women's team competed in what traditionally has been a male team event.[40] This was Hou Yifan's first major team tournament and she was the youngest participant there, at eleven years of age.[41]\nShe played as second reserve and finished with 0/3.[42] The Chinese women's team drew one match and lost all of their others (+0 =1 \u22127), finishing last.[43] The tournament was won by Russia, with China (men's) coming in second and Armenia third.[44][45][46]\nIn December, Hou came in second at the China Women Selective Tournament in Beijing for the 37th Chess Olympiad to be held in May\u2013June 2006 in Turin, Italy. She scored 16\u00bd/28 (TPR 2433) and gained 121 elo-points. She made the Olympiad team with the other top finishers, Wang Yu and Shen Yang.[47][48]\nHou reached the third round (the last 16) of the Women's World Chess Championship in March 2006.[49] Despite being rated 2269 and seeded 56th out of 64 players,[50] she defeated IM Nadezhda Kosintseva (rated 2480) of Russia 1\u00bd\u2013\u00bd in the first round, then the former 2000 European champion WGM Natalia Zhukova (2432) of Ukraine 2\u20130 in the second round.[51] She was beaten 0\u20132 by IM Nino Khurtsidze (2430) of Georgia in the third round to finish with a performance rating of 2504.[52][53]\nIn May\u2013June 2006, China came in third and won the bronze metal at the 37th Chess Olympiad in Turin, Italy. Hou Yifan scored 11/13 (+10, =2, \u22121), all played on the fourth board, at her Olympiad debut.[54] For her winning percentage of 84.6%, she won a silver medal for fourth (reserve) board performance, and her performance rating of 2596 was the third highest overall.[55][56]\nThe Chinese Championships for men and women took place in Wuxi, Jiangsu, 25 June\u20136 July 2006.

The team rattled off six straight wins before succumbing to the second seeded Russian team with Hou losing her individual game, as black, to Kateryna Lagno. She ended the Olympiad with a 7/9 score (+6 \u22121 = 2, TPR 2671) leading her team to the silver medal. Her own performance was good enough to receive the silver medal for board one.[144]\nHou is the winner of FIDE Women's Grand Prix 2013\u201314.  From April 8 to April 22, she played in the 4th stage in Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia.  Opening with 3 straight victories, she dominated from start to finish.  Several times as white she eschewed her regular 1.e4 opening move and began with 1.c4 and 1.g3. She finished in 1st place with an 8.5/11 score (+6 =5, TPR 2695).[145]  From June 18 to July 2, she played in the 5th stage in Lopota, Georgia. Leading from start to finish, she won with a 9/11 score (+7 = 4, TPR 2773), a full two points over her nearest competitors.[146] From August 24 to September 6, she competed in the 6th and final stage in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates. She finished joint first with Ju Wenjun with an 8.5/11 score (+6 =5, TPR 2686).[147]\nAt the final leg, the tournament's official awards, Big and Small Cups of Grand Prix, designed and manufactured by the Lobortas Classic Jewelry House, were presented. As the winner of the 2013\u20132014 Grand Prix Series, Hou Yifan was solemnly awarded the Small Cup during the official closing ceremony of the tournament.\nDuring September 13 to 21, she competed at the 18th European Club Cup held in Bilbao, Spain. Once again she was the top board for Cercle d'Echecs de Monte-Carlo winning the individual gold medal for her performance 5/6 (+4 =2, TPR 2749) while leading her team to a second-place finish.[148]\nWith the postponement of the Women's World Chess Championship 2014[149] she played in the Corsican Chess Circuit in October and won, beating Sergey Fedorchuk in the final.  This has been described as the most important tournament yet to be won by a female player other than Judit Polg\u00e1r.[150][151][152]\nFrom December 11 to 18, Hou played in the 2014 SportAccord World Mind Games held in Beijing, China. The Mind Games consists of separate tournaments in 3 disciplines: rapid, blitz and basque. In the rapid event, she placed second capturing the silver medal, losing only to Valentina Gunina, the eventual event winner. Her performance was 5/7 (+4 \u22121 = 3, rapid TPR 2672). She won the gold medal in the blitz event with a 22.5/30 score (+20 \u22125 = 5, TPR 2718). Especially noteworthy in her blitz tournament was her performance pushed her official blitz rating to 2704, making her the second female player to cross the 2700 barrier in any rating format. In the final basque system event, Hou took home another gold medal with an 8.5/10 score (+7 =3).[153]\nWhen Hou turned twenty one in 2015 she lost her junior status. She ended the year, and her junior playing career, as the reigning Women's World Chess Champion, the 2nd highest rated female player, the highest rated girl, the 4th highest rated junior and the 71st highest overall rated active player with a FIDE rating of 2673.[154]\nHou once again played in the 2015 edition of Tata Steel Chess Tournament held from January 15 to 25. She was the 12th seed out of 14 total participants in the Category 20 Master group and finished 11th with a 5/13 score(+1 \u22124 = 8, TPR 2670). While she performed approximately according to her rating, Hou had winning chances in a few of her games and even missed a drawing chance against world champion Magnus Carlsen after defending a difficult position as black for most of the game.\nShortly after, she returned to the scene of her greatest chess tournament triumph, the Gibraltar Chess Festival 2015 held from January 27 to February 4. Seeded 13th by rating, she placed joint 3rd\u201311th, 3rd by performance with a 7.5/10 score (+5 =5, TPR 2772) pushing her FIDE rating to 2686. She also won the 1st place prize for being the highest scoring female player. Her excellent performance in this event resulted in her rating surpassing Judit Polg\u00e1r's classic rating for the first time in the March 2015 FIDE rating list, ending Polg\u00e1r's 26 consecutive years reign as the top rated female player in the world.  For the first time since Maia Chiburdanidze in January 1989 a single individual was both the top rated woman player and the reigning Women's World Chess Champion.[155]\nShe played in the Hawaii Grandmaster Challenge 2015 in March, a two-day four player quadruple blitz and rapid round robin event. She began the first day with a 3.5/6 score before crushing her opponents the second day with five straight wins and a draw in the final game easily winning the event with a 9/12 score. Since this event conflicted with the Women's World Chess Championship 2015 she relinquished her title to Mariya Muzychuk at the conclusion of the Championship.[156]\nHou played in the Nakhchivan Open 2015 in from May 1 to the 11th. Seeded 3rd by rating, she finished in a nine-way tie for joint 4th\u201312th with a 6/9 score (+5 \u22122 =2, TPR 2581).[157]\nShe played in the 2015 edition of Dortmund Sparkassen Chess Meeting which ran from June 27 to July 5. With an average rating of 2724, it qualified as a Category 20 supertournament. Hou finished in joint 7th/8th with a 2.5/7 score (\u22122 =5, TPR 2629)[158]\nHou has been chosen as the first FIDE Presidential nominee for Chess World Cup 2015 held in Baku from September 10 to October 5. She made it past the first round of a World Cup for the first time in her career before losing in the second round 1.5\u20132.5 to Shakhriyar Mamedyarov after the 1st set of rapid tiebreaks. Her performance rating was 2685 for the event.[159]\nFrom October 2 to October 15, Hou competed in the 1st leg of the FIDE Women's Grand Prix 2015\u201316 held in Monte Carlo, Monaco. She started the event slowly, with a 2.5/4 score going into the first rest day.  This included a loss to rival Humpy Koneru before stringing together a streak of six wins, winning the tournament with one round to spare. Her final score was 9/11 (+8 \u22121 = 2, TPR 2766).[160]\nShe participated in an exhibition match against Parimarjan Negi  held in the Chess Club and Scholastic Center of Saint Louis from November 12 to the 15th. The four-day event showcased a different chess variant each day: Basque Chess, Rapid Chess960, Rapid Chess and Blitz Chess with each game played counting for 1 point in determining the winner. Hou easily won the match: 0\u20132 in Basque, 3.5\u20130.5 in Chess960, 3\u20131 in Rapid Chess, and 4.5\u20133.5 in Blitz with a total score of 11\u20137.[161]\nAs part of the joint Russian-Chinese Match of Friendship chess festival held from December 13 to 15 held in Shanghai, China, Hou participated in an exhibition match with the GM Evgeniy Najer the 2015 European Champion. Playing a series of rapid and blitz games, she won quite convincingly with a 9.5 to 4.5 score.[162]\nIn the last chess event of the year, the 2nd edition of the 2015 Qatar Masters Open held from December 19 to the 30th in Doha, Qatar, Hou was the 22nd highest rated player in the tournament but finished in 38th place with a 5.5/9 score (+3 \u22121 =5, TPR 2591). The result was still good enough to win the top women's prize by a full point.[163]\nFor the third time, Hou competed in the top group of the Tata Steel Chess Tournament held from January 15 to 31. This year she was seeded 13th out of 14 participants in this Category 20 event. She started strongly, going +1 in her first six games before faltering with four losses in the following five games. She placed 12th with a 5/13 score(+1 \u22124 = 8, TPR 2672).\nIn early February, Hou played and won in a four-game match against Cristobal Henriquez Villagra in Punta Arenas. Billed as a Bicontinental Chess Match, it was scheduled to be played in two locations, but due to inclement weather, they were unable to play in Antarctica. She won the match with a 2.5\u20131.5 score(+2 \u22121 =1, TPR 2584).\nQualifying for the Women's World Chess Championship 2016, in March, as the winner of the FIDE Women's Grand Prix 2013\u201314, she reclaimed the World Championship title from Mariya Muzychuk in Lviv, Ukraine with a 6\u20133 score (+3 =6, TPR 2685).\nFrom March 23\u201326 Hou played in a four player 3 round classical/3 round rapid robin tournament to determine the qualifier for the 4th edition of Norway Chess. She finished in 3rd place with a 1/3 score (\u22121 =2, TPR 2531) in the classical portion and 2/1 score (+2 \u22121, TPR 2716) in the rapid portion.\nIn May, Hou dropped out of the current Women's World Championship cycle, effectively relinquishing the crown. She explained her reasons in a Chessbase interview, mainly objecting to the format wherein the Women's World Champion is decided alternately by a knockout tournament and then a match. She also expressed her willingness to participate in the cycle if the format were amended to mirror that of the World Chess Championship.[164]\nShe played in the Vugar Gashimov Memorial, a category 20 tournament held in, Shamkir Azerbaijan, from May 26 to June 4.  She was the ninth seed out of ten participants and finished in last place with a 2.5/10 score (\u22124 = 5, TPR 2578)\nHou played in the Eurasian Blitz Cup from June 17\u201320 in Almaty, Kazakhstan. Seeded 17th on the strength of her 2704 blitz rating, she came in 29th place with a 12.5/22 score (+10 \u22127 = 5, TPR 2650).  Among the female competitors, while having a superior performance rating, she came in second to Harika Dronavalli on tiebreaks.\nAt the Tradewise Gibraltar Chess Festival, Hou finished with a score of 6/10 (the tournament was won by Hikaru Nakamura). Her round 7 win against the French master Borya Ider, in which she made an early positional sacrifice of queen for two minor pieces, was described as \"truly astonishing\" by organizer and chess journalist John Saunders.[165] In the final round, she appeared to throw her game against Indian Grandmaster Lalith Babu, playing a ridiculous opening and resigning after 5 moves. She later explained that she was upset about being paired against other female players in 7 of her 9 previous games of a Swiss system tournament, despite men far outnumbering women at the tournament.[166][167] However tournament organizer Brian Callaghan said the pairings were simply the result of a computer program.[168]\nHou Yifan was one of 24 players selected to play in the FIDE Grand Prix 2017, a qualification stage for the World Chess Championship 2018. She reached position 17 in the final standings, and thus was not able to qualify for the Championship.\nShe declined to defend her title at the Women's World Chess Championship 2017, and as a result forfeited her title.[169]\nIn April she participated at the Grenke Classic at Baden-Baden. She finished 5th out of eight players, beating Fabiano Caruana and drawing against Magnus Carlsen after having come close to winning.[170]\nIn June she re-entered the top 100 players, as world no. 85.\nIn August, she was clear first at the Category 16 50th Biel Chess Festival with 6.5/9 points (+5 \u22121 =3, TPR 2810).[171]\nIn September she competed in the Chess World Cup 2017, where she went out in a second round tiebreak to Levon Aronian, the eventual winner.\nIn January she competed in the Tata Steel tournament in Wijk aan Zee as the only woman in the field of 14 players, placing last with a score of 2.5/13 (+0\u22128=5).\nFrom 31 March to 9 April, she participated in the 5th Grenke Chess Classic. She finished equal 8th\u20139th out of ten with a score of 3\u00bd/9 (+0 \u20132 =7).[172]\nIn December, she won the 2019 Belt and Road World Chess Woman Summit with 5/7 points.[173]\nRated 2686 in the March 2015 FIDE rating list, Hou was the world no. 59 player and world no. 1 woman player (overtaking the recently retired Judit Polg\u00e1r's rating for the first time).  On 1 July 2006, she was the youngest ever player to enter the Top 50 Women (Number 8)[174] and Top 20 Girls (Number 2)[175] FIDE lists aged 12 (rated 2488), since FIDE began releasing these lists in 2000.\nBetween the April 2006 and July 2006 FIDE rating lists, she gained an impressive 190 rating points from a rating of 2298 to a rating of 2488,[176] which made her the eighth highest rated female player, and the second highest rated girl, in the world.\nFour-time winner of the honorary Caissa Cup[177] as the best female player of the year (2010, 2011, 2013, 2014). Chess Award of Caissa, designed and executed by artisans of the Lobortas Classic Jewelry House,[178] was solemnly presented at the 40th Chess Olympiad in Istanbul on September 2, 2012, during a meeting of the Commission for Women's Chess with the participation of Susan Polgar chairing the commission.\nHou Yifan primarily plays 1.e4 as White. As Black, she usually plays the Sicilian Defence (including the Najdorf and Dragon variations) as well as the French Defence against 1.e4, while against 1.d4 she plays the Nimzo-Indian, Bogo-Indian and Queen's Indian defences.[179][180]\nOn 25 January 2008, Hou as Black beat GM Gabriel Sargissian (2676) of Armenia, longtime second of Levon Aronian, in the Corus (Group B) tournament, Wijk aan Zee, Netherlands:\nYifan claimed that there are many reasons for the lack of female contenders at the chess top-level. She says there is a physical aspect to long chess games that might advantage men, and that men generally work harder at chess than women growing up. She uses Chinese girls as an example and points out that most prefer a balanced life, prioritizing things such as university and family life at the cost of working on chess. But she claims there also are external factors: girls playing chess growing up are only encouraged to compete for the girl's title, which might lower their motivation.[181]", "links":

Championship - Wikipedia": {"text": "Pre-FIDE\nFIDE:\nSplit titles (Classical):\nSplit titles (FIDE):\nReunified (FIDE):\nThe World Chess Championship is played to determine the world champion in chess. The current world champion is Magnus Carlsen of Norway, since he defeated Viswanathan Anand in 2013.[1] In 2022, he announced that he would not defend his title a fifth time, and so the 2023 championship is being played between the top two finishers of the qualifying 2022 Candidates Tournament instead: Ian Nepomniachtchi of Russia and Ding Liren of China.\nThe first event recognized as a world championship was the 1886 match between the two leading players in the world, Wilhelm Steinitz and Johannes Zukertort. Steinitz won, becoming the first world champion. From 1886 to 1946, the champion set the terms, requiring any challenger to raise a sizable stake and defeat the champion in a match in order to become the new world champion. Following the death of reigning world champion Alexander Alekhine in 1946, FIDE (the International Chess Federation) took over administration of the World Championship, beginning with the 1948 World Championship tournament. From 1948 to 1993, FIDE organized a set of tournaments to choose a new challenger every three years. In 1993, reigning champion Garry Kasparov broke away from FIDE, which led to a rival claimant to the title of World Champion for the next thirteen years. The titles were unified at the World Chess Championship 2006, and all subsequent matches have once again been administered by FIDE.\nSince 2014, the championship has settled on a two-year cycle, although the 2020 and 2022 matches were postponed to 2021 and 2023 respectively because of the COVID-19 pandemic.[2]\nThough the world championship is open to all human players, there are separate championships for women, under-20s and lower age groups, and seniors; as well as one for computers. There are also chess world championships in rapid, blitz, correspondence, problem solving, and Fischer Random Chess.\nBefore Steinitz and Zukertort, no chess player seriously claimed to be champion of the world, although the phrase was used by some chess writers to describe other players of their day.[3] A series of players regarded as the strongest (or at least the most famous) in the world extends back hundreds of years. They include Ruy L\u00f3pez de Segura around 1560, Paolo Boi and Leonardo da Cutri around 1575, Alessandro Salvio around 1600, and Gioachino Greco around 1623. In the 18th and early 19th centuries, French players dominated, with Legall de Kermeur (1730\u20131755), Fran\u00e7ois-Andr\u00e9 Danican Philidor (1755\u20131795), Alexandre Deschapelles (around 1800\u20131821) and Louis-Charles Mah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais (1821\u20131840) all widely regarded as the strongest players of their time.[citation needed]\nSomething resembling a world championship match was the La Bourdonnais \u2013 McDonnell chess matches in 1834, in which La Bourdonnais played a series of six matches \u2013 and 85 games \u2013 against the Irishman Alexander McDonnell, with La Bourdonnais winning a majority of the games.[citation needed]\nThe idea of a chess world champion goes back at least to 1840, when a columnist in Fraser's Magazine wrote, \"Will Gaul continue the dynasty by placing a fourth Frenchman on the throne of the world? the three last chess chiefs having been successively Philidor, Deschapelles, and De La Bourdonnais.\"[4][5]\nAfter La Bourdonnais' death in December 1840,[6] Englishman Howard Staunton's match victory over another Frenchman, Pierre Charles Fournier de Saint-Amant, in 1843 is considered to have established Staunton as the world's strongest player.[7][4] The earliest recorded use of the term \"World Champion\" was in 1845, when Staunton was described as \"the Chess Champion of England, or\u00a0... the Champion of the World\".[8]\nAn important milestone was the London 1851 chess tournament, which was the first international chess tournament, organized by Staunton. It was played as a series of matches, and was won convincingly by the German Adolf Anderssen, including a 4\u20131 semi-final win over Staunton, establishing Anderssen as the world's leading player.[9] However, there is no evidence that he was widely acclaimed at the time as the world champion, and there is no mention afterwards in the tournament book by Staunton,[10] although in 1893, Henry Bird retrospectively awarded the title of first world chess champion to Anderssen for his victory.[11]\nAnderssen was himself decisively defeated in an 1858 match against the American Paul Morphy (7\u20132, 2 draws). In 1858\u201359 Morphy played matches against several leading players, crushing them all,[12][13] and he was widely hailed as the world champion.[14] But when Morphy returned to America in 1859, he abruptly retired from chess, though many considered him the world champion until his death in 1884. His sudden withdrawal from chess at his peak led to his being known as \"the pride and sorrow of chess\".[15]\nAfter Morphy's retirement from chess, Anderssen was again regarded as the world's strongest active player,[16] a reputation he reinforced by winning the strong London 1862 chess tournament.[16]\nIn 1866, Wilhelm Steinitz narrowly defeated Anderssen in a match (8\u20136, 0 draws). Steinitz confirmed his standing as the world's leading player by winning a match against Johannes Zukertort in 1872 (7\u20131, 4 draws), winning the Vienna 1873 chess tournament, and winning a match over Joseph Henry Blackburne by a crushing 7\u20130 (0 draws) in 1876.[17]\nHowever, apart from the Blackburne match, Steinitz played no competitive chess between the Vienna tournaments of 1873 and 1882. During that time, Zukertort emerged as the world's leading active player, winning the Paris 1878 chess tournament. Zukertort then won the London 1883 chess tournament by a convincing 3-point margin, ahead of nearly every leading player in the world, with Steinitz finishing second.[18][19] This tournament established Steinitz and Zukertort as the best two players in the world, and led to a match between these two, the World Chess Championship 1886,[19][20] won by Steinitz.\nThere is some debate over whether to date Steinitz's reign as world champion from his win over Anderssen in 1866, or from his win over Zukertort in 1886. The 1886 match was clearly agreed to be for the world championship,[21][14] but there is no indication that Steinitz was regarded as the defending champion.[22] There is also no known evidence of Steinitz being called the world champion after defeating Anderssen in 1866.[14] It has been suggested that Steinitz could not make such a claim while Morphy was alive[23] (Morphy died in 1884). There are a number of references to Steinitz as world champion in the 1870s, the earliest being after the first Zukertort match in 1872.[14] Later, in 1879, it was argued that Zukertort was world champion, since Morphy and Steinitz were not active.[14] However, later in his career, at least from 1887, Steinitz dated his reign from this 1866 match,[14] and early sources such as the New York Times in 1894,[24] and Emanuel Lasker in 1908,[14] and Reuben Fine in 1952[25] all do the same.\nMany modern commentators divide Steinitz's reign into an \"unofficial\" one from 1866 to 1886, and an \"official\" one after 1886.[26][27][28] By this reckoning, the first World Championship match was in 1886, and Steinitz was the first official World Chess Champion.[29]\nFollowing the Steinitz\u2013Zukertort match, a tradition continued of the world championship being decided by a match between the reigning champion, and a challenger: if a player thought he was strong enough, he (or his friends) would find financial backing for a match purse and challenge the reigning world champion. If he won, he would become the new champion.\nSteinitz successfully defended his world title against Mikhail Chigorin in 1889, Isidor Gunsberg in 1891, and Chigorin again in 1892.\nIn 1887, the American Chess Congress started work on drawing up regulations for the future conduct of world championship contests. Steinitz supported this endeavor, as he thought he was becoming too old to remain world champion. The proposal evolved through many forms (as Steinitz pointed out, such a project had never been undertaken before), and resulted in the 1889 tournament in New York to select a challenger for Steinitz[citation needed], rather like the more recent Candidates Tournaments. The tournament was duly played, but the outcome was not quite as planned: Chigorin and Max Weiss tied for first place; their play-off resulted in four draws; and neither wanted to play a match against Steinitz \u2013 Chigorin had just lost to him, and Weiss wanted to get back to his work for the Rothschild Bank. The third prizewinner, Isidor Gunsberg, was prepared to play Steinitz for the title in New York, so this match was played in 1890\u20131891 and was won by Steinitz.[30][31][32] The experiment was not repeated, and Steinitz's later matches were private arrangements between the players.[24]\nTwo young strong players emerged in late 1880s and early 1890s: Siegbert Tarrasch and Emanuel Lasker.[33] Tarrasch had the better tournament results at the time, but it was Lasker who was able to raise the money to challenge Steinitz.[33] Lasker won the 1894 match and succeeded Steinitz as world champion.\nLasker held the title from 1894 to 1921, the longest reign (27 years) of any champion. He won a return match against Steinitz in 1897, and then did not defend his title for ten years, before playing four title defences in four years. He comfortably defeated Frank Marshall in 1907 and Siegbert Tarrasch in 1908. In 1910, he almost lost his title in a short tied match against Carl Schlechter, although the exact conditions of this match are a mystery. He then defeated Dawid Janowski in the most one-sided title match in history later in 1910.\nLasker's negotiations for title matches from 1911 onwards were extremely controversial. In 1911 he received a challenge for a world title match against Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca and, in addition to making severe financial demands, proposed some novel conditions: the match should be considered drawn if neither player finished with a two-game lead; and it should have a maximum of 30 games, but finish if either player won six games and had a two-game lead (previous matches had been won by the first to win a certain number of games, usually 10; in theory, such a match might go on for ever). Capablanca objected to the two-game lead clause; Lasker took offence at the terms in which Capablanca criticized the two-game lead condition and broke off negotiations.[34]\nFurther controversy arose when, in 1912, Lasker's terms for a proposed match with Akiba Rubinstein included a clause that, if Lasker should resign the title after a date had been set for the match, Rubinstein should become world champion.[35] When he resumed negotiations with Capablanca after World War I, Lasker insisted on a similar clause that if Lasker should resign the title after a date had been set for the match, Capablanca should become world champion.[34] On 27 June 1920 Lasker abdicated in favor of Capablanca because of public criticism of the terms of the match, naming Capablanca as his successor.[35] Some commentators questioned Lasker's right to name his successor;[35] Amos Burn raised the same objection but welcomed Lasker's resignation of the title.[35] Capablanca argued that, if the champion abdicated, the title must go to the challenger, as any other arrangement would be unfair to the challenger.[35] Lasker later agreed to play a match against Capablanca in 1921, announcing that, if he won, he would resign the title so that younger masters could compete for it.[35] Capablanca won their 1921 match by four wins, ten draws and no losses.[25]\nAfter the breakdown of his first attempt to negotiate a title match against Lasker (1911), Capablanca drafted rules for the conduct of future challenges, which were agreed to by the other top players at the 1914 Saint Petersburg tournament, including Lasker, and approved at the Mannheim Congress later that year. The main points were: the champion must be prepared to defend his title once a year; the match should be won by the first player to win six or eight games (the champion had the right to choose); and the stake should be at least \u00a31,000 (about \u00a3100,000 in current terms).[34]\nFollowing the controversies surrounding his 1921 match against Lasker, in 1922 world champion Capablanca proposed the \"London Rules\": the first player to win six games would win the match; playing sessions would be limited to 5 hours; the time limit would be 40 moves in 2\u00bd hours; the champion must defend his title within one year of receiving a challenge from a recognized master; the champion would decide the date of the match; the champion was not obliged to accept a challenge for a purse of less than US$10,000 (about $150,000 in current terms); 20% of the purse was to be paid to the title holder, and the remainder being divided, 60% going to the winner of the match, and 40% to the loser; the highest purse bid must be accepted. Alekhine, Bogoljubow, Mar\u00f3czy, R\u00e9ti, Rubinstein, Tartakower and Vidmar promptly signed them.[36]\nThe only match played under those rules was Capablanca vs Alekhine in 1927, although there has been speculation that the actual contract might have included a \"two-game lead\" clause.[37] Alekhine, Rubinstein and Nimzowitsch had all challenged Capablanca in the early 1920s but only Alekhine could raise the US$10,000 Capablanca demanded and only in 1927.[38] Capablanca was shockingly upset by the new challenger. Before the match, almost nobody gave Alekhine a chance against the dominant Cuban, but Alekhine overcame Capablanca's natural skill with his unmatched drive and extensive preparation (especially deep opening analysis, which became a hallmark of most future grandmasters). The aggressive Alekhine was helped by his tactical skill, which complicated the game.\nImmediately after winning, Alekhine announced that he was willing to grant Capablanca a return match provided Capablanca met the requirements of the \"London Rules\".[37] Negotiations dragged on for several years, often breaking down when agreement seemed in sight.[25] Alekhine easily won two title matches against Efim Bogoljubov in 1929 and 1934.\nIn 1935, Alekhine was unexpectedly defeated by the Dutch Max Euwe, an amateur player who worked as a mathematics teacher. Alekhine convincingly won a rematch in 1937. World War II temporarily prevented any further world title matches, and Alekhine remained world champion until his death in 1946.\nBefore 1948 world championship matches were financed by arrangements similar to those Emanuel Lasker described for his 1894 match with Wilhelm Steinitz: either the challenger or both players, with the assistance of financial backers, would contribute to a purse; about half would be distributed to the winner's backers, and the winner would receive the larger share of the remainder (the loser's backers got nothing). The players had to meet their own travel, accommodation, food and other expenses out of their shares of the purse.[39] This system evolved out of the wagering of small stakes on club games in the early 19th century.[40]\nUp to and including the 1894 Steinitz\u2013Lasker match, both players, with their backers, generally contributed equally to the purse, following the custom of important matches in the 19th century before there was a generally recognized world champion. For example: the stakes were \u00a3100 a side in both the second Staunton vs Saint-Amant match (Paris, 1843) and the Anderssen vs Steinitz match (London, 1866); Steinitz and Zukertort played their 1886 match for \u00a3400 a side.[40] Lasker introduced the practice of demanding that the challenger should provide the whole of the purse,[citation needed] and his successors followed his example up to World War II. This requirement made arranging world championship matches more difficult, for example: Marshall challenged Lasker in 1904 but could not raise the money until 1907;[41] in 1911 Lasker and Rubinstein agreed in principle to a world championship match, but this was never played as Rubinstein could not raise the money.[42][43] In the early 1920s, Alekhine, Rubinstein and Nimzowitsch all challenged Capablanca, but only Alekhine was able to raise the US$10,000 that Capablanca demanded, and not until 1927.[38][44]\nAttempts to form an international chess federation were made at the time of the 1914 St. Petersburg, 1914 Mannheim and 1920 Gothenburg Tournaments.[45] On 20 July 1924 the participants at the Paris tournament founded FIDE as a kind of players' union.[45][46][47]\nFIDE's congresses in 1925 and 1926 expressed a desire to become involved in managing the world championship. FIDE was largely happy with the \"London Rules\", but claimed that the requirement for a purse of $10,000 was impracticable and called upon Capablanca to come to an agreement with the leading masters to revise the Rules. In 1926 FIDE decided in principle to create a title of \"Champion of FIDE\" and, in 1928, adopted the forthcoming 1928 Bogoljubow\u2013Euwe match (won by Bogoljubow) as being for the \"FIDE championship\". Alekhine agreed to place future matches for the world title under the auspices of FIDE, except that he would only play Capablanca under the same conditions that governed their match in 1927. Although FIDE wished to set up a match between Alekhine and Bogoljubow, it made little progress and the title \"Champion of FIDE\" quietly vanished after Alekhine won the 1929 world championship match that he and Bogoljubow themselves arranged.[48]\nWhile negotiating his 1937 World Championship rematch with Alekhine, Euwe proposed that if he retained the title FIDE should manage the nomination of future challengers and the conduct of championship matches. FIDE had been trying since 1935 to introduce rules on how to select challengers, and its various proposals favored selection by some sort of committee. While they were debating procedures in 1937 and Alekhine and Euwe were preparing for their rematch later that year, the Royal Dutch Chess Federation proposed that a super-tournament (AVRO) of ex-champions and rising stars should be held to select the next challenger. FIDE rejected this proposal and at their second attempt nominated Salo Flohr as the official challenger. Euwe then declared that: if he retained his title against Alekhine he was prepared to meet Flohr in 1940 but he reserved the right to arrange a title match either in 1938 or 1939 with Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca, who had lost the title to Alekhine in 1927; if Euwe lost his title to Capablanca then FIDE's decision should be followed and Capablanca would have to play Flohr in 1940. Most chess writers and players strongly supported the Dutch super-tournament proposal and opposed the committee processes favored by FIDE. While this confusion went unresolved: Euwe lost his title to Alekhine; the AVRO tournament in 1938 was won by Paul Keres under a tie-breaking rule, with Reuben Fine placed second and Capablanca and Flohr in the bottom places; and the outbreak of World War II in 1939 cut short the controversy.[49]\nBefore 1946 a new World Champion had won the title by defeating the former champion in a match. Alexander Alekhine's death in 1946 created an interregnum that made the normal procedure impossible. The situation was very confused, with many respected players and commentators offering different solutions. FIDE found it very difficult to organize the early discussions on how to resolve the interregnum because problems with money and travel so soon after the end of World War II prevented many countries from sending representatives. The shortage of clear information resulted in otherwise responsible magazines publishing rumors and speculation, which only made the situation more confusing.[50]\nIt did not help that the Soviet Union had long refused to join FIDE, and by this time it was clear that about half the credible contenders were Soviet citizens. But, realizing that it could not afford to be excluded from discussions about the vacant world championship, the Soviet Union sent a telegram in 1947 apologizing for the absence of Soviet representatives and requesting that the USSR be represented on future FIDE Committees.[50]\nThe eventual solution was very similar to FIDE's initial proposal and to a proposal put forward by the Soviet Union (authored by Mikhail Botvinnik). The 1938 AVRO tournament was used as the basis for the 1948 Championship Tournament. The AVRO tournament had brought together the eight players who were, by general acclamation, the best players in the world at the time. Two of the participants at AVRO \u2013 Alekhine and former world champion Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca \u2013 had died; but FIDE decided that the championship should be awarded to the winner of a round-robin tournament in which the other six participants at AVRO would play four games against each other. These players were: Max Euwe, from the Netherlands; Botvinnik, Paul Keres and Salo Flohr from the Soviet Union; and Reuben Fine and Samuel Reshevsky from the United States. However, FIDE soon accepted a Soviet request to substitute Vasily Smyslov for Flohr, and Fine dropped out in order to continue his degree studies in psychology, so only five players competed. Botvinnik won convincingly and thus became world champion, ending the interregnum.[50]\nThe proposals which led to the 1948 Championship Tournament also specified the procedure by which challengers for the World Championship would be selected in a three-year cycle: countries affiliated to FIDE would send players to Zonal Tournaments (the number varied depending on how many good enough players each country had); the players who gained the top places in these would compete in an Interzonal Tournament (later split into two and then three tournaments as the number of countries and eligible players increased[51]); the highest-placed players from the Interzonal would compete in the Candidates Tournament, along with whoever lost the previous title match and the second-placed competitor in the previous Candidates Tournament three years earlier; and the winner of the Candidates played a title match against the champion.[50] Until 1962 inclusive the Candidates Tournament was a multi-cycle round-robin tournament \u2013 how and why it was changed are described below.\nThe FIDE system followed its 1948 design through five cycles: 1948\u20131951, 1951\u20131954, 1954\u20131957, 1957\u20131960 and 1960\u20131963.[52][53] The first two world championships under this system were drawn 12\u201312 \u2013 Botvinnik-Bronstein in 1951 and Botvinnik-Smyslov in 1954 \u2013 so Botvinnik retained the title both times.\nIn 1956 FIDE introduced two apparently minor changes which Soviet grandmaster and chess official Yuri Averbakh alleged were instigated by the two Soviet representatives in FIDE, who were personal friends of reigning champion Mikhail Botvinnik. A defeated champion would have the right to a return match. FIDE also limited the number of players from the same country that could compete in the Candidates Tournament, on the grounds that it would reduce Soviet dominance of the tournament. Averbakh claimed that this was to Botvinnik's advantage as it reduced the number of Soviet players he might have to meet in the title match.[54] Botvinnik lost to Vasily Smyslov in 1957 but won the return match in 1958, and lost to Mikhail Tal in 1960 but won the return match in 1961. Thus Smyslov and Tal each held the world title for a year, but Botvinnik was world champion for rest of the time from 1948 to 1963.\nThe return match clause was not in place for the 1963 cycle. Tigran Petrosian won the 1962 Candidates and then defeated Botvinnik in 1963 to become world champion.\nAfter the 1962 Candidates, Bobby Fischer publicly alleged that the Soviets had colluded to prevent any non-Soviet \u2013 specifically him \u2013 from winning. He claimed that Petrosian, Efim Geller and Paul Keres had prearranged to draw all their games, and that Viktor Korchnoi had been instructed to lose to them. Yuri Averbakh, who was head of the Soviet team, confirmed in 2002 that Petrosian, Geller and Keres arranged to draw all their games in order to save their energy for games against non-Soviet players.[54] Korchnoi, who defected from the USSR in 1976, has never confirmed that he was forced to throw games. FIDE responded by changing the format of future Candidates Tournaments to eliminate the possibility of collusion.\nBeginning in the next cycle, 1963\u20131966, the round-robin tournament was replaced by a series of elimination matches. Initially the quarter-finals and semi-finals were best of 10 games, and the final was best of 12. Fischer, however, refused to take part in the 1966 cycle, and dropped out of the 1969 cycle after a controversy at 1967 Interzonal in Sousse.[55] Both these Candidates cycles were won by Boris Spassky, who lost the title match to Petrosian in 1966, but won and became world champion in 1969.[56][57]\nIn the 1969\u20131972 cycle Fischer caused two more crises. He refused to play in the 1969 US Championship, which was a Zonal Tournament. This would have eliminated him from the 1969\u20131972 cycle, but Benko was persuaded to concede his place in the Interzonal to Fischer.[58] FIDE President Max Euwe accepted this maneuver and interpreted the rules very flexibly to enable Fischer to play, as he thought it important for the health and reputation of the game that Fischer should have the opportunity to challenge for the title as soon as possible.[59] Fischer crushed all opposition and won the right to challenge reigning champion Boris Spassky.[56] After agreeing to play in Yugoslavia, Fischer raised a series of objections and Iceland was the final venue. Even then Fischer raised difficulties, mainly over money. It took a phone call from United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and a doubling of the prize money by financier Jim Slater to persuade him to play. After a few more traumatic moments Fischer won the match 12\u00bd\u20138\u00bd.[60][61]\nAn unbroken line of FIDE champions had thus been established from 1948 to 1972, with each champion gaining his title by beating the previous incumbent. This came to an end when Anatoly Karpov won the right to challenge Fischer in 1975. Fischer objected to the \"best of 24 games\" championship match format that had been used from 1951 onwards, claiming that it would encourage whoever got an early lead to play for draws. Instead he demanded that the match should be won by whoever first won 10 games, except that if the score reached 9\u20139 he should remain champion. He argued that this was more advantageous to the challenger than the champion's advantage under the existing system, where the champion retained the title if the match was tied at 12\u201312 including draws. Eventually FIDE deposed Fischer and crowned Karpov as the new champion.[62]\nFischer privately maintained that he was still World Champion. He went into seclusion and did not play chess in public again until 1992, when Spassky agreed to participate in an unofficial rematch for the World Championship. Fischer won the 1992 Fischer\u2013Spassky rematch decisively with a score of 10\u20135.\nAfter becoming world champion by default, Karpov confirmed his worthiness for the title with a string of tournament successes from the mid 70s to the early 80s. He defended his title twice against ex-Soviet Viktor Korchnoi, first in Baguio, the Philippines, in 1978 (6\u20135 with 21 draws) then in Merano in 1981 (6\u20132, with 10 draws).\nHe eventually lost his title in 1985 to Garry Kasparov, whose aggressive tactical style was in sharp contrast to Karpov's positional style. The two of them fought five incredibly close world championship matches, the World Chess Championship 1984 (controversially terminated without result with Karpov leading +5 \u22123 =40), World Chess Championship 1985 (in which Kasparov won the title, 13\u201311), World Chess Championship 1986 (narrowly won by Kasparov, 12\u00bd\u201311\u00bd), World Chess Championship 1987 (drawn 12\u201312, Kasparov retaining the title), and World Chess Championship 1990 (again narrowly won by Kasparov, 12\u00bd\u201311\u00bd).\nIn the five matches Kasparov and Karpov played 144 games with 104 draws, 21 wins by Kasparov and 19 wins by Karpov.\nIn 1993, Nigel Short broke the domination of Kasparov and Karpov by defeating Karpov in the candidates semi-finals followed by Jan Timman in the finals, thereby earning the right to challenge Kasparov for the title. However, before the match took place, both Kasparov and Short complained of corruption and a lack of professionalism within FIDE in organizing the match, and split from FIDE to set up the Professional Chess Association (PCA), under whose auspices they held their match. In response, FIDE stripped Kasparov of his title and held a championship match between Karpov and Timman. For the first time in history, there were two World Chess Champions: Kasparov defeated Short and Karpov beat Timman.\nFIDE and the PCA each held a championship cycle in 1993\u20131996, with many of the same challengers playing in both. Kasparov and Karpov both won their respective cycles. In the PCA cycle, Kasparov defeated Viswanathan Anand in the PCA World Chess Championship 1995. Karpov defeated Gata Kamsky in the final of the FIDE World Chess Championship 1996. Negotiations were held for a reunification match between Kasparov and Karpov in 1996\u201397,[64] but nothing came of them.[65]\nSoon after the 1995 championship, the PCA folded, and Kasparov had no organisation to choose his next challenger. In 1998 he formed the World Chess Council, which organised a candidates match between Alexei Shirov and Vladimir Kramnik. Shirov won the match, but negotiations for a Kasparov\u2013Shirov match broke down, and Shirov was subsequently omitted from negotiations, much to his disgust. Plans for a 1999 or 2000 Kasparov\u2013Anand match also broke down, and Kasparov organised a match with Kramnik in late 2000. In a major upset, Kramnik won the match with two wins, thirteen draws, and no losses. At the time the championship was called the Braingames World Chess Championship, but Kramnik later referred to himself as the Classical World Chess Champion.\nMeanwhile, FIDE had decided to scrap the Interzonal and Candidates system, instead having a large knockout event in which a large number of players contested short matches against each other over just a few weeks (see FIDE World Chess Championship 1998). Rapid and blitz games were used to resolve ties at the end of each round, a format which some felt did not necessarily recognize the highest quality play: Kasparov refused to participate in these events, as did Kramnik after he won the Classical title in 2000. In the first of these events, in 1998, champion Karpov was seeded directly into the final, but he later had to qualify alongside the other players. Karpov defended his title in the first of these championships in 1998, but resigned his title in protest at the new rules in 1999. Alexander Khalifman won the FIDE World Championship in 1999, Anand in 2000, Ruslan Ponomariov in 2002, and Rustam Kasimdzhanov in 2004.\nBy 2002, not only were there two rival champions, but Kasparov's strong results \u2013 he had the top Elo rating in the world and had won a string of major tournaments after losing his title in 2000 \u2013 ensured even more confusion over who was World Champion. In May 2002, American grandmaster Yasser Seirawan led the organisation of the so-called \"Prague Agreement\" to reunite the world championship. Kramnik had organised a candidates tournament (won later in 2002 by Peter Leko) to choose his challenger. It was agreed that Kasparov would play the FIDE champion (Ponomariov) for the FIDE title, and the winner of that match would face the winner of the Kramnik\u2013Leko match for the unified title. However, the matches proved difficult to finance and organise. The Kramnik\u2013Leko match did not take place until late 2004 (it was drawn, so Kramnik retained his title). Meanwhile, FIDE never managed to organise a Kasparov match, either with 2002 FIDE champion Ponomariov, or 2004 FIDE champion Kasimdzhanov. Kasparov's frustration at the situation played a part in his decision to retire from chess in 2005, still ranked No. 1 in the world.\nSoon after, FIDE dropped the short knockout format for a World Championship and announced the FIDE World Chess Championship 2005, a double round robin tournament to be held in San Luis, Argentina between eight of the leading players in the world. However Kramnik insisted that his title be decided in a match, and declined to participate. The tournament was convincingly won by the Bulgarian Veselin Topalov, and negotiations began for a Kramnik\u2013Topalov match to unify the title.\nThe World Chess Championship 2006 reunification match between Topalov and Kramnik was held in late 2006. After much controversy, it was won by Kramnik. Kramnik thus became the first unified and undisputed World Chess Champion since Kasparov split from FIDE to form the PCA in 1993. This match, and all subsequent championships, have been administered by FIDE.\nKramnik played to defend his title at the World Chess Championship 2007 in Mexico. This was an 8-player double round robin tournament, the same format as was used for the FIDE World Chess Championship 2005. This tournament was won by Viswanathan Anand, thus making him the World Chess Champion. Because Anand's World Chess Champion title was won in a tournament rather than a match, a minority of commentators questioned the validity of his title.[66] Kramnik also made ambiguous comments about the value of Anand's title, but did not claim the title himself.[67] Subsequent world championship matches returned to the format of a match between the champion and a challenger.\nThe following two championships had special clauses arising from the 2006 unification. Kramnik was given the right to challenge for the title he lost in a tournament in the World Chess Championship 2008, which Anand won. Then Topalov, who as the loser of the 2006 match was excluded from the 2007 championship, was seeded directly into the Candidates final of the World Chess Championship 2010. He won the Candidates (against Gata Kamsky). Anand again won the championship match.[68][69]\nThe next championship, the World Chess Championship 2012, had short knock-out matches for the Candidates Tournament. This format was not popular with everyone, and world No. 1 Magnus Carlsen withdrew in protest. Boris Gelfand won the Candidates. Anand won the championship match again, in tie breaking rapid games, for his fourth consecutive world championship win.[70]\nSince 2013, the Candidates Tournament has been an 8-player double round robin tournament, with the winner playing a match against the champion for the title. The Norwegian Magnus Carlsen won the 2013 Candidates and then convincingly defeated Anand in the World Chess Championship 2013.[71][72]\nBeginning with the 2014 Championship cycle, the World Championship has followed a 2-year cycle: qualification for the Candidates in the odd year, the Candidates tournament early in the even year, and the World Championship match later in the even year. This and the next two cycles resulted in Carlsen successfully defending his title: against Anand in 2014;[73] against Sergey Karjakin in 2016;[74] and against Fabiano Caruana in 2018. Both the 2016 and 2018 defences were decided by tie-break in rapid games.[75]\nThe COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the 2020 Candidates Tournament, and caused the next match to be postponed from 2020 to 2021.[76] Carlsen again successfully defended his title, defeating Ian Nepomniachtchi in the World Chess Championship 2021.\nSoon after the 2021 match, Carlsen indicated that he would not defend the title again.[77] This was confirmed in an announcement by FIDE on 20 July 2022.[78] As a consequence, the top two finishers of the Candidates Tournament, Ian Nepomniachtchi and Ding Liren, are currently playing in the 2023 championship in Astana, Kazakhstan, from 7 April to 1 May 2023.[79]\nUntil 1948, world championship contests were arranged privately between the players. As a result, the players also had to arrange the funding, in the form of stakes provided by enthusiasts who wished to bet on one of the players. In the early 20th century this was sometimes an obstacle that prevented or delayed challenges for the title. Between 1888 and 1948 various difficulties that arose in match negotiations led players to try to define agreed rules for matches, including the frequency of matches, how much or how little say the champion had in the conditions for a title match and what the stakes and division of the purse should be. However these attempts were unsuccessful in practice, as the same issues continued to delay or prevent challenges. There was an attempt by an external organization to manage the world championship from 1887\u20131889, but this experiment was not repeated until 1948.\nAfter the death of world champion Alexander Alekhine in 1946, the World Chess Championship 1948 was a one-off tournament to decide a new world champion.\nSince 1948, the world championship has mainly operated on a two or three-year cycle, with four stages:\nThere have been a few exceptions to this system:\n[80]\n[81]\nThe table below organises the world champions in order of championship wins. A successful defense counts as a win for the purposes of this table, even if the match is drawn. The table is made more complicated by the split between the \"Classical\" (PCA) and FIDE world titles between 1993 and 2006.\nRestricted events:\nOther time limits:\nTeams:\nComputer chess:\nChess

Wikipedia": {"text": "This article is about the participation of women in chess and its culture.\nThe majority of chess tournaments are open to all participants regardless of gender. Very few, if any, international tournaments are restricted to men, but a few are restricted to women, most prominently the Women's World Chess Championship and the Women's Chess Olympiad. The World Junior Chess Championship and World Youth Chess Championship also include concurrent girls' championships in various age divisions. Many countries hold, in addition to the national championship, a separate women's national championship.\nThe first Women's World Chess Championship was held in 1927 and won by Vera Menchik.[1] The current champion is Ju Wenjun; the higher rated Hou Yifan, after winning the championship three times, has declined to participate since 2016.[2]\nIn 2010, as the head coach for the Texas Tech Knight Raiders chess team, Susan Polgar became the first woman to lead a men's Division I chess team to the Final Four.[3] In April 2011 the Texas Tech Knight Raiders won the President's Cup;[4] this made Polgar the first female head coach to lead a men's Division I chess team to the national title.[3]\nJudit Polg\u00e1r, generally considered the strongest female player of all time,[5] was at one time the eighth highest rated player in the world, and remains the only woman to have ever been rated in the world's top ten.[6][7] Three women, Maia Chiburdanidze,[8] Polg\u00e1r,[9] and Hou Yifan,[10] have been ranked in the world's top 100 players.[11]\nAnalysis of rating statistics of German players in an article from 2009 by Merim Bilali\u0107, Kieran Smallbone, Peter McLeod, and Fernand Gobet[12] indicated that although the highest-rated men were stronger than the highest-rated women, the difference (usually more than 200 rating points) was largely accounted for by the relatively smaller pool of women players (only one-sixteenth of rated German players were women). In 2020, psychologist and neuroscientist Wei Ji Ma summarized the state of research on women in chess as \"there is currently zero evidence for biological differences in chess ability between the genders\" but added \"that does not mean that there are certainly no such differences.\"[13]\nChess players, both men and women, have speculated on the reasons behind the gap in chess achievements by women compared to men. Some women players believe the major reason is due to cultural expectations and bias. Jennifer Shahade, a FIDE Woman Grandmaster and the women's program director at the United States Chess Federation (USCF), said there is a large drop-off of girls at the USCF around the ages of 12 and 13, which she attributes to the lack of a social network for girls that age in chess.[14] Polg\u00e1r said that society and some parents may weaken the desire of young female chess players to improve,[15] and that women were often held back by lower ambition by choosing to compete in all-women tournaments rather than open tournaments.[16] Jovanka Houska, an International Master and Woman Grandmaster, argued that overconfidence by boys gives an advantage over girls.[17]\nIn a 2007 study at the University of Padua, male and female players of similar ability were matched up with each other on online games. When the players were unaware of their opponent's sex, female players won slightly under half their games. When female players were told their opponent was male, they played less aggressively, and they won about one in four games. However, when female players were told their opponent was female, even though they were actually male, they were as aggressive as the male players and won about one in two games. The researchers argued that gender stereotypes may have led female players to lower their self-esteem and self-confidence when they know they are playing male players, causing them to play defensively which worsened their performance.[18][16]\nPolg\u00e1r,[15] Shahade[14] and Houska[17] said that they have encountered sexism, including belittling comments about their abilities, opponents who refused to shake hands, and online trolls questioning if girls and women belong in chess.\nSome male players have commented negatively on women's performance in chess. In a 1963 interview, Bobby Fischer was dismissive of female players, calling them \"terrible\" and said it was because \"[women] are not so smart\".[19] In 2015, Nigel Short argued that male players performed better because men and women were \"hard-wired\" for different skills,[20] which was met with controversy.[21] In 2022, Ilya Smirin, while broadcasting live during the ninth round of the FIDE Women's Grand Prix 2022-23, said that chess was \"maybe not for women\", and also praised a woman for playing like a man.[22] FIDE apologized through Twitter and called Smirin's comments embarrassing and offensive. The same day FIDE fired Smirin for making \"offensive remarks\".[23]\nMargret the Adroit may have made the 12th-century[24] Lewis chessmen. In 2010 at a conference at the National Museum of Scotland on the Lewis chessmen, Gudmundur Thorarinsson (a civil engineer and a former member of the Icelandic Parliament) and Einar S. Einarsson (a former president of Visa Iceland and a friend of the chess champion Bobby Fischer)[25][26] argued that Margret the Adroit made them. It is a claim that the American author Nancy Marie Brown supports in her 2015 book, Ivory Vikings, the Mystery of the Most Famous Chessmen in the World and the Woman Who Made Them.[27]\nCa\u00efssa (\"Ka-ee-sah\") is a fictional (anachronistic) Thracian dryad portrayed as the goddess of chess. She was first mentioned during the Renaissance by Italian poet Hieronymus Vida.\nHistorically chess has had many variants. In chess today the queen is the name of the most powerful chess piece. Historian Marilyn Yalom has argued that the queen was able to become the most dangerous piece on the board in the late 15th century because of the example of powerful female rulers in that era of European history.[28][29]\nIn the Middle Ages, Macalda di Scaletta played chess, and historical evidence suggests that she was probably the first person in Sicily who learned how to play it.\nQueen Elizabeth I, who lived from 1533 until 1603, played chess very well, according to a placard in the Tower of London.[30][31]\nBenjamin Franklin, who lived from 1706 until 1790, according to Thomas Jefferson played chess in Paris with socially important women, including the Duchess of Bourbon Bathilde d'Orl\u00e9ans, who was \"a chess player of about his force\".[32][33]\nIn 1884 the first women's chess tournament was held; it was sponsored by the Sussex Chess Association.[34] In 1897 the first women's international chess tournament was held, which Mary Rudge won.[35] In 1927 the first Women's World Chess Championship was held, which Vera Menchik won.[1]\nIn 1950 Lyudmila Rudenko became the first female International Master.[36][37]\nThe first Women's Chess Olympiad was held in 1957 and won by the Soviet Union team.[38][39][40][41]\nIn 1976 Rohini Khadilkar became the first female to compete in the Indian Men's Championship. Her involvement in a male competition caused a furore that necessitated a successful appeal to the High Court and caused the World Chess Federation president, Max Euwe, to rule that women cannot be barred from national and international championships.[42] In 1978 Nona Gaprindashvili became the first female Grandmaster.[43][44]\nIn 1996 Judit Polg\u00e1r became the first woman to be ranked in the top ten of all chess players,[45] in 2002 she became the first female chess player to defeat the reigning world number one (Garry Kasparov) in a game,[46][47] and in 2005 she became the first female player to play for a small-scale World Chess Championship, which she did in the FIDE World Chess Championship 2005; she had previously participated in large, 100+ player knockout tournaments for the world championship, but this was a small 8-player invitational.\nRecently, Hou Yifan has been the leading female chess player, for example winning the Biel GM tournament in 2017.[48]\nIn February 2017,[49] the Iranian Chess Federation[50] banned Dorsa Derakhshani from playing for the national team or in national tournaments after she played in the 2017 Gibraltar Chess Festival without wearing a hijab.[51][52]\nThe 2015 Women's World Champion, Mariya Muzychuk, and US Women's Champion Naz\u00ed Paikidze elected not to attend the Women's World Chess Championship 2017, out of protest at the tournament's location in Iran, where participants were required to wear a hijab in public.[53] In December 2022, Iranian player Sarasadat Khademalsharieh planned not to return to Iran after not wearing a hijab during the FIDE World Rapid and Blitz Chess Championships, amid protests against the Iranian government.[54][55]\nIn 2021 FIDE announced the largest-yet sponsorship deal for women's chess, with the breast enlargement company Motiva; this move met with both criticism and support from female chess players.[56] FIDE declared 2022 the \"Year of Woman in Chess\".[57]", "links":
