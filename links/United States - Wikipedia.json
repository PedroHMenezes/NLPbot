{"United States - Wikipedia": {"text": "The United States of America (U.S.A. or USA), commonly known as the United States (U.S. or US) or America, is a country primarily located in North America. It consists of 50 states, a federal district, five major unincorporated territories, nine Minor Outlying Islands,[i] and 326 Indian reservations. The United States is the world's third-largest country by both land and total area.[c] It shares land borders with Canada to its north and with Mexico to its south and has maritime borders with the Bahamas, Cuba, Russia, and other nations.[j] With a population of over 333 million,[k] it is the most populous country in the Americas and the third most populous in the world. The national capital of the United States is Washington, D.C. and its most populous city and principal financial center is New York City.\nPaleo-Americans migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago, and are the ancestors of modern Native Americans. The native population declined after European arrival in the 16th century, primarily from diseases such as smallpox and measles, becoming increasingly displaced. Great Britain's Thirteen Colonies, in what is now the eastern U.S., quarreled with the British Crown over taxation and political representation, leading to the American Revolution (1765\u20131791). After the Revolution, the United States gained independence, the first nation-state founded on Enlightenment principles of liberal democracy. In the late 18th century, the U.S. began expanding across North America. By 1848, it spanned the continent from east to west. Profound sectional division surrounding slavery in the Southern United States led to the secession of the Confederate States of America, which fought the remaining states of the Union during the American Civil War (1861\u20131865). With the Union's victory and preservation, slavery was abolished nationally by the Thirteenth Amendment.\nBy 1900, the United States had established itself as a world power, becoming the world's largest economy. After Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the U.S. entered World War II on the Allied side. The aftermath of the war left the United States and the Soviet Union as the world's two superpowers and led to the Cold War. During the Cold War, both countries engaged in a struggle for ideological dominance but avoided direct military conflict. They also competed in the Space Race, which culminated in the 1969 landing of Apollo 11, making the U.S. the first and only nation to ever land humans on the Moon. Simultaneously, the civil rights movement (1954\u20131968) led to court rulings and legislation abolishing codified racial discrimination against African-Americans. With the Soviet Union's collapse and the subsequent end of the Cold War in 1991, the United States emerged as the world's sole superpower. Following the September 11 attacks in 2001, the United States became a lead member of the Global War on Terrorism.\nThe United States government is a federal republic with three separate branches of government. It has a bicameral legislature composed of the House of Representatives, a lower house determined by state population; and the Senate, an upper house based on equal representation for each state. Many policy issues are decentralized, with widely differing laws by state. It is a representative democracy and has a market economy. The U.S. ranks very highly in international measures of quality of life, income and wealth, economic competitiveness, human rights, innovation, and education; it has low levels of perceived corruption and the highest median income per person of any polity in the world. It has high levels of incarceration and inequality and lacks universal health care. As a melting pot of cultures and ethnicities, the U.S. has been shaped by the world's largest immigrant population.\nA highly developed country, the American economy accounts for approximately a quarter of global GDP and is the world's largest by GDP at market exchange rates. By value, the United States is the world's largest importer and second-largest exporter. Although it accounts for just over 4.2% of the world's total population, the U.S. holds over 30% of the total wealth in the world, the largest share held by any country. The United States is a founding member of the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, Organization of American States, NATO, and is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The U.S. is the foremost military power in the world and a dominant political, cultural, and scientific force internationally.\nThe first documentary evidence of the phrase \"United States of America\" dates back to a letter from January 2, 1776, written by Stephen Moylan to Joseph Reed, George Washington's aide-de-camp. Moylan expressed his wish to go \"with full and ample powers from the United States of America to Spain\" to seek assistance in the revolutionary war effort.[27][28][29] The first known publication of the phrase \"United States of America\" was in an anonymous essay in The Virginia Gazette newspaper in Williamsburg, on April\u00a06, 1776.[30]\nBy June 1776, the name \"United States of America\" had appeared in drafts of the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, prepared by John Dickinson[31][32] and of the Declaration of Independence, written by Thomas Jefferson.[31]\nThe phrase \"United States\" was originally plural in American usage. It described a collection of states\u2014e.g., \"the United States are...\" The singular form became popular after the end of the Civil War and is now standard usage. A citizen of the United States is called an \"American\". \"United States\", \"American\", and \"U.S.\" refer to the country adjectivally (\"American values\", \"U.S.\u00a0forces\"). In English, the word \"American\" rarely refers to topics or subjects not directly connected with the United States.[33]\nIt is generally accepted that the first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 12,000 years ago; however, some evidence suggests an even earlier date of arrival.[34][35][36] The Clovis culture, which appeared around 11,000 BC, is believed to represent the first wave of human settlement of the Americas.[37][38] This was likely the first of three major waves of migration into North America; later waves brought the ancestors of present-day Athabaskans, Aleuts, and Eskimos.[39]\nOver time, indigenous cultures in North America grew increasingly sophisticated, and some, such as the pre-Columbian Mississippian culture in the southeast, developed advanced agriculture, architecture, and complex societies.[40] The city-state of Cahokia is the largest, most complex pre-Columbian archaeological site in the modern-day United States.[41] In the Four Corners region, Ancestral Puebloan culture developed from centuries of agricultural experimentation.[42] The Algonquian are one of the most populous and widespread North American indigenous peoples. This grouping consists of the peoples who speak Algonquian languages.[43] Historically, these peoples were prominent along the Atlantic Coast and into the interior along the Saint Lawrence River and around the Great Lakes. Before Europeans came into contact, most Algonquian settlements lived by hunting and fishing, although many supplemented their diet by cultivating corn, beans and squash (the \"Three Sisters\"). The Ojibwe cultivated wild rice.[44] The Haudenosaunee confederation of the Iroquois, located in the southern Great Lakes region, was established at some point between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries.[45]\nEstimating the native population of North America during European contact is difficult.[46][47] Douglas H. Ubelaker of the Smithsonian Institution estimated a population of 93,000 in the South Atlantic states and a population of 473,000 in the Gulf states,[48] but most academics regard this figure as too low.[46] Anthropologist Henry F. Dobyns believed the populations were much higher, suggesting around 1.1 million along the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, 2.2 million people living between Florida and Massachusetts, 5.2 million in the Mississippi Valley and tributaries, and around 700,000 people in the Florida peninsula.[46][47]\nClaims of very early colonization of coastal New England by the Norse are disputed and controversial.[49][50][failed verification] Christopher Columbus had landed in Puerto Rico on his 1493 voyage, and San Juan was settled by the Spanish a decade later.[51] The first documented arrival of Europeans in the continental United States is that of Spanish conquistadors such as Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n, who made his first expedition to Florida in 1513.[52] The Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano, sent by France to the New World in 1525, encountered Native American inhabitants of what is now called New York Bay.[53] The Spanish set up the first settlements in Florida and New Mexico, such as Saint Augustine, often considered the nation's oldest city,[54] and Santa Fe. The French established their own settlements along the Mississippi River and Gulf of Mexico, notably New Orleans and Mobile.[55]\nSuccessful English colonization of the eastern coast of North America began with the Virginia Colony in 1607 at Jamestown and with the Pilgrims' colony at Plymouth in 1620.[56][57] The continent's first elected legislative assembly, Virginia's House of Burgesses, was founded in 1619. Harvard College was established in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1636 as the first institution of higher education. The Mayflower Compact and the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut established precedents for representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies.[58][59] Many English settlers were dissenting Christians who came seeking religious freedom. The native population of America declined after European arrival for various reasons,[60][61][62] primarily from diseases such as smallpox and measles.[63][64]\nIn the early days of colonization, many European settlers experienced food shortages, disease, and conflicts with Native Americans, such as in King Philip's War. Native Americans were also often fighting neighboring tribes and European settlers. In many cases the natives and settlers came to depend on each other. Settlers traded for food and animal pelts; natives for guns, tools and other European goods.[65] American Indians taught many settlers to cultivate corn, beans, and other foodstuffs. European missionaries and others felt it was important to \"civilize\" the Native Americans and urged them to adopt European agricultural practices and lifestyles.[66][67] However, with the increased European colonization of North America, Native Americans were displaced and often killed during conflicts.[68]\nEuropean settlers also began trafficking African slaves into Colonial America via the transatlantic slave trade.[69] By the turn of the 18th century, slavery had supplanted indentured servitude as the main source of agricultural labor for the cash crops in the American South.[70] Colonial society was divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery, and several colonies passed acts for or against the practice.[71][72]\nThe Thirteen Colonies[l] that would become the United States of America were administered by the British as overseas dependencies.[73] All nonetheless had local governments with elections open to white male property owners, except Jews and Catholics in some areas.[74][75][76][77][78] With very high birth rates, low death rates, and steady settlement, the colonial population grew rapidly, eclipsing Native American populations.[79] The Christian revivalist movement of the 1730s and 1740s known as the Great Awakening fueled interest both in religion and in religious liberty.[80]\nDuring the Seven Years' War (1756\u20131763), known in the U.S. as the French and Indian War, British forces captured Canada from the French. The Treaty of Paris (1763) created a much smaller Province of Quebec, which still included the Ohio valley and the upper Mississippi valley, thereby isolating Canada's francophone population from the English-speaking colonial dependencies of Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and the Thirteen Colonies.[relevant?] Excluding the Native Americans who lived there, the Thirteen Colonies had a population of over 2.1\u00a0million in 1770, about a third that of Britain. Despite continuing new arrivals, the rate of natural increase was such that by the 1770s only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas.[81] The colonies' distance from Britain had allowed the development of self-government, but their unprecedented success motivated British monarchs to periodically seek to reassert royal authority.[82]\nThe American Revolution separated the Thirteen Colonies from the British Empire, and included the first successful war of independence by a non-European entity against a European power in modern history. By the 18th century the American Enlightenment and the political philosophies of liberalism were pervasive among leaders. Americans began to develop an ideology of \"republicanism\", asserting that government rested on the consent of the governed. They demanded their \"rights as Englishmen\" and \"no taxation without representation\".[83][84] The British insisted on administering the colonies through a Parliament that did not have a single representative responsible for any American constituency, and the conflict escalated into war.[85]\nIn 1774, the First Continental Congress passed the Continental Association, which mandated a colonies-wide boycott of British goods. The American Revolutionary War began the following year, catalyzed by events like the Stamp Act and the Boston Tea Party that were rooted in colonial disagreement with British governance.[86][87] The Second Continental Congress, an assembly representing the United Colonies, unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence on July\u00a04, 1776 (annually celebrated as Independence Day).[88] In 1781, the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union established a decentralized government that operated until 1789.[88] In 1777, the American victory at the Battle of Saratoga resulted in the capture of a British army, and led to France and their ally Spain joining in the war against them. After the surrender of a second British army at the siege of Yorktown in 1781, Britain signed a peace treaty. American sovereignty became internationally recognized, and the new nation took possession of substantial territory east of the Mississippi River, from what is today Canada in the north and Florida in the south.[89]\nAs it became increasingly apparent that the Confederation was insufficient to govern the new country, nationalists advocated for and led the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 in writing the United States Constitution to replace it, ratified in state conventions in 1788. The U.S. Constitution is the oldest and longest-standing written and codified national constitution in force in the world today.[90] Going into force in 1789, this constitution reorganized the government into a federation administered by three branches (executive, judicial and legislative), on the principle of creating salutary checks and balances. George Washington, who had led the Continental Army to victory and then willingly relinquished power, was the first President elected under the new constitution. The Bill of Rights, forbidding federal restriction of personal freedoms and guaranteeing a range of legal protections, was adopted in 1791.[91] Tensions with Britain remained, however, leading to the War of 1812, which was fought to a draw.[92]\nAlthough the federal government outlawed American participation in the Atlantic slave trade in 1807, after 1820, cultivation of the highly profitable cotton crop exploded in the Deep South, and along with it, the use of slave labor.[93][94][95] The Second Great Awakening, especially in the period 1800\u20131840, converted millions to evangelical Protestantism. In the North, it energized multiple social reform movements, including abolitionism;[96] in the South, Methodists and Baptists proselytized among slave populations.[97]\nIn the late 18th century, American settlers began to expand further westward, some of them with a sense of manifest destiny.[100][101] The 1803 Louisiana Purchase almost doubled the nation's area,[102] Spain ceded Florida and other Gulf Coast territory in 1819,[103] the Republic of Texas was annexed in 1845 during a period of expansionism,[101] and the 1846 Oregon Treaty with Britain led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest.[104] Additionally, the Trail of Tears in the 1830s exemplified the Indian removal policy that forcibly resettled Indians. This further expanded acreage under mechanical cultivation, increasing surpluses for international markets. This prompted a long series of American Indian Wars west of the Mississippi River[105] and eventually conflict with Mexico.[106] Most of these conflicts ended with the cession of Native American territory and their confinement to Indian reservations. Victory in the Mexican\u2013American War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest, and the U.S. spanned the continent.[100][107] The California Gold Rush of 1848\u20131849 spurred migration to the Pacific coast, which led to the California Genocide[108] and the creation of additional western states.[109] Economic development was spurred by giving vast quantities of land, nearly 10% of the total area of the United States, to white European settlers as part of the Homestead Acts, as well as making land grants to private railroad companies and colleges.[110] Prior to the Civil War, the prohibition or expansion of slavery into these territories exacerbated tensions over the debate around abolitionism.\nIrreconcilable sectional conflict regarding the enslavement of those of black African descent[111] was the primary cause of the American Civil War.[112] With the 1860 election of Republican Abraham Lincoln, conventions in eleven slave states\u2014all in the Southern United States\u2014declared secession and formed the Confederate States of America, while the federal government (the \"Union\") maintained that secession was unconstitutional and illegitimate.[113] On April 12, 1861, the Confederacy initiated military conflict by bombarding Fort Sumter, a federal garrison in Charleston harbor, South Carolina. The ensuing Civil War (1861\u20131865) was the deadliest military conflict in American history resulting in the deaths of approximately 620,000 soldiers from both sides and upwards of 50,000 civilians, almost all of them in the South.[114]\nReconstruction began in earnest following the defeat of the Confederates. While President Lincoln attempted to foster friendship and forgiveness between the Union and the former Confederacy, his assassination on April\u00a014, 1865 drove a wedge between North and South again. Republicans in the federal government made it their goal to oversee the rebuilding of the South and to ensure the rights of African Americans. They persisted until the Compromise of 1877, when the Republicans agreed to cease enforcing the rights of African Americans in the South in order for Democrats to concede the presidential election of 1876. Influential Southern whites, calling themselves \"Redeemers\", took local control of the South after the end of Reconstruction, beginning the nadir of American race relations. From 1890 to 1910, the Redeemers established so-called Jim Crow laws, disenfranchising almost all blacks and some impoverished whites throughout the region. Blacks would face racial segregation nationwide, especially in the South.[115] They also lived under constant threat of vigilante violence, including lynching.[116]\nNational infrastructure, including telegraph and transcontinental railroads, spurred economic growth and greater settlement and development of the American Old West. After the American Civil War, new transcontinental railways made relocation easier for settlers, expanded internal trade, and increased conflicts with Native Americans.[118] Electric light and the telephone drastically changed communication and urban life.[119]\nMainland expansion also included the purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867.[120] In 1893, pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the Hawaiian monarchy and formed the Republic of Hawaii, which the U.S. annexed in 1898. Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines were ceded by Spain in the same year, by the Treaty of Paris (1898) following the Spanish\u2013American War.[121] Neither the Foraker Act (1900), nor the Insular Cases (1901) accorded US citizenship to Puerto Ricans. One month prior to American entry into World War I, citizenship was extended to Puerto Ricans via the Jones\u2013Shafroth Act (1917).[122]:\u200a60\u201363\u200a In November 1903, the US acquired a perpetual lease of the Panama Canal Zone via the Hay\u2013Bunau-Varilla Treaty after providing naval aid preventing Colombia from putting down the rebellion which led to the creation of an independent Panama. The logistics of the November uprising were prepared in New York.[122]:\u200a67\u200a American Samoa was acquired by the United States in 1900 after the end of the Second Samoan Civil War.[123] The U.S. Virgin Islands were purchased from Denmark in 1917.[124]\nRapid economic development during the late 19th and early 20th centuries fostered the rise of many prominent industrialists. Tycoons like Cornelius Vanderbilt, John D. Rockefeller, and Andrew Carnegie led the nation's progress in the railroad, petroleum, and steel industries. Banking became a major part of the economy, with J. P. Morgan playing a notable role. In the North, urbanization and an unprecedented influx of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe supplied a surplus of labor for the country's industrialization.[126] The American economy boomed, becoming the world's largest.[127] These dramatic changes were accompanied by significant increases in economic inequality, immigration, and social unrest, which prompted the rise of organized labor along with populist, socialist, and anarchist movements.[128][129][130] This period eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era, which saw significant reforms including health and safety regulation of consumer goods, the rise of labor unions, and greater antitrust measures to ensure competition among businesses and attention to worker conditions. The Great Migration beginning around 1910 also brought millions of African Americans to Northern urban centers from the rural South.[131]\nThe last vestiges of the Progressive Era resulted in women's suffrage and alcohol prohibition.[132][133][134] The first state to grant women the right to vote had been Wyoming, in 1869, followed by some other states[135] before the women's rights movement won passage of a constitutional amendment granting nationwide women's suffrage in 1920.[136]\nThe United States remained neutral from the outbreak of World War I in 1914 until 1917 when it joined the war as an \"associated power\" alongside the Allies of World War I, helping to turn the tide against the Central Powers. In 1919, President Woodrow Wilson took a leading diplomatic role at the Paris Peace Conference and advocated strongly for the U.S. to join the League of Nations. However, the Senate refused to approve this and did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles that established the League of Nations.[137]\nThe 1920s and 1930s saw the rise of radio for mass communication and the invention of early television.[138] The prosperity of the Roaring Twenties ended with the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression. After his election as President in 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt responded with the New Deal.[139] The Dust Bowl of the mid-1930s impoverished many farming communities and spurred a new wave of western migration.[140]\nAt first neutral during World War II, the United States in March 1941 began supplying hundreds of billions worth of materiel to the Allies. A total of $50.1 billion (equivalent to $719\u00a0billion in 2021) worth of supplies was shipped in 1941\u20131945, or 17% of the total war expenditures of the U.S.[141] In all, $31.4 billion went to the United Kingdom, $11.3 billion to the Soviet Union, $3.2 billion to France, $1.6 billion to China, and the remaining $2.6 billion to other Allies. On December\u00a07, 1941, the Empire of Japan launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, prompting the United States to militarily join the Allies against the Axis powers, and in the following year, to intern about 120,000 Japanese and Japanese Americans.[142][143] The U.S. pursued a \"Europe first\" defense policy,[144] with the Philippines being invaded and occupied by Japan until the country's liberation by the U.S.-led forces in 1944\u20131945. During the war, the United States was one of the \"Four Policemen\"[145] who met to plan the postwar world, along with Britain, the Soviet Union, and China.[146][147] The United States emerged relatively unscathed from the war, and with even greater economic and military influence.[148]\nThe United States played a leading role in the Bretton Woods and Yalta conferences, which signed agreements on new international financial institutions and Europe's postwar reorganization. As an Allied victory was won in Europe, a 1945 international conference held in San Francisco produced the United Nations Charter, which became active after the war.[149] The United States developed the first nuclear weapons and used them on Japan in the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945; the Japanese subsequently surrendered on September 2, ending World War II.[150][151]\nAfter World War II, the United States financed and implemented the Marshall Plan to help rebuild and economically revive war-torn Europe; disbursements paid between 1948 and 1952 would total $13 billion ($115 billion in 2021).[152] Also at this time, geopolitical tensions between the United States and Soviet Russia led to the Cold War, driven by an ideological divide between capitalism and communism.[153] The two countries dominated the military affairs of Europe, with the U.S. and its NATO allies on one side and the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact satellite states on the other.[154] The U.S. sometimes opposed Third World movements that it viewed as Soviet-sponsored, sometimes pursuing direct action for regime change against left-wing governments.[155] Unlike the US, the USSR concentrated on its own recovery, seizing and transferring most of Germany's industrial plants, and it exacted war reparations its Soviet Bloc satellites using Soviet-dominated joint enterprises. It also instituted trading arrangements deliberately designed to favour the country. Moscow controlled the Communist parties that ruled the satellite states, and they followed orders from the Kremlin. Historian Mark Kramer concludes: \"The net outflow of resources from eastern Europe to the Soviet Union was approximately $15 billion to $20 billion in the first decade after World War II, an amount roughly equal to the total aid provided by the United States to western Europe under the Marshall Plan.\"[156] American troops fought the communist forces in the Korean War of 1950\u20131953,[157] and the U.S. became increasingly involved in the Vietnam War (1955\u20131975), introducing combat forces in 1965.[158] Their competition to achieve superior spaceflight capability led to the Space Race, which culminated in the U.S. becoming the first and only nation to land people on the Moon in 1969.[157] While both countries engaged in proxy wars and developed powerful nuclear weapons, they avoided direct military conflict.[154]\nAt home, the United States experienced sustained economic expansion, urbanization, and a rapid growth of its population and middle class following World War II. Construction of an Interstate Highway System transformed the nation's transportation infrastructure in decades to come.[159][160] In 1959, the United States admitted Alaska and Hawaii to become the 49th and 50th states, formally expanding beyond the contiguous United States.[161]\nThe growing civil rights movement used nonviolence to confront racism, with Martin Luther King Jr. becoming a prominent leader.[162] President Lyndon B. Johnson initiated legislation that led to a series of policies addressing poverty and racial inequalities, in what he termed the \"Great Society\". The launch of a \"War on Poverty\" expanded entitlements and welfare spending, leading to the creation of the Food Stamp Program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, along with national health insurance programs Medicare and Medicaid.[163] A combination of court decisions and legislation, culminating in the Civil Rights Act of 1968, made significant improvements.[164][165][166] Meanwhile, a counterculture movement grew, which was fueled by opposition to the Vietnam War, mainstream experimentation with psychedelics and cannabis, the Black Power movement, and the sexual revolution.[167] The women's movement in the U.S. broadened the debate on women's rights and made gender equality a major social goal. The 1960s Sexual Revolution liberalized American attitudes to sexuality;[168] the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City marked the beginning of the modern gay rights movement in the Western world.[169][170]\nThe United States supported Israel during the Yom Kippur War; in response, the country faced an oil embargo from OPEC nations, sparking the 1973 oil crisis. The presidency of Richard Nixon saw the American withdrawal from Vietnam but also the Watergate scandal, which led to his resignation in disgrace and a decline in public trust of government that expanded for decades.[171] After a surge in female labor participation around the 1970s, by 1985, the majority of women aged 16 and over were employed.[172] The 1970s and early 1980s also saw the onset of stagflation.\nAfter his election in 1980 President Ronald Reagan responded to economic stagnation with neoliberal reforms and accelerated the rollback strategy towards the Soviet Union after its invasion of Afghanistan.[173][174][175][176] During Reagan's presidency, the federal debt held by the public nearly tripled in nominal terms, from $738 billion to $2.1 trillion.[177] This led to the United States moving from the world's largest international creditor to the world's largest debtor nation.[178] The collapse of the USSR's network of satellite states in Eastern Europe in 1989 and the subsequent dissolution of the country itself in 1991 ended the Cold War with American victory,[179][180][181][182] ensuring a global unipolarity[183] in which the U.S. was unchallenged as the world's sole superpower.[184]\nFearing the spread of regional international instability from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, in August 1991, President George H. W. Bush launched and led the Gulf War against Iraq, expelling Iraqi forces and dissolving the Iraqi-backed puppet state in Kuwait.[185] During the administration of President Bill Clinton in 1994, the U.S. signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), causing trade among the U.S., Canada, and Mexico to soar.[186] Due to the dot-com boom, stable monetary policy, and reduced social welfare spending, the 1990s saw the longest economic expansion in modern U.S. history.[187]\nOn September 11, 2001, al-Qaeda terrorist hijackers flew passenger planes into the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., killing nearly 3,000 people.[188] In response, President George W. Bush launched the war on terror, which included a nearly 20-year war in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2021 and the 2003\u20132011 Iraq War.[189][190] Government policy designed to promote affordable housing,[191] widespread failures in corporate and regulatory governance,[192] and historically low interest rates set by the Federal Reserve[193] led to a housing bubble in 2006. This culminated in the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008 and the Great Recession, the nation's largest economic contraction since the Great Depression.[194]\nBarack Obama, the first multiracial[195] President with African-American ancestry, was elected in 2008 amid the financial crisis.[196] By the end of his second term, the stock market, median household income and net worth, and the number of persons with jobs were all at record levels, while the unemployment rate was well below the historical average.[197][198][199][200][201] His signature legislative accomplishment was the Affordable Care Act (ACA), popularly known as \"Obamacare\". It represented the U.S. health care system's most significant regulatory overhaul and expansion of coverage since Medicare in 1965. As a result, the uninsured share of the population was cut in half, while the number of newly insured Americans was estimated to be between 20 and 24 million.[202] After Obama served two terms, Republican Donald Trump was elected as the 45th president in 2016. His election is viewed as one of the biggest political upsets in American history.[203] Trump held office through the first waves of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting COVID-19 recession starting in 2020 that exceeded even the Great Recession earlier in the century.[204]\nPolitical polarization has become significant during the 2010s, with abortion access, same-sex marriage, the transgender rights movement, race, police brutality, immigration, and marijuana becoming center topics of debate. Several protests have since become among the largest in U.S. history.[205][206]  On January 6, 2021, supporters of the outgoing President, Trump, stormed the U.S. Capitol in an unsuccessful effort to disrupt the Electoral College vote count that would confirm Democrat Joe Biden as the 46th president.[207] In 2022, the Supreme Court ruled that there is no constitutional right to an abortion, causing another wave of protests.[208] The United States responded significantly to Russia and Belarus after their invasion of Ukraine, with the country applying harsh sanctions on Russia and sending tens of billions of dollars of military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine.[209]\nThe 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia occupy a combined area of 3,119,885 square miles (8,080,470\u00a0km2). Of this area, 2,959,064 square miles (7,663,940\u00a0km2) is contiguous land, composing 83.65% of total U.S. land area.[210][211] About 15% is occupied by Alaska, a state in northwestern North America, with the remainder in Hawaii, a state and archipelago in the central Pacific, and the five populated but unincorporated insular territories of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.[212] Measured by only land area, the United States is third in size behind Russia and China, and just ahead of Canada.[213]\nThe United States is the world's third- or fourth-largest nation by total area (land and water), ranking behind Russia and Canada and nearly equal to China. The ranking varies depending on how two territories disputed by China and India are counted, and how the total size of the United States is measured.[c][214]\nThe coastal plain of the Atlantic seaboard gives way further inland to deciduous forests and the rolling hills of the Piedmont.[215] The Appalachian Mountains and the Adirondack massif divide the eastern seaboard from the Great Lakes and the grasslands of the Midwest.[216] The Mississippi\u2013Missouri River, the world's fourth longest river system, runs mainly north\u2013south through the heart of the country. The flat, fertile prairie of the Great Plains stretches to the west, interrupted by a highland region in the southeast.[216]\nThe Rocky Mountains, west of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, peaking at over 14,000 feet (4,300\u00a0m) in Colorado.[217] Farther west are the rocky Great Basin and deserts such as the Chihuahua, Sonoran, and Mojave.[218] The Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges run close to the Pacific coast, both ranges also reaching altitudes higher than 14,000 feet (4,300\u00a0m). The lowest and highest points in the contiguous United States are in the state of California,[219] and only about 84 miles (135\u00a0km) apart.[220] At an elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190.5\u00a0m), Alaska's Denali is the highest peak in the country and in North America.[221] Active volcanoes are common throughout Alaska's Alexander and Aleutian Islands, and Hawaii consists of volcanic islands. The supervolcano underlying Yellowstone National Park in the Rockies is the continent's largest volcanic feature.[222]\nThe United States, with its large size and geographic variety, includes most climate types. To the east of the 100th meridian, the climate ranges from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in the south.[223]\nThe Great Plains west of the 100th meridian are semi-arid. Many mountainous areas of the American West have an alpine climate. The climate is arid in the Great Basin, desert in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California, and oceanic in coastal Oregon and Washington and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar. Hawaii and the southern tip of Florida are tropical, as well as its territories in the Caribbean and the Pacific.[224]\nStates bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes, and most of the world's tornadoes occur in the country, mainly in Tornado Alley areas in the Midwest and South.[225] Overall, the United States receives more high-impact extreme weather incidents than any other country in the world.[226]\nExtreme weather has become more frequent in the U.S., with three times the number of reported heat waves as in the 1960s. Of the ten warmest years ever recorded in the 48 contiguous states, eight have occurred since 1998. In the American Southwest, droughts have become more persistent and more severe.[227]\nThe U.S. is one of 17 megadiverse countries containing large numbers of endemic species: about 17,000 species of vascular plants occur in the contiguous United States and Alaska, and more than 1,800 species of flowering plants are found in Hawaii, few of which occur on the mainland.[229] The United States is home to 428 mammal species, 784 birds, 311 reptiles, and 295 amphibians,[230] and 91,000 insect species.[231]\nThere are 63 national parks which are managed by the National Park Service, and hundreds of other federally managed parks, forests, and wilderness areas managed by it and other agencies.[232] Altogether, the government owns about 28% of the country's land area,[233] mostly in the western states.[234] Most of this land is protected, though some is leased for oil and gas drilling, mining, logging, or cattle ranching, and about .86% is used for military purposes.[235][236]\nEnvironmental issues include debates on oil and nuclear energy, dealing with air and water pollution, the economic costs of protecting wildlife,[further explanation needed] logging and deforestation,[237][238] and climate change.[239][240] The most prominent environmental agency is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), created by presidential order in 1970.[241] The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act.[242] The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is intended to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats, which are monitored by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.[243]\nAs of 2020, the U.S. ranked 24th among 180 nations in the Environmental Performance Index.[244] The country joined the Paris Agreement on climate change in 2016, and has many other environmental commitments.[245] It withdrew from the Paris Agreement in 2020[246] but rejoined it in 2021.[247]\nThe United States is a federal republic of 50 states, a federal district, five territories and several uninhabited island possessions.[248][249][250] It is the world's oldest surviving federation, and, according to the World Economic Forum, the oldest democracy as well.[251] It is a representative democracy \"in which majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law.\"[252] Major democracy indexes uniformly classify the country as a liberal democracy.[253] The 2022 Corruption Perceptions Index and Global Corruption Barometer rank the United States as having low levels of both actual and perceived corruption.[254][255]\nThe U.S. Constitution serves as the country's supreme legal document, establishing the structure and responsibilities of the federal government and its relationship with the individual states. The Constitution has been amended 27 times;[256] the first ten amendments (Bill of Rights) and the Fourteenth Amendment form the central basis of Americans' individual rights. All laws and governmental procedures are subject to judicial review, and any law can be voided if the courts determine that it violates the Constitution. The principle of judicial review, not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, was established by the Supreme Court in Marbury v. Madison (1803).[257]\nIn the American federal system, sovereignty is shared between two levels of government: federal and state. Citizens of the states are also governed by local governments, which are administrative divisions of the states. The territories are administrative divisions of the federal government. Governance on many issues is decentralized, with widely differing state laws on abortion, cannabis, the death penalty,[n] guns, economic policy, and other issues.[261] States have increasingly restricted so-called \"conversion therapy\".[262][263] Prostitution is only legal in several counties of Nevada.[264]\nThe United States has operated under an uncodified two-party system for most of its history, although other parties have run candidates.[265] What the two dominant parties are has changed over time: the country is currently in either the Fifth or Sixth Party System. In current American political culture, the center-right Republican Party is considered \"conservative\" and the center-left Democratic Party is considered \"liberal\".[266] Both parties have no formal central organization at the national level that controls membership, elected officials or political policies; thus, each party has traditionally had factions and individuals that deviated from party positions.[267] Since the 1980s, the country has suffered from significant political polarization.[268]\nThe federal government comprises three branches, which are headquartered in Washington, D.C. and regulated by a system of checks and balances defined by the Constitution.[269]\nThe lower house, the House of Representatives, has 435 voting members, each representing a congressional district for a two-year term. House seats are apportioned among the states by population. Each state then draws single-member districts to conform with the census apportionment. The District of Columbia and the five major U.S. territories each have one member of Congress\u2014these members are not allowed to vote.[274]\nThe upper house, the Senate, has 100 members with each state having two senators, elected at large to six-year terms; one-third of Senate seats are up for election every two years. The District of Columbia and the five major U.S. territories do not have senators.[274] The Senate is unique among upper houses in being the most prestigious and powerful portion of the country's bicameral system; political scientists have frequently labeled it the \"most powerful upper house\" of any government.[275]\nThe President serves a four-year term and may be elected to the office no more than twice. The President is not elected by direct vote, but by an indirect electoral college system in which the determining votes are apportioned to the states and the District of Columbia.[276] The Supreme Court, led by the chief justice of the United States, has nine members, who serve for life. They are appointed by the sitting President when a vacancy becomes available.[277]\nEach of the 50 states holds jurisdiction over a geographic territory, where it shares sovereignty with the federal government. They are subdivided into counties or county equivalents, and further divided into municipalities. The District of Columbia is a federal district that contains the capital of the United States, the city of Washington.[278] Each state has an amount of presidential electors equal to the number of their representatives plus senators in Congress, and the District of Columbia has three electors.[279] Territories of the United States do not have presidential electors, therefore people there cannot vote for the president.[274]\nCitizenship is granted at birth in all states, the District of Columbia, and all major U.S. territories except American Samoa.[o][283][280] The United States observes limited tribal sovereignty of the American Indian nations, like states' sovereignty. American Indians are U.S. citizens and tribal lands are subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress and the federal courts. Like the states, tribes have some autonomy restrictions. They are prohibited from making war, engaging in their own foreign relations, and printing or issuing independent currency.[284] Indian reservations are usually contained within one state, but there are 12 reservations that cross state boundaries.[285]\nThe United States has an established structure of foreign relations, and it had the world's second-largest diplomatic corps in 2019.[286] It is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council,[287] and home to the United Nations headquarters.[288] The United States is also a member of the G7,[289] G20,[290] and OECD intergovernmental organizations.[291] Almost all countries have embassies and many have consulates (official representatives) in the country. Likewise, nearly all nations host formal diplomatic missions with United States, except Iran,[292] North Korea,[293] and Bhutan.[294] Though Taiwan does not have formal diplomatic relations with the U.S., it maintains close, if unofficial, relations. The United States also regularly supplies Taiwan with military equipment to deter potential Chinese aggression.[295]\nThe United States has a \"Special Relationship\" with the United Kingdom[296] and strong ties with Canada,[297] Australia,[298] New Zealand,[299] the Philippines,[300] Japan,[301] South Korea,[302] Israel,[303] and several European Union countries (France, Italy, Germany, Spain, and Poland).[304] The U.S. works closely with its NATO allies on military and national security issues, and with nations in the Americas through the Organization of American States and the United States\u2013Mexico\u2013Canada Free Trade Agreement. In South America, Colombia is traditionally considered to be the closest ally of the United States.[305] The U.S. exercises full international defense authority and responsibility for Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau through the Compact of Free Association.[306] The U.S. has become a key ally of Ukraine since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and began an invasion of Ukraine in 2022, significantly deteriorating relations with Russia in the process.[307] The U.S. has also experienced a deterioration of relations with China and grown closer to Taiwan.[308][309][310]\nThe President is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces and appoints its leaders, the secretary of defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Department of Defense, which is headquartered at the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., administers five of the six service branches, which are made up of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Space Force. The Coast Guard is administered by the Department of Homeland Security in peacetime and can be transferred to the Department of the Navy in wartime.[311] The United States spent $649 billion on its military in 2019, 36% of global military spending. At 4.7% of GDP, the percentage was the second-highest among all countries, after Saudi Arabia.[312] It also has more than 40% of the world's nuclear weapons, the second-largest after Russia.[313]\nIn 2019, all six branches of the U.S. Armed Forces reported 1.4\u00a0million personnel on active duty.[314] The Reserves and National Guard brought the total number of troops to 2.3\u00a0million.[314] The Department of Defense also employed about 700,000 civilians, not including contractors.[315] Military service in the United States is voluntary, although conscription may occur in wartime through the Selective Service System.[316] The United States has the third-largest combined armed forces in the world, behind the Chinese People's Liberation Army and Indian Armed Forces.[317]\nToday, American forces can be rapidly deployed by the Air Force's large fleet of transport aircraft, the Navy's 11 active aircraft carriers, and Marine expeditionary units at sea with the Navy, and Army's XVIII Airborne Corps and 75th Ranger Regiment deployed by Air Force transport aircraft. The Air Force can strike targets across the globe through its fleet of strategic bombers, maintains the air defense across the United States, and provides close air support to Army and Marine Corps ground forces.[318][319]\nThe Space Force operates the Global Positioning System (GPS, also widespread in civilian use worldwide), the Eastern and Western Ranges for all space launches, and the United States's Space Surveillance and Missile Warning networks.[320][321][322] The military operates about 800 bases and facilities abroad,[323] and maintains deployments greater than 100 active duty personnel in 25 foreign countries.[324]\nThere are about 18,000 U.S. police agencies from local to federal level in the United States.[325] Law in the United States is mainly enforced by local police departments and sheriff's offices. The state police provides broader services, and federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Marshals Service have specialized duties, such as protecting civil rights, national security and enforcing U.S. federal courts' rulings and federal laws.[326] State courts conduct most civil and criminal trials,[327] and federal courts handle designated crimes and appeals from the state criminal courts.[328]\nAs of 2020[update], the United States has an intentional homicide rate of 7 per 100,000 people.[329] A cross-sectional analysis of the World Health Organization Mortality Database from 2010 showed that United States homicide rates \"were 7.0 times higher than in other high-income countries, driven by a gun homicide rate that was 25.2 times higher.\"[330]\nAs of 2023[update], the United States has the sixth highest documented incarceration rate and second-largest prison population in the world.[331] In 2019, the total prison population for those sentenced to more than a year was 1,430,800, corresponding to a ratio of 419 per 100,000 residents and the lowest since 1995.[332] Some think tanks place that number higher, such as Prison Policy Initiative's estimate of 2.3 million.[333] Various states have attempted to reduce their prison populations via government policies and grassroots initiatives.[334]\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund, the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) of $25.4\u00a0trillion constitutes 25% of the gross world product at market exchange rates and over 15% of the gross world product at purchasing power parity (PPP).[337][14] From 1983 to 2008, U.S. real compounded annual GDP growth was 3.3%, compared to a 2.3% weighted average for the rest of the G7.[338] The country ranks first in the world by nominal GDP,[339] second by GDP (PPP),[14] seventh by nominal GDP per capita,[337] and eighth by GDP (PPP) per capita.[14] As of 2022, the United States was ranked 25th out of 169 countries on the Social Progress Index, which measures \"the extent to which countries provide for the social and environmental needs of their citizens.\"[340] The U.S. has been the world's largest economy since at least 1900.[341]\nThe United States is at or near the forefront of technological advancement and innovation[342] in many economic fields, especially in artificial intelligence; computers; pharmaceuticals; and medical, aerospace and military equipment.[343] The nation's economy is fueled by abundant natural resources, a well-developed infrastructure, and high productivity.[344] It has the second-highest total-estimated value of natural resources, valued at US$44.98\u00a0trillion in 2019, although sources differ on their estimates. Americans have the highest average household and employee income among OECD member states.[345] In 2013, they had the sixth-highest median household income, down from fourth-highest in 2010.[346][347]\nThe U.S. dollar is the currency most used in international transactions and is the world's foremost reserve currency, backed by the country's dominant economy, its military, the petrodollar system, and its linked eurodollar and large U.S. treasuries market.[335] Several countries use it as their official currency and in others it is the de facto currency.[351][352] The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq are the world's largest stock exchanges by market capitalization and trade volume.[353][354]\nThe largest U.S. trading partners are China, the European Union, Canada, Mexico, India, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and Taiwan.[355] The U.S. is the world's largest importer and the second-largest exporter.[356] It has free trade agreements with several countries, including the USMCA.[357] The U.S. ranked second in the Global Competitiveness Report in 2019, after Singapore.[358] Many of the world's largest companies, such as Alphabet (Google), Amazon, AT&T, Apple, Coca-Cola, Disney, General Motors, McDonald's, Nike, Meta, Microsoft, Pepsi, and Walmart, were founded and are headquartered in the United States.[359] Of the world's 500 largest companies, 124 are headquartered in the U.S.[359]\nWhile its economy has reached a post-industrial level of development, the United States remains an industrial power.[360] As of 2018, the U.S. is the second-largest manufacturing nation after China.[361] In 2013, the U.S. national debt to GDP ratio surpassed 100% when both debt and GDP were approximately $16.7 trillion.[362]\nAt US$69,392 in 2020, the United States was ranked first in the world by average yearly wage based on the OECD data, and it had the highest median income in the world at US$46,625 in 2021.[363][364] Despite the fact that the U.S. only accounted for 4.24% of the global population, American citizens collectively possessed 30.2% of the world's total wealth as of 2021, the largest percentage of any country.[365] The U.S. also ranks first in the number of dollar billionaires and millionaires in the world, with 724 billionaires (as of 2021)[366] and nearly 22 million millionaires (2021).[367]\nThe United States has a smaller welfare state and redistributes less income through government action than most other high-income countries.[368] The  U.S. ranked the 52nd highest in income inequality among 167 countries in 2014,[369] and the highest compared to the rest of the developed world in 2018.[370][371]\nWealth in the United States is highly concentrated; the richest 10% of the adult population own 72% of the country's household wealth, while the bottom 50% own just 2%.[372] Income inequality in the U.S. remains at record highs,[373] with the top fifth of earners taking home more than half of all income[374] and giving the U.S. one of the widest income distributions among OECD members.[375] The United States is the only advanced economy that does not guarantee its workers paid vacation[376] and is one of a few countries in the world without federal paid family leave as a legal right.[377] The United States also has a higher percentage of low-income workers than almost any other developed nation, largely because of a weak collective bargaining system and lack of government support for at-risk workers.[378]\nThere were about 567,715 sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons in the U.S. in January 2019, with almost two-thirds staying in an emergency shelter or transitional housing program.[379] Attempts to combat homelessness include the Section 8 housing voucher program and implementation of the Housing First strategy across all levels of government.[380]\nIn 2011, 16.7\u00a0million children lived in food-insecure households, about 35% more than 2007 levels, though only 845,000 U.S. children (1.1%) saw reduced food intake or disrupted eating patterns at some point during the year, and most cases were not chronic.[381] As of June\u00a02018,[update] 40\u00a0million people, roughly 12.7% of the U.S. population, were living in poverty, including 13.3\u00a0million children. Of those impoverished, 18.5\u00a0million live in \"deep poverty\", family income below one-half of the federal government's poverty threshold.[371]\nThe United States has been a leader in technological innovation since the late 19th century and scientific research since the mid-20th century. Methods for producing interchangeable parts and the establishment of a machine tool industry enabled the U.S. to have large-scale manufacturing of sewing machines, bicycles, and other items in the late 19th century. In the early 20th century, factory electrification, the introduction of the assembly line, and other labor-saving techniques created the system of mass production.[382] In the 21st century, approximately two-thirds of research and development funding comes from the private sector.[383] In 2020, the United States was the country with the second-highest number of published scientific papers[384] and second most patents granted,[385] both after China. In 2021, the United States launched a total of 51 spaceflights. (China reported 55.)[386] The U.S. had 2,944 active satellites in space in December 2021, the highest number of any country.[387]\nIn 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was awarded the first U.S. patent for the telephone. Thomas Edison's research laboratory developed the phonograph, the first long-lasting light bulb, and the first viable movie camera.[388] The Wright brothers in 1903 made the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight, and the automobile companies of Ransom E. Olds and Henry Ford popularized the assembly line in the early 20th century.[389] The rise of fascism and Nazism in the 1920s and 30s led many European scientists, such as Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, and John von Neumann, to immigrate to the United States.[390] During World War II, the Manhattan Project developed nuclear weapons, ushering in the Atomic Age. During the Cold War, competition for superior missile capability ushered in the Space Race between the U.S. and Soviet Union.[391][392] The great American technological breakthroughs of the 20th century stem from the invention of the transistor in the 1950s, a key component in almost all modern electronics, which led to the development of microprocessors, software, personal computers, and the Internet.[393] In 2022, the United States ranked 2nd in the Global Innovation Index.[394] The United States also developed the Global Positioning System, which is the world's pre-eminent satellite navigation system.[395]\nAs of 2019[update], the United States receives approximately 80% of its energy from fossil fuels.[396] In 2019, the largest source of the country's energy came from petroleum (36.6%), followed by natural gas (32%), coal (11.4%), renewable sources (11.4%) and nuclear power (8.4%).[396] Americans constitute less than 5% of the world's population, but consume 17% of the world's energy.[397] They account for about 25% of the world's petroleum consumption, while producing only 6% of the world's annual petroleum supply.[398] The U.S. ranks as second-highest emitter of greenhouse gases, exceeded only by China.[399]\nThe United States's rail network, nearly all standard gauge, is the longest in the world, and exceeds 293,564\u00a0km (182,400\u00a0mi).[401] It handles mostly freight, with intercity passenger service primarily provided by Amtrak, a government-managed company that took over services previously run by private companies, to all but four states.[402][403]\nPersonal transportation is dominated by automobiles, which operate on a network of 4\u00a0million miles (6.4\u00a0million kilometers) of public roads, making it the longest network in the world.[404][405] The United States became the first country in the world to have a mass market for vehicle production and sales, and mass market production process.[406][407] As of 2022, the United States is the second-largest manufacturer of motor vehicles[408] and is home to Tesla, the world's most valuable car company.[409] General Motors held the title of the world's best-selling automaker from 1931 to 2008.[410] Currently, the U.S. has the world's second-largest automobile market by sales,[411] and has the highest vehicle ownership per capita in the world, with 816.4 vehicles per 1,000 Americans (2014).[412] In 2017, there were 255 million non-two wheel motor vehicles, or about 910 vehicles per 1,000 people.[413]\nThe civil airline industry is entirely privately owned and has been largely deregulated since 1978, while most major airports are publicly owned.[414] The three largest airlines in the world by passengers carried are U.S.-based; American Airlines is number one after its 2013 acquisition by US Airways.[415] Of the world's 50 busiest passenger airports, 16 are in the United States, including the top five and the busiest, Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport.[416][417] As of 2020[update], there are 19,919 total airports in the United States, of which 5,217 are designated as \"public use\", including for general aviation and other activities.[418]\nOf the fifty busiest container ports, four are located in the United States, of which the busiest is the Port of Los Angeles.[419] The country's inland waterways are the world's fifth-longest, and total 41,009\u00a0km (25,482\u00a0mi).[420]\nThe U.S. Census Bureau reported 331,449,281 residents as of April 1, 2020,[p][422] making the United States the third most populous nation in the world, after China and India.[423] According to the Bureau's U.S. Population Clock, on January\u00a028, 2021, the U.S. population had a net gain of one person every 100 seconds, or about 864 people per day.[424] In 2018, 52% of Americans age 15 and over were married, 6% were widowed, 10% were divorced, and 32% had never been married.[425] In 2021, the U.S. had a total fertility rate stood at 1.7 children per woman[426] and the world's highest rate (23%) of children living in single-parent households.[427]\nThe United States of America has a diverse population; 37 ancestry groups have more than one million members.[428] White Americans with ancestry from Europe, the Middle East or North Africa, form the largest racial and ethnic group at 57.8% of the United States population.[429][430] Hispanic and Latino Americans form the second-largest group and are 18.7% of the United States population. African Americans constitute the nation's third-largest ancestry group and are 12.1% of the total United States population.[428] Asian Americans are the country's fourth-largest group, composing 5.9% of the United States population, while the country's 3.7 million Native Americans account for about 1%.[428] In 2020, the median age of the United States population was 38.5 years.[423]\nAccording to the United Nations, the United States has the highest number of immigrant population in the world, with 50,661,149 people.[431][432]\nIn 2018, there were almost 90 million immigrants and U.S.-born children of immigrants in the United States, accounting for 28% of the overall U.S. population.[433] In 2017, out of the U.S. foreign-born population, some 45% (20.7\u00a0million) were naturalized citizens, 27% (12.3\u00a0million) were lawful permanent residents, 6% (2.2\u00a0million) were temporary lawful residents, and 23% (10.5\u00a0million) were unauthorized immigrants.[434] The United States led the world in refugee resettlement for decades, admitting more refugees than the rest of the world combined.[435]\nEnglish (specifically, American English) is the de facto national language of the United States. Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws\u2014such as U.S. naturalization requirements\u2014standardize English, and most states have declared English as the official language.[436] Three states and four U.S. territories have recognized local or indigenous languages in addition to English, including Hawaii (Hawaiian),[437] Alaska (twenty Native languages),[q][438] South Dakota (Sioux),[439] American Samoa (Samoan), Puerto Rico (Spanish), Guam (Chamorro), and the Northern Mariana Islands (Carolinian and Chamorro). In Puerto Rico, Spanish is more widely spoken than English.[440]\nAccording to the American Community Survey, in 2010 some 229 million people (out of the total U.S. population of 308 million) spoke only English at home. More than 37 million spoke Spanish at home, making it the second most commonly used language in the United States. Other languages spoken at home by one million people or more include Chinese (2.8 million), Tagalog (1.6 million), Vietnamese (1.4 million), French (1.3 million), Korean (1.1 million), and German (1 million).[441]\nThe most widely taught foreign languages in the United States, in terms of enrollment numbers from kindergarten through university undergraduate education, are Spanish (around 7.2\u00a0million students), French (1.5\u00a0million), and German (500,000). Other commonly taught languages include Latin, Japanese, American Sign Language, Italian, and Chinese.[442][443]\nSelf-identified religious affiliation in the United States (2023 The Wall Street Journal-NORC poll):[444]\nReligious affilation in the United States is among the most diverse in the world[445] and varies significantly by region.[446]\nThe First Amendment guarantees the free exercise of religion and forbids Congress from passing laws respecting its establishment.[447][448] A majority of Americans identify as Christian (predominately Catholic, mainline Protestant, or evangelical). However, most do not consider religion an important part of their life,[444] do not regularly attend religious services,[444] and have low confidence in religious institutions.[449] According to the World Values Survey in 2017, the United States is more secular than the median country; they ranked the United States the 32nd least religious country in the world.[450] Until the 1990s, the country was an outlier among highly developed countries: combining a high level of religiosity and wealth, although this has lessened since.[450][451][452][453] The country has the world's largest Christian population.[454]\nGallup polls during the early 2020s found that about 81% of Americans believe in some conception of a God and 45% report praying on a daily basis.[455][456][457] According to a poll by them in December 2022, \"31% report attending a church, synagogue, mosque or temple weekly or nearly weekly today\".[457] In the \"Bible Belt\", which is located primarily within the Southern United States, socially conservative evangelical Protestantism plays a significant role culturally. New England and the Western United States tend to be less religious.[446] Around 6% of Americans claim a non-Christian faith;[451] the largest of which are Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism.[458] The United States either has the first or second-largest Jewish population in the world, and the most outside of Israel.[459] \"Ceremonial deism\" is common in American culture.[447][460]\nAround 30% of Americans describe themselves as having no religion.[451] Membership in a house of worship fell from 70% in 1999 to 47% in 2020, much of the decline related to the number of Americans expressing no religious preference. Membership also fell among those who identified with a specific religious group.[461][462] According to Gallup, trust in \"the church or organized religion\" has declined significantly since the 1970s.[449] According to the 2022 Cooperative Election Study, younger Americans are significantly less religious. Among Generation Z, a near-majority consider themselves atheist, agnostic, or nothing in particular.[463]\nAbout 82% of Americans live in urban areas, including suburbs;[214] about half of those reside in cities with populations over 50,000.[464] In 2008, 273 incorporated municipalities had populations over 100,000, nine cities had more than one million residents, and four cities (New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston) had populations exceeding two million.[465] Many U.S. metropolitan populations are growing rapidly, particularly in the South and West.[466]\nAmerican public education is operated by state and local governments and regulated by the United States Department of Education through restrictions on federal grants. In most states, children are required to attend school from the age of five or six (beginning with kindergarten or first grade) until they turn 18 (generally bringing them through twelfth grade, the end of high school); some states allow students to leave school at 16 or 17.[467] Of Americans 25 and older, 84.6% graduated from high school, 52.6% attended some college, 27.2% earned a bachelor's degree, and 9.6% earned graduate degrees.[468] The basic literacy rate is approximately 99%.[214][469]\nThe United States has many private and public institutions of higher education. There are also local community colleges with generally more open admission policies, shorter academic programs, and lower tuition.[470] The U.S. spends more on education per student than any nation in the world,[471] spending an average of $12,794 per year on public elementary and secondary school students in the 2016\u20132017 school year.[472] As for public expenditures on higher education, the U.S. spends more per student than the OECD average, and more than all nations in combined public and private spending.[473] Despite some student loan forgiveness programs in place,[474] student loan debt has increased by 102% in the last decade,[475] and exceeded 1.7\u00a0trillion dollars as of 2022.[476]\nThe large majority of the world's top universities, as listed by various ranking organizations, are in the United States.[477][478][479] The country also has by far the most Nobel Prize winners in history, with 403 (having won 406 awards).[480]\nIn a preliminary report, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced that U.S. life expectancy at birth had dropped to 76.4 years in 2021 (73.2 years for men and 79.1 years for women), down 0.9 years from 2020. This was the second year of overall decline, and the chief causes listed were the COVID-19 pandemic, accidents, drug overdoses, heart and liver disease, and suicides.[482][483] Life expectancy was highest among Asians and Hispanics and lowest among Blacks and American Indian\u2013Alaskan Native (AIAN) peoples.[484][485] Starting in 1998, the average life expectancy in the U.S. fell behind that of other wealthy industrialized countries, and Americans' \"health disadvantage\" gap has been increasing ever since.[486] The U.S. also has one of the highest suicide rates among high-income countries,[487] and approximately one-third of the U.S. adult population is obese and another third is overweight.[488]\nIn 2010, coronary artery disease, lung cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and traffic collisions caused the most years of life lost in the U.S. Low back pain, depression, musculoskeletal disorders, neck pain, and anxiety caused the most years lost to disability. The most harmful risk factors were poor diet, tobacco smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, physical inactivity, and alcohol consumption. Alzheimer's disease, substance use disorders, kidney disease, cancer, and falls caused the most additional years of life lost over their age-adjusted 1990 per-capita rates.[489] Teenage pregnancy and abortion rates in the U.S. are substantially higher than in other Western nations, especially among blacks and Hispanics.[490]\nThe U.S. health care system far outspends that of any other nation, measured both in per capita spending and as a percentage of GDP but attains worse health care outcomes when compared to peer nations.[491] The United States is the only developed nation without a system of universal health care, and a significant proportion of the population that does not carry health insurance.[492] The U.S., however, is a global leader in medical innovation, measured either in terms of revenue or the number of new drugs and devices introduced.[493][494]\nGovernment-funded health care coverage for the poor (Medicaid, established in 1965) and for those age 65 and older (Medicare, begun in 1966) is available to Americans who meet the programs' income or age qualifications. In 2010, former President Obama passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or ACA,[r][495] which the CDC said that the law roughly halved the uninsured share of the population[496] and multiple studies have concluded that ACA had reduced the mortality of enrollees.[497][498][499] However, its legacy remains controversial.[500]\nAmericans have traditionally been characterized by a unifying belief in an \"American creed\" emphasizing liberty, equality under the law, democracy, social equality, property rights, and a preference for limited government.[502][503] Individualism,[504] having a strong work ethic,[505] competitiveness,[506] and altruism[507][508] are also cited values. According to a 2016 study by the Charities Aid Foundation, Americans donated 1.44% of total GDP to charity, the highest in the world by a large margin.[509] The United States is home to a wide variety of ethnic groups, traditions, and values,[510][511] and exerts major cultural influence on a global scale.[512][513]\nThe Declaration of Independence has become a well-known statement on human rights, particularly its second sentence: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\" Stephen Lucas called it \"one of the best-known sentences in the English language\",[514] with historian Joseph Ellis writing that the document contains \"the most potent and consequential words in American history\".[515] Lincoln considered this passage the foundation of his political philosophy calling it a statement of principles through which the Constitution should be interpreted.[516]:\u200a126\nNearly all present Americans or their ancestors came from Afro-Eurasia within the past five centuries.[517] Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources, such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa.[510][518] More recent immigration from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been described as a homogenizing melting pot, and a heterogeneous salad bowl, with immigrants contributing to, and often assimilating into, mainstream American culture.[510] Nevertheless, there is a high degree of social inequality related to wealth.[371] The American Dream, or the perception that Americans enjoy high social mobility, plays a key role in attracting immigrants.[519] Whether this perception is accurate has been a topic of debate.[520][521][522] While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society,[523] scholars identify significant differences between the country's social classes, affecting socialization, language, and values.[524] Americans tend to greatly value socioeconomic achievement, but being ordinary or average is promoted by some as a noble condition.[525]\nThe United States is considered to have the strongest protections of free speech of any country in the world under the First Amendment,[526] with the Supreme Court ruling that flag desecration, hate speech, blasphemy, and lese-majesty are all forms of protected expression.[527][528][529] A 2016 Pew Research Center poll found that Americans were the most supportive of free expression of any polity measured.[530] They were also found to be the \"most supportive of freedom of the press and the right to use the internet without government censorship.\"[531] It is a socially progressive country[532] with permissive attitudes surrounding human sexuality.[533] LGBT rights in the United States are among the most advanced in the world,[534][533] with public opinion and jurisprudence changing significantly since the late 1980s.[535][536]\nIn the 18th and early 19th centuries, American art and literature took most of their cues from Europe, contributing to Western culture. Writers such as Washington Irving, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe, and Henry David Thoreau established a distinctive American literary voice by the middle of the 19th century. Mark Twain and poet Walt Whitman were major figures in the century's second half; Emily Dickinson, virtually unknown during her lifetime, is recognized as an essential American poet.[537]\nIn the 1920s, the New Negro Movement coalesced in Harlem, where many writers had migrated (some coming from the South, others from the West Indies). Its pan-African perspective was a significant cultural export during the Jazz Age in Paris and as such was a key early influence on the n\u00e9gritude philosophy.[538]\nThere have been a multitude of candidates for the \"Great American Novel\"\u2014works seen as embodying and examining the essence and character of the United States\u2014including Herman Melville's Moby-Dick (1851), Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852), Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885), F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby (1925), John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath (1939), Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird (1960), Toni Morrison's Beloved (1987), and David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest (1996).[539][540][541]\nThirteen U.S. citizens have won the Nobel Prize in Literature, most recently Louise Gl\u00fcck, Bob Dylan, and Toni Morrison.[542] Earlier laureates William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck have also been recognized as influential 20th century writers.[543]\nIn the visual arts, the Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century movement in the tradition of European naturalism. The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an exhibition of European modernist art, shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene.[544] Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, and others experimented with new, individualistic styles.\nMajor artistic movements such as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States. The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought global fame to American architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry.[545] Major photographers include Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, Dorothea Lange, Edward Weston, James Van Der Zee, and Ansel Adams.[546]\nThe United States movie industry has a worldwide influence and following. Hollywood, a northern district of Los Angeles, California, is the leader in motion picture production and the most recognizable movie industry in the world.[547][548][549] The major film studios of the United States are the primary source of the most commercially successful and most ticket selling movies in the world.[550][551]\nThe world's first commercial motion picture exhibition was given in New York City in 1894, using the Kinetoscope.[552] Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around Hollywood, although in the 21st century an increasing number of films are not made there, and film companies have been subject to the forces of globalization.[553] The Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, have been held annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1929,[554] and the Golden Globe Awards have been held annually since January 1944.[555]\nDirector D. W. Griffith, an American filmmaker during the silent film period, was central to the development of film grammar, and producer/entrepreneur Walt Disney was a leader in both animated film and movie merchandising.[556] Directors such as John Ford redefined the image of the American Old West, and, like others such as John Huston, broadened the possibilities of cinema with location shooting. The industry enjoyed its golden years, in what is commonly referred to as the \"Golden Age of Hollywood\", from the early sound period until the early 1960s,[557] with screen actors such as John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe becoming iconic figures.[558][559] In the 1970s, \"New Hollywood\" or the \"Hollywood Renaissance\"[560] was defined by grittier films influenced by French and Italian realist pictures of the post-war period.[561]\nThe 21st century has been marked by the rise of the American streaming platforms, such as Netflix, Disney+, Paramount+, and Apple TV+, which came to rival traditional cinema.[562][563]\nMainstream theater in the United States derives from the old European theatrical tradition and has been heavily influenced by the British theater.[564] The central hub of the American theater scene has been Manhattan, with its divisions of Broadway, off-Broadway, and off-off-Broadway.[565] Many movie and television stars have gotten their big break working in New York productions. Outside New York City, many cities have professional regional or resident theater companies that produce their own seasons, with some works being produced regionally with hopes of eventually moving to New York. The biggest-budget theatrical productions are musicals. U.S. theater also has an active community theater culture, which relies mainly on local volunteers who may not be actively pursuing a theatrical career.[566]\nAmerican folk music encompasses numerous music genres, variously known as traditional music, traditional folk music, contemporary folk music, or roots music. Many traditional songs have been sung within the same family or folk group for generations, and sometimes trace back to such origins as the British Isles, Mainland Europe, or Africa.[567]\nAmong America's earliest composers was a man named William Billings who, born in Boston, composed patriotic hymns in the 1770s;[568] Billings was a part of the First New England School, who dominated American music during its earliest stages. Anthony Heinrich was the most prominent composer before the Civil War. From the mid- to late 1800s, John Philip Sousa of the late Romantic era composed numerous military songs\u2014particularly marches\u2014and is regarded as one of America's greatest composers.[569]\nThe rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music have significantly influenced American music at large, distinguishing it from European and African traditions. The Smithsonian Institution states, \"African-American influences are so fundamental to American music that there would be no American music without them.\"[570] Country music developed in the 1920s, and rhythm and blues in the 1940s. Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and what is known as old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences. Jazz was developed by innovators such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington early in the 20th century.[571]\nKnown world-wide and singing in a wide variety of genres, Aretha Franklin is widely considered to be the all-time greatest American singer.[572]\nElvis Presley and Chuck Berry were among the pioneers of rock and roll in the mid-1950s. Rock bands such as Metallica, the Eagles, and Aerosmith are among the highest grossing in worldwide sales.[573][574][575] In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of America's most celebrated songwriters.[576] Mid-20th-century American pop stars such as Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra,[577] and Elvis Presley became global celebrities,[571] as have artists of the late 20th century such as Prince, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Whitney Houston, and Mariah Carey.[578][579] American professional opera singers have reached the highest level of success in that form, including Ren\u00e9e Fleming, Leontyne Price, Beverly Sills, Nelson Eddy, and many others.[580]\nAmerican popular music, as part of the wider U.S. pop culture, has a worldwide influence and following.[581]\nThe four major broadcasters in the U.S. are the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), American Broadcasting Company (ABC), and Fox Broadcasting Company (FOX). The four major broadcast television networks are all commercial entities. Cable television offers hundreds of channels catering to a variety of niches.[583] As of 2021[update], about 83% of Americans over age 12 listen to broadcast radio, while about 41% listen to podcasts.[584] As of September\u00a030, 2014[update], there are 15,433 licensed full-power radio stations in the U.S. according to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC).[585] Much of the public radio broadcasting is supplied by NPR, incorporated in February 1970 under the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967.[586]\nInternationally well-known U.S. newspapers include The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, and USA Today.[587] More than 800 publications are produced in Spanish, the second most commonly used language in the United States behind English.[588][589] With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned, either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy, which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or, in a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families. Major cities often have alternative newspapers to complement the mainstream daily papers, such as New York City's The Village Voice or Los Angeles' LA Weekly. The five most popular websites used in the U.S. are Google, YouTube, Amazon, Yahoo, and Facebook, with all of them being American companies.[590]\nWidely regarded as the birthplace of the modern video gaming industry,[591] the United States is the world's second-largest video game market by revenue.[592] Major publishers headquartered in the United States are Sony Interactive Entertainment, Take-Two, Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, Xbox Game Studios, Bethesda Softworks, Epic Games, Valve, Warner Bros., Riot Games, and others.[593][594] There are 444 publishers, developers, and hardware companies in California alone.[595]\nEarly settlers were introduced by Native Americans to such indigenous, non-European foods as turkey, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup. They and later immigrants combined these with foods they had known, such as wheat flour,[596] beef, and milk to create a distinctive American cuisine.[597][598] Homegrown foods are part of a shared national menu on one of America's most popular holidays, Thanksgiving, when many Americans make or purchase traditional foods to celebrate the occasion.[599]\nThe American fast food industry, the world's largest,[600] pioneered the drive-through format in the 1940s.[601] Characteristic American dishes such as apple pie, fried chicken, doughnuts, french fries, macaroni and cheese, ice cream, pizza, hamburgers, and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrants.[602][603] Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos and pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are widely consumed.[604]\nAmericans drink three times as much coffee as tea.[605] Marketing by U.S. industries is largely responsible for making orange juice and milk standard breakfast beverages.[606][607]\nAmerican chefs have been influential both in the food industry and in popular culture. Some important 19th-century American chefs include Charles Ranhofer of Delmonico's Restaurant in New York. Later, chefs Charles Scotto, Louis Pacquet, John Massironi founded the American Culinary Federation in 1930, taking after similar organizations across Europe. In the 1940s, Chef James Beard hosted the first nationally televised cooking show I Love to Eat. His name is also carried by the foundation and prestigious cooking award recognizing excellence in the American cooking community.[608][self-published source?] Since Beard, many chefs and cooking personalities have taken to television, and the success of the Cooking Channel and Food Network have contributed to the popularity of American cuisine. Probably the best-known television chef was Julia Child who taught French cuisine in her weekly show, The French Chef. In 1946, the Culinary Institute of America was founded by Katharine Angell and Frances Roth. This would become the United States' most prestigious culinary school, where many of the most talented American chefs would study prior to successful careers.[609][self-published source?]\nThe most popular spectator sports in the U.S. are American football, basketball, baseball, soccer, and ice hockey, according to a 2017 Gallup poll.[610] While most major U.S. sports such as baseball and American football have evolved out of European practices, basketball, volleyball, skateboarding, and snowboarding are American inventions, some of which have become popular worldwide.[611] Lacrosse and surfing arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate European contact.[612] The market for professional sports in the United States was roughly $69\u00a0billion in July 2013, roughly 50% larger than that of all of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined.[613]\nAmerican football is by several measures the most popular spectator sport in the United States;[614] the National Football League (NFL) has the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world, and the Super Bowl is watched by tens of millions globally.[615] Baseball has been regarded as the U.S. national sport since the late 19th century, with Major League Baseball being the top league. Basketball and ice hockey are the country's next two most popular professional team sports, with the top leagues being the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League, which are also the premier leagues worldwide for these sports. The most-watched individual sports in the U.S. are golf and auto racing, particularly NASCAR and IndyCar.[616][617] On the collegiate level, earnings for the member institutions exceed $1 billion annually,[618] and college football and basketball attract large audiences, as the NCAA Final Four is one of the most watched national sporting events.[619]\nEight Olympic Games have taken place in the United States. The 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri, were the first-ever Olympic Games held outside of Europe.[620] The Olympic Games will be held in the U.S. for a ninth time when Los Angeles hosts the 2028 Summer Olympics. U.S. athletes have won a total of 2,959 medals (1,173 gold) at the Olympic Games, by far the most of any country.[621][622][623][624] Unlike most other nations, the United States government does not provide funding for sports nor for the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee.[625][626][627][628]\nIn soccer, the men's national soccer team qualified for eleven World Cups, while the women's national team has won the FIFA Women's World Cup and Olympic soccer tournament four times each.[629] The United States hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup and will host the 2026 FIFA World Cup along with Canada and Mexico.[630]\nInternet sources\nCoordinates: 40\u00b0N 100\u00b0W\ufeff / \ufeff40\u00b0N 100\u00b0W\ufeff / 40; -100\ufeff (United States of America)", "links":

States - Wikipedia": {"text": "Pizza arrived in the United States in the early 20th century along with waves of Italian immigrants who settled primarily in the large cities of the Northeast. It got a boost both in popularity and regional spread after soldiers stationed in Italy returned from World War II.[1]\nDuring the latter half of the 20th century, pizza became an iconic dish of considerable acceptance in the United States. Numerous regional variations have evolved, with many bearing only a casual resemblance to the Italian original. It is a popular fast food item produced by several pizza chains. The United States pizza restaurant industry was worth $37 billion in 2015.[2][3]\nThe first pizzeria in the U.S., Lombardi's,[4] opened in New York City's Little Italy in 1905,[5] producing a Neapolitan-style pizza.\nDistinct regional types developed in the 20th century, including Buffalo,[6] California, Chicago, Detroit, Greek, New Haven, New York, and St. Louis styles.[7] These regional variations include deep-dish, stuffed, pockets, turnovers, rolls, and pizza-on-a-stick, each with several combinations of sauce and toppings.\nThirteen percent of the United States population consumes pizza on any given day.[8] Tens of thousands of pizzerias, food stands, chains such as Domino's, Pizza Hut, and Papa John's, pies from take and bake shops, and chilled or frozen pizzas from supermarkets make pizza readily available both to diners and at-home consumers nationwide.\nCommon toppings for pizza in the United States include pepperoni, mushrooms, olives, onions, peppers, sausage, ground beef, bacon, chicken, ham, pineapple, salami, spinach, tomatoes, and anchovies.\nAmerican pizza (particularly thin-crust) is made with a very high-gluten flour (often 13\u201314% protein content) of the type also used to make bagels; this allows the dough to be stretched thinly and thrown vigorously without tearing. Unlike Italian pizza,[10] American pizza often has vegetable oil or shortening mixed into the dough. This can range from a small amount in relatively lean doughs, such as New York style, to a very large amount in some recipes for Chicago-style deep-dish dough.[citation needed]\nWhile tomato sauce is virtually ubiquitous, variations such as white pizza omit it while others replace it with garlic and olive oil or sauces made from other vegetables such as pesto.", "links":

As members of the United States Senate, we believe in working closely with our partners to overcome the most difficult political and economic hurdles of our time. In Latin America, the United States has many such strong allies, with Colombia top among them.\nFor decades, the United States and Colombia have built a solid partnership based on mutual respect, cooperation, and common goals. This alliance has safeguarded the economic, security, and geopolitical interests of our nation, while also advancing Colombia\u2019s path to increased stability, prosperity, and regional leadership. With Colombia\u2019s transformations, the United States stands to reap the benefits of this vital relationship and further work with Colombia to help solve hemispheric challenges.\nWe must build upon our bilateral successes to ensure sustainable prosperity in the years to come. Colombia faces strong headwinds that require renewed US attention: ensuring the effective implementation of the Colombian peace accords, securing resources to continue providing assistance for Venezuelan migrants and refugees, and mitigating ongoing security threats. By further investing in the US-Colombia relationship, the United States and the US Congress can provide new momentum for the hemisphere.\nThis report lays out a modernized plan for the bilateral relationship. It builds on the successes of Plan Colombia and provides a roadmap for continued, strengthened, and transformative USColombia engagement. The report follows the work of the Atlantic Council\u2019s US-Colombia Task Force, a group of current and former policymakers, including colleagues in the House of Representatives, business executives, and civil society leaders from both Colombia and the United States. As co-chairs of the Task Force, we are confident the recommendations outlined in the following pages will help advance US interests, contribute to peace and prosperity in Colombia, and promote regional stability.\nThis is a moment of great promise for the US-Colombia relationship. A more peaceful and prosperous Colombia not only translates to a more secure United States, but also to a more stable Western Hemisphere. We hope the work of this Task Force will help underscore the importance of a deepened and modernized US-Colombia alliance and set the stage for a new era of successful bilateral collaboration.\nThe multisectoral, bipartisan, bicameral, and bilateral nature of the task force allowed us to develop concrete, fresh, and actionable proposals that will help guide US and Colombian policymakers going forward. We identified three major areas of engagement: economic development and innovation; rule of law, institutional control, counternarcotics; and joint regional leadership. A strengthened US-Colombia partnership along these pillars will pay dividends on US investments far beyond our national borders.\nSenator Roy Blunt (R-MO)Task Force Co-Chair\nSenator Ben Cardin (D-MD)Task Force Co-Chair\nExecutive summary\nReturn to table of contents\ufeff\nColombia is one of the United States\u2019s closest allies in the Western Hemisphere. For decades, both nations consolidated a mutually beneficial partnership that successfully safeguarded US and Colombian national security interests. Today, with increased interconnectedness, both nations\u2019 security, economic, and geopolitical interests are more intertwined than ever before.\nColombia\u2019s transition into a more peaceful and prosperous democracy makes it imperative that the United States and Colombia seize this moment to expand and deepen the partnership. The findings presented in the following pages require urgent attention. Although Colombia is a different country than it was two decades ago, new challenges with peace accord implementation and Colombia\u2019s role as the top receiving country of Venezuelan migrants and refugees make finding new ways to work together crucial \u2014 Colombia\u2019s success is the United States\u2019 success.\nThis report provides a blueprint for a modernized US-Colombia strategic partnership. It is the product of a nonpartisan, bicameral, multisector, and bicountry task force launched in March 2019 by the Atlantic Council\u2019s Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center. Composed of high-level business executives, current and former policymakers, and civil society leaders from Colombia and the United States, the task force offers concrete, actionable, and fresh proposals on how to strengthen the bilateral relationship. The ideas are intended to provide guidance to both the Colombian and US administrations, the US Congress, and the respective business communities on opportunities to maximize the full potential of the US-Colombia relationship.  Task force recommendations are divided into three categories: sustainable economic development; rule of law, rural development, and counternarcotics efforts; and joint leadership around the Venezuela regional crisis.\nTapping the full potential of the US-Colombia partnership must include the promotion of economic development. A healthy Colombian economy directly serves US national security interests as it contributes to rural development, which is critical to undermine the drug trade and other illicit economic activities as well as illegal armed actors. Fully implementing all aspects of the US-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement (TPA) and endorsing the double taxation agreement will lead to deepened bilateral trade and investment.\nThis report serves as a blueprint for addressing the challenges and responses that would strengthen US national security and regional stability.\nU.S. President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump stand with Colombian President Ivan Duque and his wife Maria Juliana Ruiz after their arrival at the White House in Washington, U.S., February 13, 2019. REUTERS/Carlos Barria\nThe task force identified Colombia\u2019s taxation system and high levels of informality as two major barriers to economic development. The partnership can include collaboration to modernize Colombia\u2019s taxation agency and reduce informality. Further digitalizing Colombia\u2019s economy, simplifying processes for firm creation and closure, improving access to credit and other business services, setting corporate taxes at levels similar to those of other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, and making labor regulations more flexible, will all help to incentivize the formal (or licit) economy and undermine informality. Advances in innovation, science, technology, and education are also crucial to achieve the economic development needed to combat illegal armed groups and reduce coca production and cocaine trafficking.\nAdvancing shared US and Colombian security interests requires the stabilization of territories where coca crops are cultivated, illicit armed actors operate, and local populations face high levels of violence and poverty. Critical to regaining control of rural areas is implementation of the Peace Agreement with the FARC. The task force recognizes the need for a long-term, adequately resourced intervention strategy that includes security, justice, formalization of land property rights, education, public goods provision, and economic opportunities in priority areas to dismantle organized armed groups, eradicate rising coca crops, and fight drug trafficking. If a successful, multidimensional intervention plan is implemented in ten municipalities, the US-Colombia partnership will disrupt the conditions that favor illegality in territories responsible for almost half the entire national coca production. Colombia and the United States should promote partnerships between both countries\u2019 private sector and civil society to develop market-driven, large-scale and holistic rural development projects in coordination with the Colombian government.\nSafeguarding US and Colombian security interests also requires enhancing rural connectivity in Colombia, addressing the world drug problem, and protecting Colombian social leaders and human rights defenders. Rural infrastructure stands as a prerequisite to rural economic growth and the success of crop substitution programs. Unless farmers can get their legal products to market, no eradication effort will prove sustainable in the long run. Colombia and the United States can work together to replicate successful projects involving local populations in the building and maintenance of secondary and tertiary roads, with the long-term goal of creating capacity for future infrastructure projects in the locality. To address the world drug problem in an integral way, the US-Colombia partnership should not only aim to reduce coca crops in the short run but also continue to target other stages of the drug market, including cocaine production, trafficking, and consumption.\nThe United States and Colombia share a firm commitment to human rights and should therefore continue to collaborate to end the rising levels of violence against social leaders and human rights defenders in Colombia. The United States can support Colombia\u2019s current efforts by providing financial assistance for President Duque\u2019s Timely Action Plan on Prevention and Protection for Human Rights Defenders, Social Leaders, and Journalists (PAO). Colombia, in turn, should develop a progress report for the PAO with clear follow-up mechanisms that involves civil society organizations in the process.\nThe political, economic, and humanitarian crisis in Venezuela is a threat to regional stability. Colombia has demonstrated commendable solidarity in receiving over 1.4 million Venezuelan migrants and refugees \u2013 a number that will continue to grow in the coming months and years. The United States should increase its financial, diplomatic, and technical support to Colombia as it plays a leadership role in addressing the crisis. If current international support does not increase, Colombia runs the risk of spiraling into economic stagnation, violence, criminality, illicit economies, and decayed governance. This will not only harm US national security and geopolitical interests but will lead to major economic losses to previous and current US investment in Colombia. The United States can further support its ally by enhancing the Colombian government\u2019s capacity to gather and process data on Venezuelan migrants and refugees entering the country and by contributing to border control through monitoring technologies. The US-Colombia partnership can also create a task force to calculate the fiscal impact of the crisis to Colombia to understand the exact level of funding that will be required to absorb the growing number of Venezuelans. In addition, the partnership can support the efforts of the Venezuelan interim government by convening a group of experts on stabilization of territories and transitions to democracy that can provide it with intelligence cooperation and guidance on the promotion of rule of law and strengthening of national institutions.\nThe US-Colombia partnership is one of the greatest US foreign policy successes over the last two decades. Dedicated, sustained, bipartisan commitment to achieving common goals, once thought to be out of reach, was possible due to US congressional leadership and a commitment to work across US administrations. At the same time, successive Colombian governments showed themselves to be critical partners for the United States\u2014both in-country and beyond its borders. But we cannot rest on our laurels. New domestic and regional paradigms make this moment imperative to define how our relationship can and should be taken to the next level.\nReturn to table of contents\ufeff\nReturn to table of contents\ufeff\nColombia is one of the United States\u2019 strongest, most reliable allies in the Western Hemisphere. It collaborates with the United States in fighting international drug trafficking and transnational organized crime, as well as in promoting democracy, rule of law, and economic prosperity in the region. At the United Nations (UN), among other things, Colombia supports US diplomatic efforts on priorities such as North Korea, Syria, Iran, and Ukraine. It also contributes security expertise in Central America, Afghanistan, and a number of countries in Africa. Colombia is NATO\u2019s only global partner in Latin America, one of the two Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member countries in South America, and a regional leader in facing the crisis in Venezuela. Here, its generous response to the massive influx of Venezuelan migrants and refugees should be viewed as a model for countries around the world.\nWith the US-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement (TPA), the opportunities for mutually beneficial trade are enormous. The United States is Colombia\u2019s largest trading partner and Colombia is the United States\u2019 third-largest export market in Latin America behind Mexico and Brazil.1Embassy of Colombia, \u201cColombia and the United States: A Successful Trade Alliance,\u201d https://www.colombiaemb.org/TradeAlliance. Today, with increasing hemispheric challenges, the US-Colombia strategic partnership is more important than ever. By continuing to invest in the already strong bilateral relationship, both countries stand to benefit in the short, medium, and long term.\nColombia is pivotal in addressing Venezuela\u2019s unprecedented political and economic crisis, which has led to the largest mass migration in Latin American history. With 1.4 million Venezuelan migrants in its territory as of June 2019, Colombia is the primary destination for Venezuelans.2\u201cVenezolanos en Colombia,\u201d Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores \u2013 Gobierno de Colombia, August 1, 2019, http://migracioncolombia.gov.co/index.php/es/prensa/infografias/infografias-2019/12565-infografia-venezolanos-en-colombia. President Iv\u00e1n Duque has adopted a policy of complete solidarity toward Venezuelan migrants,3El Consejo Nacional de Pol\u00edtica Econ\u00f3mica y Social (CONPES), \u201cEstrategia Para La Atenci\u00f3n de la Migraci\u00f3n desde Venezuela,\u201d November 23, 2018, https://colaboracion.dnp.gov.co/CDT/Conpes/Econ\u00f3micos/3950.pdf. providing medical care, housing and public education, among other services. According to the World Bank, the estimated economic cost for Colombia in 2018, not including infrastructure and facilities, reached 0.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), or the equivalent of $1.5 billion.4The World Bank, \u201cUS$31.5 Million to Help Improve Services for Migrants from Venezuela and Host Communities in Colombia,\u201d April 12, 2019, https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2019/04/12/us315-million-to-help-improve-services-for-migrants-from-venezuela-and-host-communities-in-colombia.\nToday, with increasing hemispheric challenges, the US-Colombia strategic partnership is more important than ever.\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo (right) and Colombian Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo speak with reporters before their meeting at the US State Department in Washington in 2019. Deepened US-Colombia collaboration in areas of economic development, security, and regional stability will further advance mutual interests. (Reuters/Yuri Gripas)\nColombia has also sought to confront increased illegal activity in Venezuela, including illegal mining, the arms and drug trade, and human trafficking, as well as the smuggling of goods and money laundering. Here, a contradiction exists around the role of China. At the same time that China is increasing its economic ties with Latin America\u2014and while Colombia\u2019s exports to China increased 83 percent in 2018 compared with 2017\u2014it continues to support the Maduro regime, helping to maintain a criminal enterprise in Venezuela that directly threatens Colombia\u2019s interests. As the presence of guerrilla groups, drug cartels, and other transnational criminal organizations in Venezuela5\u201cELN in Venezuela,\u201d InSight Crime, March 11, 2019, https://www.insightcrime.org/venezuela-organized-crime-news/eln-in-venezuela/. creates new security challenges for the region, Colombia\u2019s role in maintaining regional stability becomes more vital than ever. Eventual reconstruction efforts in Venezuela will also require enormous Colombian support.\nIn addition to its partnership with the United States in the region, Colombia plays a unique role in tackling the world drug problem, as also stated in the Global Call to Action by President Donald Trump at the 2018 United Nations General Assembly. Colombia has the most to lose if the fight against drugs is unsuccessful, and it has thus advanced a full-on strategy to disrupt the cocaine trade. The United States has been a crucial ally in this quest. Since Plan Colombia was announced in 1999, the United States has provided more than $11 billion6Congressional Research Service, \u201cColombia: Background and U.S. Relations,\u201d February 8, 2019, https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R43813.pdf. to aid the Colombian government in strengthening state capacity and institutions, decreasing coca crops, and fighting the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and other illegal groups that profited from drug trafficking. Colombia has contributed more than 95 percent of the total investment in Plan Colombia.7Direcci\u00f3n de Justicia, Seguridad y Gobierno (DJSG) and Direcci\u00f3n de Seguimiento y Evaluaci\u00f3n de Pol\u00edticas P\u00fablicas (DSEPP), \u201cPlan Colombia: Balance de los 15 a\u00f1os,\u201d Departamento Nacional de Planeaci\u00f3n \u2013 Government of Colombia, 2016, https://sinergia.dnp.gov.co/Documentospercent20depercent20Interes/PLAN_COLOMBIA_Boletin_180216.pdf.\nBetween 2001 and 2016, the country destroyed 37,504 illegal laboratories, seized an average of 181,201 kilograms of cocaine each year, and reduced the area containing coca crops by half in the first six years.8United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), \u201cColombia \u2013 Monitoreo de territorios afectados por cultivos il\u00edcitos 2016,\u201d July 2017, https://www.unodc.org/documents/colombia/2017/julio/CENSO_2017_WEB_baja.pdf. Colombia has also made enormous sacrifices in terms of lives lost: between 2009 and 2018, 126 members of the state security forces as well as civilians died in eradication missions and 664 were wounded.9Juan Carlos Garz\u00f3n Vergara, Juan David Gelvez F., and \u00c1ngela Mar\u00eda Silva Aparicio, \u201cLos costos humanos de la erradicaci\u00f3n forzada \u00bfes el glifosato la soluci\u00f3n?,\u201d Fundaci\u00f3n Ideas Para la Paz, March 7, 2019, http://www.ideaspaz.org/publications/posts/1734. Overall, during the first fifteen years of Plan Colombia, about six million people\u2014including members of the state forces, combatants of illegal groups, and, mostly, civilians\u2014were victims of a violent event such as forced displacement, homicide, or kidnapping.10Red Nacional de Informaci\u00f3n, \u201cInicio,\u201d Unidad Victimas \u2013 Government of Colombia, August 1, 2019, https://cifras.unidadvictimas.gov.co/. By 2017, and after decades of enormous efforts, successive governments in Colombia had advanced in dismantling the most significant drug cartels, reached agreements to demobilize several paramilitary forces, and started the implementation of the Peace Accords with the FARC. In 2017, the country achieved the lowest homicide rate in its past forty-two years.11\u201cHomicidios en Colombia: La tasa m\u00e1s baja en los \u00faltimos 42 a\u00f1os se dio en 2017,\u201d El Espectador, January 21, 2018, https://www.elespectador.com/noticias/judicial/homicidios-en-colombia-la-tasa-mas-baja-en-los-ultimos-42-anos-se-dio-en-2017-articulo-734526.\nIn 2019, the UN Security Council, following its mission visit to Colombia in July, called Colombia\u2019s ability to negotiate a peace agreement in 2016 \u201can example for others around the world.\u201d12United Nations Security Council, \u201cSecurity Council Press Statement on Colombia,\u201d July 23, 2019, https://www.un.org/press/en/2019/sc13896.doc.htm. The Council also \u201cwelcomed Government efforts to advance the reintegration of former FARC-EP members and strengthen rural development\u201d and stressed the importance of \u201cimplementing the peace agreement as an interlocking set of commitments.\u201d13United Nations Security Council, \u201cSecurity Council Press Statement on Colombia.\u201d\nHowever, several challenges to Colombia\u2019s national security and democracy as well as the rights of its citizens still remain. These challenges are partially explained by the capacity of existing illegal armed groups and criminal organizations to adapt and take advantage of conditions that favor their growth\u2014i.e., insufficient institutional presence, limited economic opportunities, and the availability of illegal funding sources. After the demobilization of the FARC, several armed groups competed for territorial control in areas where the guerrilla group used to operate. A vacuum had been left for them to exploit and profit from illicit economies such as drug trafficking, illegal mining, and extortion.14El Tiempo, \u201cEstos son los grupos armados que azotan a varios departamentos,\u201d July 23, 2019, https://www.eltiempo.com/colombia/otras-ciudades/regiones-del-pais-afectadas-por-grupos-armados-en-colombia-391642.\nThe rights of vulnerable populations in areas where the state is fragile therefore remain unprotected. According to Colombia\u2019s Victims Unit, more than 360,000 people were internally displaced between January 2016 and July 2019.15Red Nacional de Informaci\u00f3n, \u201cDesplazamiento \u2013 Personas: Registro Unico de Victimas,\u201d Unidad Victimas \u2013 Government of Colombia, August 1, 2019, https://cifras.unidadvictimas.gov.co/Home/Desplazamiento. The situation of social leaders is particularly critical\u2014more than 300 have been killed since 2016.16Jos\u00e9 David Rodr\u00edguez G\u00f3mez, \u201cM\u00e1s de 317 l\u00edderes sociales han sido asesinados en el \u00faltimo a\u00f1o: Medicina Legal,\u201d RCN Radio, May 15, 2019, https://www.rcnradio.com/colombia/mas-de-317-lideres-sociales-han-sido-asesinados-en-el-ultimo-ano-medicina-legal. Corruption, which President Duque has identified as a top priority (and recently submitted legislation to counter it), has facilitated criminal activities and undermines the legitimacy of the Colombian state. At the same time, while there has been progress in the implementation of the Peace Accords, there is still a long way to go to achieve the accords\u2019 stated goals and commitments. Additionally, instability in Venezuela and the meddling of Russia, in particular, contributes to new security challenges.\nDeepening Colombia\u2019s alliances with the United States in security and economic issues is of paramount importance for both countries to achieve their common goals.\nThese problems do not only affect Colombia: They also directly compromise US goals. A new US-Colombia partnership can better address the structural conditions that favor illicit activities, thus reducing the flow of cocaine to the United States. The two countries can also deepen cooperation to help governments in Central America, Mexico, and South America confront transnational criminal organizations, drawing on Colombia\u2019s experience as a leader in addressing regional security issues.\nDeepening Colombia\u2019s alliances with the United States in security and economic issues is of paramount importance for both countries to achieve their common goals. The terms of this partnership must originate with a long-term plan to effectively transform the conditions that currently favor illegality and enable the production and trafficking of cocaine but then move to a long-term vision that fully maximizes the relationship and Colombia\u2019s regional role. This commitment to an even more robust, long-term strategic alliance will set Colombia on a path for sustainable growth and ensure that both countries\u2019 interests are mutually reinforcing.\nThis report outlines the main areas for US-Colombia cooperation that the Atlantic Council\u2019s US-Colombia Task Force identified to advance US and Colombia interests while fostering a more secure and prosperous Western Hemisphere.\nReturn to table of contents\ufeff\nColombia is in a period of momentous transition. It is rapidly consolidating its role as a key player in Latin America and an indispensable partner for the United States on many fronts. Simultaneously, the United States has become an important source of political and economic support for Colombia, making it imperative to deepen ties between the two countries at this critical time in Colombia\u2019s history. Colombia must not only ensure that peace is in fact achieved, but also grapple with the external and internal challenges that arise from the worsening of the crisis in Venezuela. US economic, humanitarian, and security assistance to Colombia, as well as continued bipartisan support, is thus vital for the long-term interests of Colombia and the United States.\nThe Atlantic Council\u2019s Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center launched its US-Colombia Task Force to create the foundation for a new plan of action vis-\u00e0-vis the US-Colombia economic and diplomatic relationship. This distinguished group built on the recommendations of the Atlantic Council\u2019s 2017 Colombia Task Force, which provided the Trump administration with a blueprint for US engagement with Colombia. This refocused and expanded US-Colombia Task Force provides a roadmap for the Duque administration, the Trump administration, and the US Congress on how to deepen and expand the relationship along three pillars: economic development; strengthening institutions and rule of law, promoting rural development, and tackling the world drug problem; and Colombia\u2019s leadership in the context of the Venezuela regional crisis.\nThe task force is co-chaired by Senator Roy Blunt (R-Missouri) and Senator Ben Cardin (D-Maryland). Senator Blunt serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee and Senator Cardin is a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. In addition to bipartisan leadership, members include a bipartisan grouping from the US House of Representatives: Congressman Bradley Byrne (R-Alabama); Congressman Ruben Gallego (D-Arizona); Congressman Gregory Meeks (D-New York); and Congressman Francis Rooney (R-Florida). The task force also includes former policymakers from and leaders in business and civil society in both the United States and Colombia, who provide expert insight to help guide the leaders of both countries in advancing the next chapter of the US-Colombia relationship. The task force is a truly nonpartisan, bicameral, binational working group with a wide reach and the foundation to create impact for years to come.\nReturn to table of contents\ufeff\nThe United States and Colombia have consolidated a close and mutually beneficial partnership over the past decades. Plan Colombia, announced in 1999 and sustained by US leaders of both political parties, laid the foundation for a strategic alliance that has widened to include sustainable development, trade and investment, hemispheric security, human rights, and other areas of cooperation. Plan Colombia has been one of the United States\u2019 most successful foreign policy initiatives in the past 20 years. Its success is visible today in Colombia\u2019s positive transformations and the safeguarding of vital US interests. As former National Security Advisor Stephen J. Hadley, who served under President George W. Bush and is now executive vice chair of the Atlantic Council, said, \u201cPlan Colombia is an example of a visionary, bipartisan strategic framework that has supported the Colombian people and government as they have transformed Colombia into a peaceful democracy.\u201d17Atlantic Council, \u201cA Roadmap for US Engagement with Colombia,\u201d May 2017, https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/images/publications/A_Roadmap_for_US_Engagement_with_Colombia_web_0517.pdf.\nAlthough Colombian taxpayer funds financed almost 95 percent of the total investment in Plan Colombia, US political leadership, military and police training, and technology assistance were crucial to the success of this bipartisan foreign policy initiative. US investment in Plan Colombia totals $11 billion, with $10 billion provided between 2000 and 2016\u2014a number that represents less than 2 percent of the cost of the Iraq war over the same period.18Congressional Research Service, \u201cThe Cost of Iraq, Afghanistan, and Other Global War on Terror Operations Since 9/11\u201d (2014), https://fas.org/sgp/ crs/natsec/RL33110.pdf. A strong return on US investment is evident. In those same years, Colombia significantly strengthened its institutional capacity and made notable progress combating drug trafficking, fighting illegal armed groups, and securing government control of territories. Additionally, Colombia\u2019s liberalized economy quadrupled in size, poverty and homicides fell by more than 50 percent, and kidnappings were reduced by 90 percent.19Miguel Silva, \u201cPath to Peace and Prosperity: The Colombian Miracle,\u201d Atlantic Council, 2015, http:// publications.atlanticcouncil.org/colombia-miracle/; United States Senate, \u201cS.Res.368 \u2013 A resolution supporting efforts by the Government of Colombia to pursue peace and the end of the country\u2019s enduring internal armed conflict and recognizing United States support for Colombia at the 15th anniversary of Plan Colombia,\u201d 2016, https://www. congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senateresolution/368/text. With its improved security situation and strengthened democratic institutions, Colombia transitioned from being an aid recipient to a strategic ally of the United States and an exporter of security and political leadership in the region.\nThe successor strategy to Plan Colombia, Peace Colombia, was announced by President Barack Obama in February 2016. This multiyear initiative sought to scale up vital US support to help Colombia \u201cwin the peace,\u201d in the event of a peace agreement with the FARC.20The White House, \u201cRemarks by President Obama and President Santos of Colombia at Plan Colombia Reception,\u201d February 4, 2016, https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/02/05/remarks-president-obama-and-president-santos-colombia-plan-colombia; The White House, \u201cFact Sheet: Peace Colombia \u2014 A New Era of Partnership between the United States and Colombia,\u201d February 4, 2016, https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/02/04/fact-sheet-peace-colombia-new-era-partnership-between-united-states-and. Less than five months later, a peace agreement was signed. Peace Colombia was designed to consolidate Plan Colombia\u2019s security gains; advance counternarcotics efforts; reintegrate former combatants into society; expand state presence and institutions, especially in territories most affected by violence; provide titles and access to land for poor farmers; and promote justice and economic opportunities for Colombians.21The White House, \u201cFact Sheet: Peace Colombia \u2014 A New Era of Partnership between the United States and Colombia.\u201d As with Plan Colombia, Colombian taxpayers were expected to fund close to 90 percent of the total budget for the initiative. In fiscal year (FY) 2018, the US Congress approved an omnibus appropriations measure funding Peace Colombia programs at $391 million.22Congressional Research Service, \u201cColombia: Background and U.S. Relations.\u201d Although President Trump\u2019s FY 2019 budget request for Colombia was $265 million (a 32 percent reduction from the $391 million appropriated by congress in FY 2018), the 2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act provided Colombia \u201cno less than\u201d $418 million in funding.23Peter J. Meyer, and Edward Y. Gracia, \u201cU.S. Foreign Assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean: FY2019 Appropriations,\u201d Congressional Research Service, March 1, 2019, https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R45547.pdf. This additional assistance has a focus on drug eradication and interdiction efforts as well as rural security. For FY 2020, the administration requested $344 million in funding for Colombia.24Congressional Budget Justification, \u201cDepartment of State, Foreign Operations, And Related Programs: Fiscal Year 2020,\u201d May 22, 2019, https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Supplementary-Tables-%E2%80%93-Foreign-Operations.pdf. Continued and deepened US assistance to Colombia is more important than ever as Colombia receives a growing number of Venezuelan migrants and refugees and continues to work toward the implementation of the 2016 peace agreement. A stable and prosperous Colombia will safeguard US national security, economic, and geopolitical interests in the region, generating a strong return on US investment.\nColombia\u2019s cooperation with NATO started in 2013. Four years later, the Individual Partnership and Cooperation Program (IPCP) made Colombia NATO\u2019s first and only global partner in Latin America and the ninth in the world, alongside Afghanistan, Australia, Iraq, Japan, South Korea, Mongolia, New Zealand, and Pakistan. As a NATO partner, Colombia has access to and engages in various organization activities ranging from trainings and education to military exercises.\nGiven the challenges it has faced over the past five decades as well as its leading role in security and defense cooperation in Central and South America, Colombia has significant contributions to make to NATO and the global community. For example, the country recently started participating in the Science for Peace and Security Program, and was invited to a research workshop in Denmark this year, focusing on counterterrorism lessons from maritime piracy and narcotic interdiction. In addition, Colombia\u2019s International Demining Centre (CIDES) joined the network of NATO Partnership Training and Education Centers in March 2019. CIDES will contribute to the education and training of personnel from NATO nations and partners in the crucial areas of humanitarian procedures and military demining. Colombia and NATO plan to develop common approaches in supporting peace and security efforts. Under this same program, Colombia and NATO are working on the implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1325 on Women, Peace and Security, as well as protecting children and civilians in armed conflict.\nAt the same time, the IPCP will benefit Colombia, allowing it to access cooperation and training programs. The agreement is expected to improve the country\u2019s humanitarian operations, rescue missions, crisis management, and security collaboration for civil emergencies, as well as inform its fight against terrorism, cybersecurity, and organized crime. It also is expected to help export Colombia\u2019s experience, an added value for the Alliance. The program will reinforce both political dialogue and interoperability with the armed forces of partner countries. The US Congress can further support Colombia\u2019s role by advocating for Colombia to become a non-NATO ally.\nColombia also is advancing its participation in UN peacekeeping missions. The Colombian Armed Forces are training service members who will join UN forces to help countries in conflict achieve peace. Trainees will take courses on human rights, international humanitarian law, and UN Peacekeeping Operations commands and doctrine, while at the same time learning about the culture of the countries of placement.25Myriam Ortega, \u201cColombia Boosts Peace Missions Participation,\u201d Di\u00e1logo, February 12, 2018, https://dialogo-americas.com/en/articles/colombia-boosts-peace-missions-participation.\nColombia is a strategic partner for the United States and its success in combating organized crime has been a significant mutual achievement. Colombia\u2019s experience in that fight and the lessons learned from Plan Colombia have given the country considerable security expertise. Today, Colombia is training public servants from numerous countries on security-related issues. Between 2010 and 2018, over 46,000 individuals from eighty-one countries received training by Colombian public officials on the fight against drugs, the prevention and control of crime, the strengthening of the military and police, and citizen security and organizational development. About 60 percent of those trained were in Central America under the Triangular Cooperation Plan between Colombia and Canada (2013), and the Cooperation Plan between Colombia and the United States to strengthen Central America and the Caribbean (USCAP).\nIn 2012, the United States and Colombia signed the Regional Security Joint Action Plan. Since then, personnel from the military forces, police, and similar institutions of beneficiary countries have been trained. For 2020, Argentina, Ecuador, and Paraguay are projected to become beneficiary countries of the program. The United States and Colombia should expand their shared security portfolio in international hot spots where Colombia can play a pivotal role. This would advance US interests globally, while also reducing costs to the United States and minimizing cultural and language barriers.\nIn the last twenty years, Colombia\u2019s National Police has also increased its cooperation with various countries in the region as well as with Interpol, the international criminal police agency that the country joined in 1954. Colombia has taken a leading role in the creation and management of the American Police Community, or Ameripol, since 2007, an organization that integrates thirty-three police forces of Latin America and the Caribbean. Between 2010 and 2012, Colombia supported more than sixty \u201coutsourcing\u201d activities in security, benefiting more than 220 institutions and fifty national and local partners. With support from the United States, Colombia trained more than 10,000 officers in forensic investigation and special operations between 2009 and 2013.\nIn that same period, Colombia trained almost 22,000 military and police personnel from various countries.26Diego Felipe Vera, \u201cCooperaci\u00f3n Internacional y Seguridad: el Caso Colombiano,\u201d in Memorias del Seminario Acad\u00e9mico \u201cProspectivas en seguridad y defensa en Colombia,\u201d ed. Vera (Libros Escuela Superior de Guerra, 2018), 41-47, https://esdeguelibros.edu.co/index.php/editorial/catalog/download/28/24/404-1?inline=1. To help advance police capabilities in the region, Colombia, in one year alone, trained police personnel from Guatemala, El Salvador, Panama, Jamaica, Peru, Ecuador, and Brazil. In total, through international cooperation agreements that focus on crimes of kidnapping and extortion, criminal investigation, criminal intelligence, and human rights, Colombia has made a substantial contribution to advancing security, providing assistance to sixteen countries in the region.\nColombia has the potential to become a security hub for the region. Colombia can play a fundamental role in helping to transform the regional security order, moving from reactivity and unilateralism to strategic planning, multilevel coordination, and the institutionalization of cooperation against transitional organized crime. For this to happen, the United States should continue supporting Colombia\u2019s military and police. Although Colombia plays a leading role on regional security issues, greater efforts must be made to ensure the continuity of its leadership as the country grapples with economic challenges and security concerns both internal and external in nature. In addition to the Venezuela crisis, the August 2019 announcement of a \u201cnew phase of the armed struggle\u201d by Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez, a former FARC commander, is a clear indication of the many security challenges facing Colombia. By working with the United States to improve security in Colombia and in the region, the US-Colombia partnership\u2014through efforts such as a joint evaluation of security capacities and security investment plans\u2014can set the foundation for long-lasting prosperity and stability.\nReturn to table of contents\ufeff\nOver the past decades, Colombia and the United States have consolidated a mutually beneficial partnership that has successfully safeguarded both nations\u2019 security interests. Under Plan Colombia, the country became an increasingly peaceful and prosperous democracy and, together, the United States and Colombia effectively reduced transnational organized crime, violence, coca cultivation, and drug trafficking. Now, with Colombia\u2019s improved security situation, strengthened economy, and increased leadership in the region, the bilateral relationship calls for a renewed partnership.\nInstability in neighboring states and interference of extra-hemispheric powers in the region further reinforce the need for a deepened and modernized US-Colombia partnership. After rigorous consultations and discussions, the Atlantic Council\u2019s US-Colombia Task Force identified three major areas that will serve as the foundation for the bilateral relationship going forward: economic development; rule of law, rural development, and the fight against drugs; and joint leadership in the region.\nThe interests of Colombia and the United States are more intertwined than ever before. The new US-Colombia partnership should recognize this reality, and capitalize on the opportunities that this represents. The partnership will be further solidified as the United States supports Colombia\u2019s efforts to stabilize territories, foster rural development, and bring about a sustainable democratic transition in Venezuela. Economic and diplomatic ties will also be strengthened as both countries work together for the eventual reconstruction of Venezuela and the promotion of stability in other parts of the region, particularly in Central America.\nReturn to table of contents\ufeff\nThe United States and Colombia stand to benefit from a partnership that promotes economic development in both countries. Bilateral trade and investment offer multiple opportunities for economic growth that will directly benefit both economies. A stronger Colombian economy not only translates to improved living conditions for Colombians but also protects key US national security interests by undermining the drug trade and other illicit economies as well as illegal armed actors. A stronger economic partnership between the two countries will help the United States achieve greater engagement with Latin America to manage current challenges and seize growing opportunities.\nThe Atlantic Council\u2019s US-Colombia Task Force identified the following three areas as paramount to the bilateral economic relationship: trade and investment; formalization and taxation; and innovation, science, technology, and education. The first area explores opportunities for increased economic growth in both countries. The second area focuses on how to strengthen Colombia\u2019s taxation system and further develop the country\u2019s formal economy. Finally, the third area examines innovative opportunities for mutually beneficial exchange that further both nation\u2019s economic and security interests.\nWith an improved security situation, abundant natural resources, and an educated, growing middle class, Colombia has the potential to become an even stronger economic partner for the United States.27\u201cOutcomes of Current U.S. Trade Agreements,\u201d US State Department, https://www.state.gov/trade-agreements/outcomes-of-current-u-s-trade-agreements/. In 2012, the US-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement (TPA) took effect. Upon entry into force, 80 percent of US exports of consumer and industrial goods and 50 percent of US exports of agricultural products to Colombia became duty free. The remaining tariffs are scheduled to phase out by 2027. Colombia should consider accelerating the elimination of certain non-agricultural tariffs, with a focus on industries that wouldn\u2019t be disrupted by the removal of such protections, to advance US-Colombia bilateral trade and export flows in line with Colombia\u2019s other bilateral agreements. While US exports to Colombia decreased 16 percent, from $16.4 billion in 2012 to $13.7 billion in 2018, due in part to the sharp depreciation of the Colombian peso, agricultural and manufacturing exports continue to enjoy significant growth.28Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estad\u00edstica, \u201cCenso Nacional de Poblaci\u00f3n y Vivienda,\u201d Government of Colombia, 2018, https://www.dane.gov.co/index.php/estadisticas-por-tema/demografia-y-poblacion/censo-nacional-de-poblacion-y-vivenda-2018; United States International Trade Commission, \u201cHarmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (2018), Basic Edition,\u201d 2018, https://hts.usitc.gov/view/list. According to the US International Trade Commission (ITC), the TPA will expand US exports by more than $1.1 billion and increase US GDP by $2.5 billion.\nFully implementing the TPA represents a significant opportunity for both countries. The results would not only increase trade, jobs, and economic growth, but also improve protections for intellectual property rights, labor rights, and the environment. Moreover, since Colombia\u2019s capacity to continue dealing with the Venezuelan crisis depends on the strength of its economy, the economic bilateral relationship will also benefit both countries\u2019 national security interests. However, for the US-Colombia TPA\u2019s potential to be fully realized, both countries must make changes. Colombia has yet to implement some aspects of the TPA to the fullest, including bills on internet service providers\u2019 responsibilities, commercial agency, and a screen TV quota, the ratification of the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (1991) treaty, and allowing for importation of duty free remanufactured goods.\nFully implementing the TPA represents a significant opportunity for both countries.\nEmployees organize bouquets of flowers to be exported overseas, ahead of Valentine\u2019s Day, at a farm in Facatativa, Cundinamarca, Colombia.

(Reuters/Jaime Saldarriaga)\nAdditionally, strengthened trade and investment between Colombia and the United States will help to provide some counterweight to China\u2019s growing influence in Latin America. Over the last twenty years, trade between China and Latin America has multiplied eighteen times, from $12 billion in 2000 to $224 billion in 2016.29Anabel Gonz\u00e1lez, \u201cLatin America \u2013 China Trade and Investment Amid Global Tensions,\u201d The Atlantic Council, December 2018, https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/images/publications/Latin-America-China-Trade-and-Investment-Amid-Global-Tensions.pdf. Today, China is the largest trading partner for Chile, Peru, and Brazil,30Gonz\u00e1lez, \u201cLatin America \u2013 China Trade and Investment Amid Global Tensions.\u201d and, in the case of Colombia, China has moved to become its second-largest export partner.31World Integrated Trade Solutions (WITS), \u201cColombia Trade at a Glance : Most Recent Values,\u201d The World Bank, 2019, https://wits.worldbank.org/countrysnapshot/en/COL. Whereas Chinese investment used to focus on oil and mining and agriculture, it is now expanding to other sectors of the economy including transport, finance, electricity generation and transmission, information and communications technology, and alternative energy.32\u201cChina moves into Latin America,\u201d The Economist, February 3rd, 2019, https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2018/02/03/china-moves-into-latin-america. Deepening commercial relations between Colombia and the United States will strengthen the commercial partnership in light of new Chinese economic interest, with the potential effect of having the bilateral relationship serve as a model for other countries seeing new Chinese economic interest.\nImplementing reforms geared to decreasing uncertainty for companies seeking to do business in Colombia is also needed, as frequent changes in the tax system and in regulations for different sectors create instability and unpredictability. Colombia and the United States could also work together to identify opportunities for US companies in Colombia. In particular, given the rising tensions between the US and China, several US companies are seeking to relocate from China. The Colombian government and US companies could look for opportunities for mutually beneficial agreements that facilitate their relocation to Colombia. Colombia also needs to give predictability and stability to intellectual property rights by not imposing discriminatory compulsory licenses.\nThe United States, for its part, should strive to accelerate the process of implementing pending TPA related matters. These include the regional accumulation provision with Peru and other Pacific Alliance countries for textiles and lifting environmental barriers to Colombian palm biodiesel. The US government should also work with the Colombian government to speed up and harmonize sanitary and phytosanitary requirements to facilitate and accelerate the entry of certain Colombian products\u2014mainly agricultural ones\u2014into the US market. Although 105 Colombian agricultural products have preferential access to the US market within the TPA, and seven are currently undergoing the market access process, fewer than ten match the phytosanitary protocols required to enter the United States. This year Colombia is expecting tangible progress for top market-access priorities: fresh peppers, mangoes, pitayas (also known as dragon fruit), papayas, watermelons, cantaloupes, blueberries, and passifloras (yellow passion fruit, sweet granadilla, purple passion fruit, and banana passion fruit).\nThus, the US government could make it a priority for the US Department of Agriculture\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) to expedite the approval of these products. Colombia, in turn, could prepare to effectively promote and market these products in the United States. Given the importance of reducing coca crops for both the United States and Colombia, devising mechanisms for expedient entry into the US market of agricultural products that are part of crop substitution schemes is also a priority. The United States could also facilitate the entry of Colombian products into the US market by allowing companies to fulfill required processes at competitive prices. For example, Colombian companies could be allowed to carry out product radiation processes in the United States as opposed to Colombia, to reduce costs and logistical barriers. The United States could also work with Colombia to establish a fast-track process for companies that already have the certificate of economic operator authorized by both Colombia\u2019s tax agency, the National Directorate of Customs and Taxation (DIAN), and the Business Alliance for Secure Commerce.\nDuring the last years, Colombia has made enormous progress on labor legislation, due, in part, to the sustained implementation of the Labor Action Plan. The government has increased the number of labor inspectors and issued new regulations to strengthen control over abusive subcontracting methods. Regarding the judiciary, Colombia has made significant progress in pursuing and solving cases related to instances of violence and threats against union members. The United States has recognized this progress. The United States and Colombia can further improve labor conditions by revising their agreement to include success metrics that focus on preventing labor violations rather than only sanctioning them. A modern approach would promote legal flexible labor tools to effectively increase productivity and reduce job informality and unemployment. Examples include temporary work, part-time work, telework, flexible salaries, and subcontracting, among others.33Christian Camilo Vargas Isaza et al., \u201cTercerizaci\u00f3n e intermediaci\u00f3n laboral: balance y retos,\u201d Asociaci\u00f3n Nacional de Empresarios de Colombia (ANDI), June 2019, http://www.andi.com.co/Uploads/Tercerizacio%CC%81n%20e%20intermediacio%CC%81n%20laboral%20balance%20y%20retos%20Colombia%20CESLA.pdf.\nThere is ample opportunity for increased US investment in Colombia, especially in areas of innovation, science, technology, and agroindustry.\nFor Colombia\u2019s economy to grow and offer new market possibilities for the United States, Colombian firms need to grow stronger and create jobs. As explored below, a better economic situation is also the most effective and sustainable way to reduce cocaine trafficking from Colombia to the United States. Granting Colombia\u2019s steel and aluminum products entering the US market an exemption from the 25 percent and 10 percent tariffs, respectively, which were imposed under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, would contribute to Colombia\u2019s economic growth. While Colombian exports of these products represent only 0.5 percent of the US market, these tariffs affect the installed capacity and job creation of Colombian companies. Moreover, the Colombian government has implemented several additional antidumping measures against steel and aluminum products coming from countries that contribute to world overcapacity, especially China.\nThe United States should also continue to support the Pacific Alliance. This alliance, which Colombia helped create, is now considering merging with another regional bloc in Latin America, Mercosur, and wants to bring in more partners and establish new trade deals with Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Singapore. If this happens, the global economy could experience a tremendous boom. Colombia should continue with its commitment and dedication to solving the different issues that could arise during this process, and the United States should support and even encourage this alliance.\nOpportunities for bilateral investment, which benefit both countries, are also growing. Colombia is committed to developing efficient capital markets, creating jobs, and building legal and regulatory systems that meet world-class standards for security and transparency. Its accession to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in May 2018 reflects the country\u2019s attainment of these standards and encourages further investment and economic cooperation. US foreign direct investment (FDI) in Colombia totaled $7.2 billion in 2017 and Colombian FDI in the United States totaled $2.6 billion, supporting 5,500 US jobs.34SelectUSA, \u201cForeign Direct Investment (FDI): Colombia,\u201d July 2019, https://www.selectusa.gov/servlet/servlet.FileDownload?file=015t0000000LKM6. There is ample potential for increased US investment in Colombia, especially in areas of innovation, science, technology, and agroindustry. As well, Colombia\u2019s acceptance of US federal motor vehicle standards opens additional areas for US investment.\nFor these opportunities to materialize, Colombia should strive to be more attractive to foreign investors, and can do so by offering more transparent conditions for FDI and reducing regulations, nontariff barriers, as well as cumbersome operations and foreign trade procedures. Strengthening the institutions tasked with ensuring compliance with labor, social security, and tax laws, and increasing coordination among these agencies, will improve enforcement.\nReforming an inefficient tax system should be, as explored below, a priority for future administrations. In addition, Colombia should spotlight itself as an investment destination, showing its potential to become a regional investment hub for the United States. Strengthening the rule of law and gaining institutional control of territories affected by violence, which are discussed later in this report, will also serve to minimize companies\u2019 concerns about political risk and uncertainty.\nThe United States can help foster conditions for long-term US investment in Colombia. Promoting the double taxation agreement between the two countries would provide investors with legal security and additional incentives for investment. In addition, US foreign policy toward Colombia should avoid producing any uncertainty around the bilateral relationship. The August 2019 certification of Colombia as cooperative in counternarcotics efforts was important to avoid such uncertainty. Any ambiguity in the strength of the relationship negatively impacts investment and commercial flows. Sending the message that the two countries support each other as strategic allies is good for business.\nUS-COLOMBIA PRIORITIES MOVING FORWARD\nTRADE AND INVESTMENT\nCOLOMBIA\n\u2022 Implement fully pending aspects of the TPA to increase trade, jobs, and economic growth, but also improve protections for intellectual property rights, labor rights, and the environment.\n\u2022 Launch structured promotional campaigns for Colombian products entering the US market.\nUNITED STATES\n\u2022 Implement pending aspects of the TPA, including the regional cumulation provision for textiles and increased access to biodiesel products.\n\u2022 Grant Colombia\u2019s steel and aluminum products entering the US market an exemption from tariffs of 25 percent and 10 percent, respectively.\nUS-COLOMBIA PARTNERSHIP\n\u2022 Harmonize sanitary and phytosanitary requirements to accelerate the entry of preapproved Colombian products into the US market. Top market access priorities include: fresh peppers, mangoes, and passifloras.\n\u2022 Promote the double taxation agreement between the two countries to increase legal security and incentives for bilateral investment.\nA healthy Colombian economy provides the United States with greater market opportunities for goods and services. It can also help to stabilize the territories where illicit groups operate and illicit economies thrive, especially the cocaine market. Two of the most critical barriers to economic development in Colombia are the country\u2019s tax system and high levels of informality. The United States can partner with Colombia to support much-needed reforms to counter these two challenges.\nTax revenues in Colombia have increased consistently from the 1990s to around 15 percent of the country\u2019s GDP today, but remain very low by international standards:35Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), \u201cDetails of Tax Revenue \u2013 Colombia,\u201d 2018, https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=LAC_REVCOL. the OECD average is 26 percent of GDP\u2014a measure similar to that of Argentina (29 percent) and Brazil (26 percent). Part of the problem is Colombia\u2019s tax structure. In Colombia, around 45 percent of these revenues come from taxes on goods and services, which tend to be regressive. Corporate taxes are considered relatively high, with rates of up to 34 percent36The Colombian Government has established a progressive path to reduce corporate taxes from 33 % to 30 % over the next four years. and revenues accounting for 3.8 percent of GDP, which discourages formalization and entrepreneurship. The Duque administration did pass tax reform in 2018, which is currently under revision by the Constitutional Court and aims to progressively lower corporate tax rates down to 30 percent by 2022. Still, in comparison, the average corporate tax in Latin American countries in 2018 was 28 percent.37Daniel Bunn, \u201cCorporate Tax Rates Around the World, 2018,\u201d Tax Foundation, November 2017, 2018, https://taxfoundation.org/corporate-tax-rates-around-world-2018/. Dividends to individuals are taxed at a small percentage, and while this avoids the double taxation of distributed profits, it reduces progressivity. Meanwhile, revenues from personal income taxes represent 1.1 percent of GDP and social security contributions are 2.1 percent of GDP.\nThe progressivity of the tax system is undermined by generous tax relief and exemptions\u2014there are more than 200 exemptions, representing approximately 30 percent of tax collection\u2014which mostly benefit the wealthier sectors of Colombian society.38Rafael De la Cruz, Leandro Gast\u00f3n Andri\u00e1n, and Mario Loterszpil, \u201cColombia: Toward a High-income Country with Social Mobility,\u201d Inter-American Development Bank, January 2016, https://publications.iadb.org/en/colombia-toward-high-income-country-social-mobility. Colombia\u2019s tax system still needs reforms to enhance progressivity and raise more revenue that can then be channeled to expand social policies. However, an eventual tax reform should maintain corporate taxes at levels comparable to those of other OECD countries. Colombia should also improve transparency and stability in the development and implementation of this updated taxation system.\nTax evasion should also be addressed to strengthen state capacity and foster economic development\u2014this will enhance Colombia\u2019s ability to be a strong economic and security ally to the United States. The DIAN has local branches in only forty-three of the country\u2019s 1,121 municipalities, and the tax officer-to-inhabitant ratio is half the regional average (one to 10,000). Evasion of income tax and value-added tax is estimated to be 4 percent of the GDP, and informality, discussed below, also facilitates tax evasion while reducing the tax base.39De la Cruz, Andri\u00e1n, and Loterszpil, \u201cColombia: Toward a High-income Country with Social Mobility.\u201d Overall, the tax system significantly distorts economic activity and has a very small redistributive impact.\nTwo of the most critical barriers to economic development in Colombia are the country\u2019s tax system and high levels of informality.\nColombia has a large informal economy, equivalent to one-third of its GDP.40Asociaci\u00f3n Nacional de Instituciones Financieras (ANIF), \u201cReducci\u00f3n del efectivo y tama\u00f1o de la econom\u00eda subterr\u00e1nea en Colombia,\u201d May 2017, http://www.anif.co/sites/default/files/investigaciones/anif-asobancaria-efectivo0517.pdf. As of 2015, about 60 percent of firms and 48 percent of workers remained in the informal sector. In the countryside, almost two-thirds of farmers lack formal property titles to their land,41DANE, \u201cTercer Censo Nacional Agropecuario: Tomo 2 \u2013 Resultados,\u201d November 2016, https://www.dane.gov.co/files/images/foros/foro-de-entrega-de-resultados-y-cierre-3-censo-nacional-agropecuario/CNATomo2-Resultados.pdf. and although informality decreased by seven percentage points since 2001,42Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), \u201cEstudios Econ\u00f3micos de la OCDE: Colombia,\u201d May 2017, http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/Colombia-2017-OECD-economic-survey-overview-spanish.pdf. it is still a critical barrier to development. Informality negatively affects economic growth as it promotes low-paying jobs, unemployment, and lower productivity by allocating resources ineffectively. Because of this, informal firms have lower access to credit, use more unskilled labor, adopt less technology, perform less training, and have low access to public goods.\nInformal firms limit the growth of formal firms as the former do not comply with standards and regulations, which artificially lowers their costs, generating unfair competition. More than half of formal firms in Colombia report that informal firms are one of their top challenges.43The World Bank, \u201cEnterprise surveys : Colombia country profile 2010,\u201d in Enterprise surveys country profile, (Washington, DC: World Bank Group, 2010), http://espanol.enterprisesurveys.org/data/exploreeconomies/2010/colombia#informality. In addition, informality reduces the tax base and access to credit and social insurance for lower income families. Informality also discourages investment and productivity and widens economic disparities across the country, while limiting poverty reduction and the consolidation of the middle class. As an important obstacle for Colombian development, informality compromises efforts to reduce coca cultivation and combat illegal armed groups, therefore undermining US law enforcement and national security interests. Additionally, informality makes it harder for US firms to seize the opportunities that Colombia\u2019s expanding market has to offer.\nThe United States and Colombia can engage in mutually beneficial cooperation that helps Colombia reduce informality. The two countries should continue training labor inspectors, as they did in a program from 2012 to 2016, with more focus on prevention of labor violations rather than sanctions. Colombia should continue its fight against abusive and illegal subcontracting as well as using legal subcontracting as a necessary tool to increase formality, employment, competitiveness, and productivity. The United States can work with Colombia to devise best practices for achieving several goals. These include streamlining the process for firm creation and closure; reducing unnecessary norms and barriers for firms across geographical divisions; making labor regulations more flexible; and increasing access to credit and other business services. To incentivize formalization, the Colombian government can also engage in public information campaigns to educate workers about the benefits of working in the formal economy (sick days, maternal leave, paid vacation days, etc.). The country also can improve access to credit and other business services to incentivize firms to register their activity and pay taxes.\nImproving the modernization process and strengthening the governability of Colombia\u2019s tax agency, DIAN, is of critical importance. Colombia needs to update the software that its taxation system relies on, as it is ineffective and facilitates corruption and money laundering. Strengthening the DIAN and customs agencies\u2014with US assistance\u2014is also a priority because both have been permeated by trafficking groups and other types of criminal organizations. Digitalizing the customs, tax, ports, and airports systems, as well as incorporating blockchain technology would allow for higher traceability of goods and improved intelligence, which favor legal activities and tax collection while creating obstacles for illicit economies. Digitalizing the economy would also benefit US companies doing business in Colombia. The United States could support this process by facilitating the training of engineers. US companies could also contribute by verifying the quality of new information systems.\nIt is also important to accelerate the process to conduct US immigration procedures on Colombian soil. United States immigration authorities have begun high-level talks with Colombia\u2019s Foreign Ministry to study this possibility. This means that travelers departing the special US designated immigration area in El Dorado Airport in Bogot\u00e1 would be subject to the laws of the US, and US officers would conduct the same immigration, customs, and agriculture inspections of international air travelers typically performed upon arrival in the United States. A close working relationship on the ground means that authorities from both nations will be able to share information on immigration, customs, and agriculture.\nUS-COLOMBIA PRIORITIES MOVING FORWARDFORMALIZATION AND TAXATION\nCOLOMBIA\n\u2022    Reform the current tax structure to increase tax revenues while also encouraging formalization and entrepreneurship. An eventual tax reform should maintain corporate taxes at levels comparable to those of other OECD countries.\n\u2022    Incentivize formalization by educating workers about the benefits of participating in the formal economy, while also offering improved access to credit and other business services.\nUS-COLOMBIA PARTNERSHIP\n\u2022    Cooperate to reduce informality and protect formal firms doing business in Colombia. The partnership should work to devise best practices for simplifying the process of firm creation and closure; reduce unnecessary norms and barriers for firms; make labor regulations more flexible to increase formalization, productivity, and competitiveness; and improve the modernization process of Colombia\u2019s tax agency, DIAN.\n\u2022    Accelerate the process to conduct US immigration customs and inspections at El Dorado airport in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. A close working relationship on the ground will allow authorities from both nations to share real-time information on immigration, customs, and agriculture.\n\u2022    Collaborate to increasingly digitalize Colombia\u2019s economy, as well as its customs, tax, ports and airport systems, to enhance the traceability of goods, improve tax collection, and undermine illicit economies.\nFor Colombia to achieve the long-term development needed to stop cocaine production and further advance legality, advancements in innovation, science, technology, and education are needed. In particular, for Colombia to keep the high growth rates that maintain advances in poverty reduction and development, it must diversify production and increase productivity and sustainability. Creating legal opportunities in areas affected by violence and illicit economies also requires transforming rural economies. Innovation, science, technology, and education are essential to these quests. The United States has ample experience in these areas and can share best practices with Colombia. At the same time, both countries can engage in new, productive collaborative initiatives, as explained below.\nAccording to the World Bank, in 2017, the total amount of government and private sector funds spent on research and development (R & D) in Colombia was only 0.24 percent of the country\u2019s GDP\u2014an extremely low value compared to the average investment in the sector for Latin America and the Caribbean (0.8 percent). Investment in science, technology, and innovation in Colombia is slightly higher (0.65 percent of GDP). In the 2018 Global Innovation Index (GII), which measures the performance of innovation ecosystems in 126 countries, Colombia ranked sixty-third, below Chile, Costa Rica, Mexico, and Uruguay. In 2017, about 30 percent of science, technology, and innovation funding came from the public sector and 70 percent from the private sector. For R & D, the percentages were 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively.44Alexander Cotte Poveda et al., \u201cIndicadores de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda Colombia 2018,\u201d Observatorio Colombiano de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda, April 2018, https://www.ocyt.org.co/proyectos-y-productos/informe-anual-de-indicadores-de-ciencia-y-tecnologia-2018/.\nThe United States should work with Colombia to create a development strategy to fund research centers in Colombia. It should be a results-oriented and impact-driven strategy, as are the funding strategies of the United States\u2019 National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health. The United States could also share its expertise in strengthening industry-university collaboration, given its ample experience in connecting university training with private-sector needs and in promoting innovation by research centers that responds to the needs of firms. Promoting innovation, science, and technology in Colombia will help disrupt the conditions that facilitate illicit activities while also maximizing human capital in this important US free-trade partner.\nThe United States could also support Colombian efforts to provide technical assistance to firms in order to increase their productivity and prepare them for more sophisticated innovation processes. The United States has significant experience in the design, implementation, and evaluation of such schemes. The US Manufacturing Extension Partnership, for example, has been successful in improving production processes, upgrading technology capabilities, increasing competitiveness of firms, and facilitating innovation throughout the United States.45Ronald S. Jarmin in his 1999 study finds that firms that participated in manufacturing extension partnership (MEP) programs in the United States experienced between 3.4 and 16 percent higher labor productivity growth between 1987 and 1992 than nonparticipating firms. Ronald S. Jarmin, \u201cEvaluating the Impact of Manufacturing Extension on Productivity Growth,\u201d Journal of Policy Analysis and Management 18, no.1 (1999), 99\u2013119.\nEducation is another area rich with potential for US-Colombia collaboration. Colombia faces multiple challenges to achieving a high-quality and equitable education system. Given that the transition from illicit to licit economies requires new human-capital development, education in Colombia should be an area of importance to the United States. The United States can make several contributions. For example, Colombia lags behind most Latin American countries in English proficiency. In 2018, it was ranked 60 among 88 countries in the world in this category.46\u201cEl ranking mundial m\u00e1s grande seg\u00fan su dominio del ingl\u00e9s,\u201d EF, 2018, https://www.ef.com/wwes/epi/. The Colombian government has tried to increase the number of English teachers, but at least 3,200 more are needed. The United States could help to train Colombian English teachers and provide additional scholarships for US teachers who seek to teach English in Colombia.47Semana, \u201cColombia y su preocupante nivel de ingl\u00e9s,\u201d April 10, 2017, https://www.semana.com/educacion/articulo/bilinguismo-nivel-de-ingles-en-colombia/542736. At the same time, Colombia could offer education opportunities for US teachers, especially Spanish-language programs, while they teach English in public schools in Colombia. This and other types of exchange programs for language training would benefit both countries.\nAdvancing the interests of both Colombia and the United States in vulnerable territories requires prioritizing rural education. The Colombian government is creating partnerships with land grant universities to develop programs focused on agriculture. Purdue University, for example, has partnered with Colombia to promote collaborative research, education, and economic development activities. One of the projects consists of a master plan for sustainable development of the Orinoqu\u00eda region based on analysis-and research-based tools to enable a deeper understanding of the economic and development opportunities related to agriculture and tourism.48\u201cColombia Purdue Partnership,\u201d Purdue University, https://www.purdue.edu/colombia/. Fostering such partnerships will catalyze initiatives for mutually beneficial collaboration, while contributing to development, stabilization, and legality, all of which undermine the coca industry and the rise of criminal actors.\nColombia and the United States can also broaden opportunities for educational exchange via scholarships, grants, exchange programs, and joint research, aiming to create long-lasting connections between people and institutions in both countries, which, in turn, can promote innovation. About 8,000 Colombians study in the United States every year, with an economic impact of $302 million.49US Department of State, \u201c2018 Fact Sheet: Colombia,\u201d in Open Doors. Report on International Educational Exchange, 2018, https://p.widencdn.net/19i6p4/Open-Doors-2018-Colombia. Approximately 236 of these students receive full scholarships through the Fulbright Program, while others get partial funding through collaborative programs between Fulbright and Colombian agencies. Expanding opportunities for postgraduate training of Colombian students in the United States would make a direct contribution to the development of human capital and economic development in Colombia, which would benefit shared US-Colombia interests.\nSimilarly, Colombia can become a preferred destination for US students looking to study in Latin America. Today, only around 900 Americans study in Colombia every year\u2014about one-fourth of the number of study-abroad students going to Peru and Ecuador.50US Department of State, \u201c2018 Fact Sheet: Latin America & Caribbean,\u201d in Open Doors. Report on International Educational Exchange, 2018, https://p.widencdn.net/46tto7/Open-Doors-2018-Latin-America-and-Caribbean. Central American countries like Guatemala and Nicaragua receive more than 2,000 American students every year, despite not having any university ranked among the top fifty in Latin America. Colombia, to the contrary, has three universities ranked among the top thirty and one among the top ten.51\u201cBest Universities in Latin America 2019,\u201d Times Higher Education, June 18, 2019, https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/best-universities/best-universities-latin-america. Colombia can become an important education destination for US students, especially for learning Spanish and studying biodiversity. One government agency, such as the new Ministry of Science, Innovation and Technology, should coordinate different efforts and initiatives to facilitate alliances between US and Colombian universities to promote Colombia as one of the top study-abroad destinations for US students seeking to study in Latin America.\nFinally, creating programs specifically for ethnic minorities is also a priority for both countries. The Colombian Ministry of Education is currently advancing an agreement with historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) to provide funding for Afro-Colombian students to study in the United States while offering scholarships for foreign students to study in Colombia. The United States can share its experience in developing programs to support the enrollment of women, ethnic minorities, and low-income students in STEM areas (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). Exchanging such best practices with Colombia can have a positive impact on education and innovation in Colombia while furthering cultural exchanges.\nUS-COLOMBIA PRIORITIES MOVING FORWARD INNOVATION, SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND EDUCATION\nCOLOMBIA \u2022    Designate one agency responsible for coordinating alliances between universities in Colombia and the United States. Both large and small universities should benefit from this program to ensure that students form all ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds have access to new opportunities. Specifically, the agency should promote collaborative research and education between Colombian and US universities.\n\u2022    Broaden and increase awareness about opportunities for educational exchanges via scholarships, grants, and study abroad programs, especially for ethnic minorities.\n\u2022    Promote Colombia as a prime education destination for US students in areas such as Spanish and biodiversity.\nUNITED STATES\n\u2022    The United States can offer trainings to Colombian English teachers and provide additional scholarships to US English teachers seeking to teach in Latin America. While in Colombia, US English teachers will have access to additional education opportunities, especially Spanish language programs.\nUS-COLOMBIA PARTNERSHIP\n\u2022    Collaborate to strengthen industry-university collaboration in Colombia to foster innovation. The United States can also help Colombian research institutions replicate the funding models and development strategies of US research centers. By promoting innovation, science, and technology in Colombia, the partnership will help transform the conditions that incentivize illegality, safeguarding both countries\u2019 national security interests.\nReturn to table of contents\ufeff\nCrucial to the advancement of shared US and Colombia interests is the stabilization and development of territories where coca is cultivated, illegal armed groups thrive, and populations face violence, low-quality governance, and poverty. The state needs to gain institutional control of these territories and foster development to accelerate transformation. Employing an integral drug policy that not only decreases coca crops in the short run but also focuses on the other stages of the drug market\u2014including cocaine production, trafficking, and consumption\u2014is essential for tackling the world drug problem in a way that achieves long-term goals.\nThese strategies also require protecting human-rights defenders and social leaders. Defending the lives of its citizens is Colombia\u2019s principal duty, and protecting civic leaders is needed for democracy to flourish. Transforming the institutional capacity of the state in vulnerable territories, tackling the world drug problem in an integral way, and protecting social leaders will change the structural conditions that breed illegality, undermine the well-being of the Colombian population, and threaten US national security interests.\nTwo critical barriers to Colombia\u2019s security and development\u2014weak institutions and lack of economic opportunities in rural areas\u2014affect both Colombia and the United States. These conditions serve as the breeding ground for coca cultivation and cocaine production, illegal mining, and environmental degradation as well as the strengthening of criminal organizations, all of which affect the well-being of Colombian citizens as well as US national security interests.\nCritical to regaining control of rural areas is implementation of the Peace Agreement with the FARC. Following the UN Security Council\u2019s July 2019 visit to Colombia, the task force welcomes the decision of the Colombian government to request that the UN\u2019s verification and monitoring mandate and term be extended for an additional year beyond September 25, 2019, and the Security Council\u2019s agreement to give such request prompt consideration.\nFor the Colombian government, devoting the necessary effort and resources to implement the agreement is critical. Also critical is bringing to justice those who are in stated violation of the agreement and intend to return to conflict. All actors in Colombia are encouraged to work together to ensure peace agreement implementation. To accomplish this, Colombia will need resources beyond its own. We call on the US Congress and the US administration to provide significant resources for implementation over the coming years.\nAt the same time, Colombia will need long-term support beyond that of the United States, especially considering the fiscal strains of the Venezuela crisis (discussed in the following section). Continued financial assistance from the international community for implementation of the Colombian peace process is crucial for its success. Thus, we propose that the World Bank and/or Inter-American Development Bank convene an international consortium of donors to build on or strengthen existing efforts, develop a long-term funding plan, and then dedicate the necessary financial support.\nIn addition to the need for peace agreement implementation, weak or absent institutions must be addressed as each represent major threats to security and stability in Colombia. In places where the state is absent or weak, illegal armed groups and illicit economies thrive. As the FARC laid down their arms, preexisting and new armed groups moved in to fill the vacuum the rebels had left. These groups profit off the cocaine business and other illicit economies such as illegal mining and the smuggling of goods.\nMany of the communities that believed the end of the FARC meant the arrival of the state are experiencing fierce battles between different criminal groups competing over illicit rents.52Helen Murphy, and Luis Jaime Acosta, \u201cSpecial Report: A fractured peace \u2013 violent rivals rush into FARC void in Colombia,\u201d Reuters, April 26, 2018, https://www.reuters.com/article/us-colombia-peace-special-report/special-report-a-fractured-peace-violent-rivals-rush-into-farc-void-in-colombia-idUSKBN1HX2BD. According to official data, more than twenty-five illegal armed groups, with a total of about 7,000 members, operate in the country today.53Javier Jules, \u201cTras la ca\u00edda de \u2018Guacho\u2019, autoridades analizan estrategias para enfrentar grupos armados,\u201d La FM \u2013 RCN Radio, December 24, 2018, https://www.lafm.com.co/colombia/tras-la-caida-de-guacho-autoridades-analizan-las-estrategias-para-enfrentar-grupos-armados. The August 2019 call to arms by former FARC commander Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez reinforces the critical importance of meaningful reintegration of ex-combatants and attention to unmet needs in rural areas, the parts of the accord most behind in terms of implementation.\nAlthough Colombia has experienced in the last few years some of the lowest homicide rates in its recent history, violence is on the rise in some areas of the country, especially those affected by illicit economies and where the state has traditionally been weak. Today, Colombia continues to have the world\u2019s highest number of internally displaced persons,54Caracol Radio, \u201cColombia sigue siendo el pa\u00eds con m\u00e1s n\u00famero de desplazados internos con 7,4 millones: Acnur,\u201d June 19, 2016, https://caracol.com.co/radio/2017/06/19/nacional/1497887381_656795.html. and recently the number of victims of land mines and other explosives has soared.55Santiago Torrado, \u201cLa violencia aumenta en varias regiones de Colombia, alerta Cruz Roja,\u201d El Pa\u00eds, March 29, 2019, https://elpais.com/internacional/2019/03/28/colombia/1553795131_179462.html. Attacks against social leaders and human rights defenders have been on the rise since 2016, as explained below, and more than 100 former FARC members have been assassinated since the signing of the peace accords.56El Tiempo, \u201cVan 114 desmovilizados de las Farc asesinados,\u201d May 15, 2019, https://www.eltiempo.com/justicia/investigacion/desmovilizados-de-las-farc-asesinados-tras-el-proceso-de-paz-361882.\nColombia will need long-term support beyond that of the United States.\nIllicit economies thrive not only because institutions are weak but also because of the lack of economic opportunities. Coca grows in municipalities with very high levels of poverty and job informality57UNODC, \u201c\u00bfQui\u00e9nes son las familias que viven en las zonas con cultivos de coca?: Caracterizaci\u00f3n de las familias beneficiarias del Programa Nacional Integral de Sustituci\u00f3n de Cultivos Il\u00edcitos (PNIS),\u201d August 2018, https://www.unodc.org/documents/colombia/2018/Agosto/Quienes_son_las_familias_que_viven_en_las_zonas_con_cultivos_de_coca_N.1.pdf. and low tax revenue, connectivity, and institutional development.58Hernando Zuleta, \u201cCoca, coca\u00edna y narcotr\u00e1fico,\u201d Universidad de los Andes, Facultad de Econom\u00eda, Documentos CEDE no.42, June 2017, https://economia.uniandes.edu.co/components/com_booklibrary/ebooks/dcede2017-42.pdf. Public goods provision is also significantly lower than the national average: about one-third of the population is illiterate and 18 percent of minors are not enrolled in school.59UNODC, \u201c\u00bfQui\u00e9nes son las familias que viven en las zonas con cultivos de coca?\u201d Coca growers do not have higher earnings than most Colombian peasants; however, coca allows peasants to make money in areas with high transportation costs, a lack of facilities and chains to collect, store, and bring products to market, and poor access to credit, among other factors. Peasants receive, per hectare of coca grown, about $130\u2014which is 56 percent of the monthly minimum wage. In areas with coca crops, each coca-growing family cultivates between 0.5 and 1.8 hectares (ha) of coca and uses any additional hectares to cultivate legal crops.60UNODC, \u201c\u00bfQui\u00e9nes son las familias que viven en las zonas con cultivos de coca?\u201d Almost 27 percent of households in rural Colombia face monetary poverty. The percentage rises to 57 percent in areas where coca crops are present. In addition, approximately 90 percent of children ages six to nine living in areas with coca crops work in the fields.61UNODC, \u201c\u00bfQui\u00e9nes son las familias que viven en las zonas con cultivos de coca?\u201d\nTo help Colombia to dismantle illegal armed groups, fight coca cultivation and drug trafficking, and protect vulnerable populations, especially ethnic minorities, the United States should support its efforts to consolidate effective and legitimate state institutions in previously disenfranchised territories and promote rural development. This strategy requires a holistic long-term approach that goes beyond Colombian military and police deployment in areas affected by crime and violence.\nRather than investing in small-scale projects in many areas of the country, the United States should support an ambitious, multidimensional plan that includes security, justice, formalization of land property rights, education, health and other public goods provision, and economic opportunities to help vulnerable territories embark on a sustainable path to development. Although coca crops are located in twenty-two of the thirty-two Colombian departments, 60 percent of all coca crops are concentrated in three of these departments: Nari\u00f1o, Putumayo, and Norte de Santander. Furthermore, 44 percent of these crops grow in ten municipalities (Tib\u00fa, Sardinata, and El Tarra in Norte de Santander; Tumaco, El Charco, and Barba.coas in Nari\u00f1o; Puerto As\u00eds and Orito in Putumayo; El Tambo in Cauca; and Taraz\u00e1 in Antioquia).62UNODC, \u201cColombia \u2013 Monitoreo de territorios afectados por cultivos il\u00edcitos 2018,\u201d August 2019, https://www.unodc.org/documents/colombia/2019/Agosto/Informe_de_Monitoreo_de_Territorios_Afectador_por_Cultivos_Ilicitos_en_Colombia_2018_.pdf. This means that a successful, holistic intervention in ten municipalities could change the conditions of territories responsible for almost half the entire national coca production. This strategy will require careful planning and substantial resources for implementation. However, only a long-term, targeted approach will yield lasting results.\nWith support from different multilateral agencies, Colombia has created several funds, three of which were established with the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, and the United Nations to transform vulnerable territories, help them transition into licit economies, and consolidate peace.63\u201cFondos de Cooperaci\u00f3n,\u201d Agencia Presidencial de Cooperaci\u00f3n Internacional de Colombia, https://www.apccolombia.gov.co/seccion/fondos-de-cooperacion. Additional resources should be provided to these funds to support interventions seeking to transform prioritized territories. Going forward, this funding model could be replicated to aid other countries in the region that are spiraling into violence, criminality, illicit economies, and poor governance.\nAs a first step, both countries should take stock of previous interventions in rural areas. Different initiatives have been implemented by Colombian agencies and international organizations in attempts to bring the state to vulnerable communities, promote rural development, and advance democracy. Some of these interventions have focused explicitly on reducing coca cultivation and undermining criminal organizations. The US Agency for International Development (USAID) has led multiple projects pursuing these goals and has evaluated their impact individually. However, individual assessments have not provided conclusive evidence as to what initiatives (or combination of initiatives) can be most successful in strengthening institutions and rule of law, promoting rural development, and eradicating coca crops. The US-Colombia partnership should conduct a rigorous assessment of all previous interventions to determine how to best allocate development resources in the future.\nHow can the Colombian state consolidate its institutions in vulnerable territories? President Duque\u2019s plan to consolidate institutions and development in areas most affected by violence, crime, and poverty, called Zonas Futuro64Consejer\u00eda Presidencial para las Comunicaciones, \u201cZonas futuro: Zonas Estrat\u00e9gicas de intervenci\u00f3n Integral,\u201d accessed on September 5, 2019, https://id.presidencia.gov.co/Documents/190808-Infografia-Zonas-Futuro.pdf. (Future Zones), entails the coordinated action of different state agencies to offer basic services, transition from illicit to licit economies, and protect the environment. This strategy will be implemented in 2.4 percent of the national territory\u2014this is where about one-third of coca crops are located and where a large portion of the killing of social leaders has occurred. At the same time, the government has launched a stabilization program (announced in the Paz con Legalidad65Presidencia de la Rep\u00fablica de Colombia, \u201cPaz con legalidad,\u201d accessed on September 5, 2019, http://www.posconflicto.gov.co/Documents/politica-estabilizacion-Paz-con-legalidad.pdf. or Peace with Legality plan), a defense and security plan,66Gobierno de Colombia, \u201cPol\u00edtica de defensa y seguridad PDS,\u201d January 2019, https://www.mindefensa.gov.co/irj/go/km/docs/Mindefensa/Documentos/descargas/Prensa/Documentos/politica_defensa_deguridad2019.pdf. and a drug policy plan (Ruta Futuro67Minjusticia, \u201cRuta futuro: Pol\u00edtica Integral para Enfrentar el problema de las drogas,\u201d December 2018, http://www.minjusticia.gov.co/Portals/0/Documentos/RUTA_FUTURO_POLITICA_INTEGRAL.pdf. or Future Path). These plans deem it critical to create an integral policy that brings together authorities at national, departmental, and municipal levels under a shared vision. These policy plans focus on long-term goals, and they all recognize the importance of considering local contexts and promoting active community participation.\nColombia should continue to pursue this type of integral, holistic approach that builds on the participation of local communities and requires the coordination of different state agencies and levels of government. Success requires that these initiatives are coordinated by the Office of the President and have the presidency\u2019s full support. Ensuring constant accountability is also essential for implanting these interventions.\nThe United States should work with the Colombian government in its quest to address the structural conditions that reproduce violence and breed illegality in critical territories. Specifically, USAID could provide funding and technical assistance to large-scale, holistic interventions including the formalization of land property rights, public goods, viable projects for rural development, and institutional development\u2014especially around local justice, citizen security, and participatory democracy. In addition, the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), once operational in October 2019, should identify Colombia as a priority for development financing and encourage private sector-led development. Coordinating with other donors is crucial for interventions to be efficient. These efforts will pay off in the long run by undermining illicit economies and boosting Colombia\u2019s role as a strong security ally in Latin America.\nSustainable rural development must be market-driven. It requires the participation of both the state and the private sector. Cases like Colanta, a Colombian cooperative of cattle farmers that grew to become a leading company in the dairy sector, show the viability and sustainability of this type of initiative. With more than 10,000 members throughout the country, Colanta has generated more than 50,000 rural jobs. Another example of success is Corporaci\u00f3n Colombia Internacional (CCI), a state and private owned company that helps farmers structure their productive projects by presenting them with viable and environmentally sustainable licit crops they can cultivate in their respective region, helping them develop cost structures, facilitating their association with other farmers, and identifying potential international and national buyers for their products. CCI also provides technical assistance to farmers for three years and serves as a guarantor to buyers participating in the project. Between 2005 and 2018, more than 573,000 rural families have benefited from this model, of which 7,520 are indigenous peoples and 6,500 are Afro-Colombians.68\u201cHistorias de Vida,\u201d Corporaci\u00f3n Colombia Internacional, http://www.cci.org.co/historias-de-vida/\nThe US-Colombia partnership could support these projects at the outset by promoting investment delegations from the United States to support joint ventures for projects on alternative products. The partnership could also help with the commercialization of products. Legal products that have substituted coca crops could be promoted and marketed as a special type of fair trade good, and the United States could assist Colombia in adopting the best practices in agriculture, organic produce, and manufacturing, and prioritizing its access to the US market. Improving living conditions in rural Colombia advances US law enforcement and national security interests.\nExamples of successful private partnerships to foster rural development also suggest that US and Colombian companies can work together and support vulnerable communities. Nestl\u00e9 Nespresso SA, the Colombian Coffee Growers Federation (FNC), the foundation of the National Association of Entrepreneurs of Colombia (ANDI Foundation), and the Howard G. Buffett Foundation, for example, are working under an agreement whereby Nespresso acquires coffee from 100 producers in the Nari\u00f1o department who have substituted their coca crops for coffee plantations, while the Buffett Foundation helps to improve public goods provision in their communities.69Consejer\u00eda Presidencial para la Estabilizaci\u00f3n y la Consolidaci\u00f3n, \u201cFundaci\u00f3n Buffet, Nespresso y Fedecaf\u00e9 en alianza para apoyar la sustituci\u00f3n de cultivos del Gobierno,\u201d Gobierno de Colombia, May 29, 2019, http://www.posconflicto.gov.co/sala-prensa/noticias/2019/Paginas/cafe.aspx.\nOther public-private partnerships entail securing funds for projects to advance core business interests as well as development objectives. In the last two years, USAID has promoted such projects in Colombia through its Global Development Alliance, with most of the funding coming from the private sector. In these projects, companies are involved\u2014and have a stake\u2014in development projects. Both the United States and Colombia should support these initiatives and facilitate the involvement of the private sector.\nThe Colombian government could create a database or program to match farmers interested in substituting coca crops with parties interested in buying products. This initiative could have a large impact as the lack of a systematic way to connect new suppliers of licit products with buyers presents a major challenge for crop-substitution programs. The US and Colombian governments could also support these initiatives by increasing the access of licit substitute products to US and international markets. The United States also could cooperate with the Colombian private sector to facilitate processes of technology transfer, especially in the agricultural sector. In particular, Colombia could explore possible technology transfer and training agreements with state governments in the United States in agricultural areas including Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, Colorado, Nebraska, and Indiana. One possibility would be to create a \u201cfellows\u201d program to train Colombians on agricultural techniques for between six and twelve months in the United States under the condition that they return to Colombia to advise regional and local governments as well as farmers\u2019 organizations.\nYet both countries should recognize that not all rural development can be based on agriculture. About 20 percent of coca crops are located in national natural parks and forest preserves, where coca crops either cannot be substituted for licit crops or can only be substituted in minimal quantities.70UNODC, \u201cColombia \u2013 Monitoreo de territorios afectados por cultivos il\u00edcitos 2018.\u201d Identifying opportunities around biodiversity and environmental protection is crucial to designing policies that are appropriate for these areas. It is also important to consider allowing people to live in natural parks, rather than forbidding it, and creating opportunities for residents to work with the state in comanaging the parks and engaging in sustainability projects.\nConsidering the needs, preferences, and strengths of organized indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities in lands they own collectively also is of paramount importance since more than 25 percent of coca crops are located in their territories. Promoting development in these communities entails not only thinking about the specific product that can work but also about how the community can cooperate to maintain the required infrastructure, sell their products, and make substitution projects sustainable. It is important to support the organizational capacity of these communities and take into account the particular strengths\u2014and challenges\u2014of cohesive communities with collective property rights. For example, these communities have been found to be more effective at preventing deforestation,71Maria Alejandra Velez et al., \u201cIs Collective Titling Enough to Protect Forests? Evidence from Afro-Descendant Communities in the Colombian Pacific Region,\u201d Universidad de los Andes, Facultad de Econom\u00eda, Documentos CEDE no.2019-03, February 14, 2019, https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3334497. resisting against illegal armed actors,72Ana Arijona, \u201cInstitutions, Civilian Resistance, and Wartime Social Order: A Process\u2010driven Natural Experiment in the Colombian Civil War,\u201d Latin America Politics and Society 58-3 (2016), https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1548-2456.2016.00320.x. and opposing coca crops in their territories.73Mar\u00eda Alejandra V\u00e9lez, and Iv\u00e1n Lobo, \u201cChallenges of Organised Community Resistance in the Context of Illicit Economies and Drug War Policies: Insights from Colombia,\u201d Journal of Illicit Economies and Development 1-1 (2019), 72-79, https://jied.lse.ac.uk/articles/10.31389/jied.15/. Considering these communities as partners for environmental protection and development will open new possibilities insofar as the government ensures their safety.\nImproving living conditions in rural Colombia advances US law enforcement and national security interests.\nIn both natural parks and collectively owned lands, payments for ecosystem services (PES) can be a viable opportunity\u2014although perhaps not a sustainable one in the long run. PES can work as a transitional mechanism that allows residents of these areas to invest in green projects.74Maria Alejandra Velez et al., \u201cRecomendaciones para el dise\u00f1o e implementaci\u00f3n de incentivos para la conservaci\u00f3n en paisajes agricolas,\u201d Foro Nacional Ambiental, August 2017, http://www.foronacionalambiental.org.co/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/CONSERVACION-EN-PAISAJES-AGRICOLAS-web.pdf. For example, a community could use PES to develop highly differentiated products of high quality with the expectation that in the future the market pays for their added value. Colombia already has success stories: The Afro-Colombian community of El Roble in Tumaco is, for example, producing premium cacao that has received awards in Paris and Tokyo. Other possibilities include ecotourism and artisanal handicrafts. Colombia and the United States should partner to open new markets and create incentives for scaling green projects.\nColombia and the United States also can jointly address specific critical barriers to rural development with ambitious projects that can impact several communities. The formalization of property rights, for example, is a priority. Colombia, the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the United States, and three European countries are coming together to offer a large-scale solution: The Multipurpose Cadaster Project. This program will develop a land administration system to strengthen the security of property rights, facilitate access to land and property information, and support land tenure formalization for about 67,000 people, of which about 40 percent are women. The project has a differential approach for Afro-Colombian and indigenous communities.75The World Bank, \u201cColombia\u2019s Multipurpose Registry Will Become a Reality with World Bank Support,\u201d March 14, 2019, https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2019/03/14/colombias-multipurpose-registry-will-become-a-reality-with-world-bank-support. Partnerships like this support Colombia\u2019s efforts to develop state institutions and promote rural development in vulnerable areas, undermining illicit armed actors and creating barriers to coca cultivation and cocaine trafficking.\nIn reducing coca cultivation, a critical short-term goal is adjusting the National Integral Program for the Substitution of Illicit Crops (PNIS). Under this program, the government committed to provide monthly payments and technical assistance to families who agreed to eradicate their illicit crops and embark on licit economic activities. Of the 99,000 families that signed the agreement, 94 percent have eradicated their coca crops, honoring their commitments. Furthermore, according to UN data, coca replanting has only occurred in 0.6 percent of cases where growers joined the voluntary crop substitution program. This is quite a successful outcome compared to the 36 percent replanting rate of crops uprooted through forced eradication.76Alicia Liliana M\u00e9ndez, \u201cCuando comunidades erradican cultivos de coca, es menor la resiembra,\u201d El Tiempo, February 27, 2019, https://www.eltiempo.com/justicia/conflicto-y-narcotrafico/resiembra-es-de-0-6-en-7-puntos-donde-se-erradico-voluntariamente-331762.\nHowever, only 67 percent of the families have received subsidies and only 40 percent have received technical assistance. In most cases, subsidies and assistance started quite late in the process, compromising their ability to pursue a licit, productive project. It is now clear that the program is underfunded, has several design and implementation problems, and will not be viable if it is not adjusted.77Juan Carlos Garz\u00f3n, Juan David G\u00e9lvez, and Jos\u00e9 Luis Bernal, \u201c\u00bfEn qu\u00e9 va la sustituci\u00f3n de cultivos il\u00edcitos? Desaf\u00edos, dilemas actuales y la urgencia de un consenso,\u201d Fundaci\u00f3n Ideas para la Paz, April 2019, http://ideaspaz.org/media/website/FIP_sustitucion_VOL06.pdf. The minimal essential elements of the crop-substitution program are delivery of subsidies in the initial phase and timely technical assistance, ensuring that peasants can sell their licit products in the first few years\u2014either by matching them with sellers or having the government buy the produce.\nColombia and the United States should partner to open new markets and create incentives for scaling green projects.\nColombians uproot coca crops in rural areas. Rural development in Colombia is key to the reduction of coca crops and eradication of the illict drug trade. (REUTERS/John Vizcaino)\nHowever, making the PNIS a component of a broader approach that includes institutional and rural development, as discussed above, is critical. It is also crucial to take into account that broken government promises do not only undermine current efforts to reduce coca cultivation but also create a negative precedent and sow distrust between the communities and the state, compromising the possibility of future programs. The United States should support Colombia in its efforts to help families who uprooted their coca plants and are undertaking the transition to legality within a broader, integral policy of rural development.\nAnother critical barrier to rural development and rule of law consolidation in areas beyond the government\u2019s reach is the capacity of local bureaucrats. Local authorities in these territories usually lack the tools to transform the conditions that breed informality and illegality and part of the problem is the training of local bureaucrats. There is a wide gap in the skills of local public servants in municipalities affected by violence as compared to the rest of the country, given that trained public officials have little to no incentive to serve in rural areas. Expected salaries and security guarantees for public officials in these territories are significantly lower than those received in larger cities. Deprived of skilled leaders, vulnerable municipalities can hardly improve the quality of their governments\u2014and weak local governments often lead to corruption and increases in illicit drug trade and organized criminal groups, which undermines US national security interests.\nAnother critical barrier to rural development and rule of law consolidation in areas beyond the government\u2019s reach is the capacity of local bureaucrats.

Deprived of skilled leaders, vulnerable municipalities can hardly improve the quality of their governments\u2014and weak local governments often lead to corruption and increases in illicit drug trade and organized criminal groups, which undermines US national security interests.\nThe United States could promote programs to train highly talented local and nonlocal officials to serve in these municipal governments and offer them support while they are in office so that the characteristics of each locality are taken into account. These public servants could in turn train others and support them in their first years serving in vulnerable localities. Creating incentives for trained public servants to stay for long periods of time in vulnerable municipalities is crucial to sustainability.78Building on successful examples in Colombia and abroad, Fundaci\u00f3n Ideas para la Paz has proposed a program that entails selecting candidates with exceptional skills and training them to address the specific needs of identified municipalities where they will work for two to three years as coaches of public servants as well as participants in regular work processes and new initiatives. The program covers the expenses and honoraria of these professionals and offers them support throughout their tenure.\nBy investing in human capital, this program can have long-lasting effects not only on the quality of local governance but also in bringing about broader societal change through leadership. The Postsecondary School of Public Administration (Escuela Superior de Administraci\u00f3n P\u00fablica) is currently considering developing a program that would involve supporting public servants in critical territories in 2020. The United States can advance the transformation of local governments by supporting targeted programs like this one and investing in initiatives to educate and support a new generation of local leaders. Similar programs could be designed to train not only public officials but also doctors, educators, and professionals, and encouraging them to serve in rural areas and train local populations.\nWhere should these efforts be directed? Since transforming all needy areas in the country at the same time is not viable, it is imperative to focus on the most vulnerable territories. The 170 municipalities included in the Programas de Desarrollo con Enfoque Territorial (PDETs), or Development Programs with a Territorial Approach, have been most affected by violence in the past decades. With the demobilization of FARC, many areas previously under the group\u2019s control were left with a vacuum of power and this in turn has been progressively filled by criminal organizations.\nIn some of these territories, social leaders have been assassinated and coca cultivation and illegal mining have increased. In fact, the ten municipalities with  50 percent of the coca crops in Colombia are on this list of 170 municipalities. Of these, the PDETs of the Catatumbo region, Nari\u00f1o\u2019s Pacific wetlands, Arauca, and Bajo Cauca Antioque\u00f1o\u2014areas also included in the strategic Future Zones of President Duque\u2019s plan\u2014are critical as they concentrate a large portion of coca crops and exhibit some of the highest levels of violence in the country. Transforming the most vulnerable territories is the best way to overcome criminality, violence, and illicit economies while consolidating the rule of law, democracy, and development.\nImproving the efficacy and legitimacy of state institutions in vulnerable territories and promoting rural development will benefit Colombia, the United States, and the binational partnership. Colombia has the potential to improve the lives of citizens who have long lived in precarious conditions, while also undermining illicit armed organizations and illicit economies that harm the entire country. By reducing drug trafficking and weakening criminal groups, institutional growth and rural development will also favor US national security interests while also enabling Colombia to continue its leading role in security cooperation in the region.\nUS-COLOMBIA PRIORITIES MOVING FORWARDTERRITORIAL CONTROL AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT\nCOLOMBIA \u2022    Adjust the PNIS to viably support all families that have signed and complied with the crop- substitution agreement. Possible adjustments include the delivery of subsidies in the initial phases of the program to ensure that farmers can pursue their licit productive project. In the initital years of production, the government should help peasants sell their licit products by connecting them with sellers or buying some of the production. Provision of technical assistance is also necessary. \u2022    Create a database or program that connects farmers interested in substituting coca crops with potential buyers. The current disconnect between potential suppliers of licit products with markets represents a major challenge to the crop-substitution program.\nUNITED STATES \u2022    Support the commercialization and facilitate market access to legal products that have substituted coca crops. They can be promoted and marketed as a special type of fair trade good.\nUS-COLOMBIA PARTNERSHIP\n\u2022    Invest in a long-term, multidimensional plan that includes security, justice, formalization of land property rights, education, public goods provision, and economic opportunities in ten priority areas to dismantle organized armed groups, eradicate rising coca crops, and fight drug trafficking. The ten priority municipalities identified by the Colombian government are included in the PDETs and are responsible for one-half of the entire national coca production.\n\u2022    Promote programs to train local and nonlocal public officials to serve in rural areas, offering support while in office to guarantee that characteristics of each locality are taken into account. These public servants could in turn train others and provide support in their first years serving in vulnerable localities.\n\u2022    Work to establish technology transfer and training programs, especially in the agricultural sector. For example, creating a \u201cfellows\u201d program to train Colombians on agricultural techniques for between six and twelve months in the United States under the condition that they return to Colombia to advise regional and local governments as well as farmers\u2019 organizations.\n\u2022    Foster partnerships between the Colombian and US private sectors and nongovernmental organizations to implement market-driven rural development projects, in coordination with the Colombian government.\n\u2022    Identify viable projects to combat illicit drug production in natural parks and lands owned by indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities. Projects in collectively owned lands must take into account the needs, preferences, and strengths of the communities that own them.\n\u2022    Channel additional resources to funds created by multilateral agencies and Colombia to transform vulnerable territories, help them transition to licit economies, and consolidate peace.\n\u2022    Conduct a rigorous assessment of all previous interventions in rural areas to determine how to best allocate development resources in the future.\nRural infrastructure is paramount to unleashing economic growth in rural areas, which is essential to decreasing coca cultivation, undermining other illicit economies, and weakening illegal armed groups while fostering legal economic activities. The United States needs rural Colombia to prosper in order to curb cocaine trafficking and undermine organized crime. However, Colombia has a severe lag in rural infrastructure. Public service delivery in the countryside is inadequate. Government statistics put electricity coverage at 80 percent of the nation, but aqueduct and sewage coverage trail at 20 percent and 6 percent, respectively. Moreover, 73 percent of rural areas in Colombia are more than three hours away from department capital cities by road.79Semana, \u201cMejores v\u00edas para el campo,\u201d October 4, 2018, https://www.semana.com/contenidos-editoriales/infraestructura-la-transformacion-de-un-pais/articulo/mejores-vias-para-el-campo/563113. Of the 142,000 kilometers (km) of existing rural roads, close to 65 percent are in bad shape and only 6 percent are paved.80Sim\u00f3n Gaviria Mu\u00f1oz, \u201cPol\u00edtica para la Gesti\u00f3n de la Red Terciaria: Prepuesto Informado por Resultados,\u201d PowerPoint Presentation, Deparamento Nacional de Planeaci\u00f3n, accessed on September 5, 2019, https://colaboracion.dnp.gov.co/CDT/Prensa/Presentaciones/RED%20TERCIARIA%20CCI%20-%20DNP.pdf.\nThis situation makes transport extremely costly both for individuals and for farmers seeking to get their agricultural products to markets. In addition, internet service barely reaches 10 percent in rural areas. Unsurprisingly, rural areas exhibit a poverty rate of 45 percent, almost twice the national average.81Gaviria Mu\u00f1oz, \u201cPol\u00edtica para la Gesti\u00f3n de la Red Terciaria.\u201d As part of the Rural Colombia program, President Duque allocated about $150 million to the improvement and maintenance of tertiary roads in 2019. This is a step in the right direction. Colombia must do more to connect rural areas and to improve rural infra.structure in order to expand economic opportunities for farmers, particularly in places with high coca cultivation or illicit mining.\nRecent public-private initiatives have worked to bring quality connectivity to rural areas in Colombia and encourage youth to stay in the countryside. Various projects, totaling $25 million and led by the Colombian Coffee Growers Federation, have focused on improving tertiary roads in 10 of the departments most affected by conflict (Cauca, Caldas, Antioquia, Nari\u00f1o, Valle del Cauca, Quind\u00edo, Cundinamarca, Huila, Risaralda and Santander).82\u201cFederaci\u00f3n Nacional de Cafeteros ejecutar\u00e1 obras en 10 departamentos,\u201d Federaci\u00f3n de Cafeteros, February 2018, https://www.federaciondecafeteros.org/pergamino-fnc/index.php/comments/federacion_nacional_de_cafeteros_ejecutara_obras_en_10_departamentos/. In another project, the Ministry of Information Technologies and other agencies, in association with Microsoft Corp., has allocated $1 million to increase the internet connectivity of farmers in certain coffee regions.\nThe United States needs rural Colombia to prosper in order to curb cocaine trafficking and undermine organized crime.\nLocals carry coffee in Gaitania, Tolima, Colombia. Increasing rural connectivity is paramount to unleashing economic growth in rural areas of Colombia. (REUTERS/Jaime Saldarriaga)\nThe private sector may have proved more efficient in providing certain services than the government, but going forward, successful public-private partnerships need to clearly align social and individual interests, carefully assign the risk involved, and remain transparent throughout the project. These schemes provide valuable examples of future projects the United States can help to replicate to increase rural connectivity, and, by so doing, create obstacles to the expansion of illegal armed groups and the illicit economies from which they profit.\nTo foster economic opportunities, create jobs, and guarantee the success of crop-substitution programs, rural areas must be accessible and connected to the rest of the country. Roads, especially secondary and tertiary ones, need to be built. In the last few years, the country has launched ambitious programs to build and improve both primary and tertiary roads. The \u201cfourth generation\u201d of road concessions (4G), as it is known in Colombia, is a megaroad public-private partnership program with aggregate capital expenditures of $15 billion83Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), \u201cOECD Economic Surveys: Colombia 2017,\u201d May 25, 2017, https://www.oecd.org/countries/colombia/oecd-economic-surveys-colombia-2017-eco-surveys-col-2017-en.htm. that seeks to build and rehabilitate approximately 8,000 km of the nation\u2019s most important primary roads. Despite multiple challenges, the program is moving forward and the Duque administration plans to finalize eight highways and significantly advance twenty-one more in the next four years.84Juan Camilo Montoya E., \u201cConcluir ocho autopistas 4G, meta del gobierno Duque,\u201d El Colombiano, May 27, 2019, https://www.elcolombiano.com/colombia/gobierno-duque-proyecta-concluir-ocho-autopistas-4g-DM10851750.\nThe United States could play a role in supporting the Duque administration\u2019s Rural Colombia program to advance secondary and tertiary roads,85\u201cConectamos a la Colombia Rural,\u201d Gobierno de Colombia, https://colombiarural.invias.gov.co/. which make up about 70 percent of all roads in the country. The United States can facilitate the involvement, presence, and financing of the DFC, which consolidates the Development Credit Authority (DCA) of USAID and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) in this process. USAID funds also could focus on a few, large-scale projects with long-term impacts on stabilization areas rather than on several small projects in multiple areas of the country. Moreover, USAID can replicate successful projects involving local populations in the maintenance of tertiary roads, with the long-term goal of creating capacity for future infrastructure projects in the locality.86Carlos Campos Cruz, and Management Systems International, \u201cModelo participativo de base comunitaria para la gesti\u00f3n de la red vial terciaria en Colombia,\u201d USAID/Colombia EVAL, October 28, 2016, https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00N1BD.pdf. The United States can also push for Colombia to be prioritized for a compact agreement with the Millennium Challenge Corporation, an independent US foreign assistance agency, to support the government\u2019s heavy financing burden. Connecting vulnerable communities to the rest of the country can only be accomplished, however, if Colombia finishes building its primary roads.\nUS-COLOMBIA PRIORITIES MOVING FORWARDINFRASTRUCTURE CONNECTIVITY\nUS-COLOMBIA PARTNERSHIP\n\u2022    Replicate successful projects involving local populations in the building and maintenance of secondary and tertiary roads, with the long-term goal of creating capacity for future infrastructure projects in the locality. The partnership should further facilitate the involvement of DFC and USAID as a potential source of financing for these projects.\n\u2022    Support public-private partnerships to increase connectivity in rural areas and create incentives for youth to remain in the countryside.\nBetween 2013 and 2017, coca crops in Colombia saw an exponential increase, rising from 80,500 hectares to 209,000 ha, according to the US Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP). The United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC) also reports a stark increase in coca crop cultivation, from 48,189 ha to 171,000 ha in that same time period. Between 2017 and 2018, after four years of continued increase, coca crop cultivation finally stabilized and slightly decreased, from 209,000 ha to 208,000 ha, according to ONDCP, and from 171,000 ha to 169,000 ha, according to UNODC. However, there is still much to be done.\nThe Colombian government\u2019s new drug policy, Ruta Futuro, which was mentioned earlier, is a holistic, multidimensional plan to combat drug challenges. Ruta Futuro focuses on five main pillars: reducing drug consumption; decreasing drug production; dismantling illegal organizations; attacking illicit economies and rents from organized crime; and transforming territories affected by illicit economies. The Colombian government is exploring multiple eradication tools, including returning to aerial spraying with glyphosate, a herbicide.\nIn 2015, Colombia\u2019s constitutional court prohibited aerial spraying with glyphosate due to potential health risks. The National Council on Narcotics (Consejo Nacional de Estupefacientes, CNE) endorsed the decision shortly afterwards. In 2017, the court issued a new sentence allowing the government to resume aerial spraying if several conditions were met, including providing \u201ca scientific investigation that, in an objective and conclusive manner, demonstrates the absence of damage to health and the environment.\u201d The lack of such conclusive, indisputable evidence has prevented aerial spraying since 2015.  For the past four years, the government has therefore utilized terrestrial eradication, both forceful and voluntary, as its main eradication strategy.\nIn July of this year, the Constitutional Court clarified its 2017 ruling stating that the government must corroborate that aerial spraying does not cause harm to public health or the environment but clarified that it does not have to demonstrate this with absolute and unquestionable certainty. It is now up to the CNE to evaluate existing evidence and make a decision. This means that President Duque might be able to resume aerial spraying with glyphosate. The Colombian government has stated that aerial fumigation will only be carried out when manual eradication is impossible and in cases where there is noncompliance with crop-substitution agreements.\nColombia should continue to lead the fight against coca cultivation and cocaine trafficking in the region by using a combination of the most cost-effective tools at its disposal, considering both material and social costs. Eradication works in the short run, but it fails as a long-term strategy unless it is articulated with other interventions that successfully transform local territories.87UNODC, \u201cColombia \u2013 Monitoreo de territorios afectados por cultivos il\u00edcitos 2018.\u201d Places where coca is eradicated can have coca crops growing again if structural conditions do not change. At the same time, eradication can simply push crops to more remote and inaccessible areas\u2014the so-called balloon effect\u2014unless the conditions in those territories also change.\nColombia should continue to lead the fight against coca cultivation and cocaine trafficking in the region by using a combination of the most cost-effective tools at its disposal, considering both material and social costs.\nColombia and the United States should therefore invest in long-term rural development as previously discussed. In addition, Colombia should continue to disrupt the necessary ingredients for the production of cocaine (gasoline, cement, arsenic and other chemicals), destroy laboratories, dismantle organized criminal groups, engage in interdiction activities, and combat money laundering. The United States should support Colombia not only in these activities but also in its efforts to modernize its ports and customs agencies to boost the country\u2019s capacity to control drug trafficking and money laundering.\nThe United States and Colombia have enjoyed a strong, constructive relationship between their law enforcement agencies in the ongoing battle against transnational crime and drug trafficking.  An important element in that relationship has been cooperation on extradition where warranted. We urge the law enforcement agencies of both nations to continue using the effective protocols they have relied on for several years with resounding success.\nRecognizing the importance of assessing what has worked and what has not, the US Congress in 2019 passed bipartisan legislation to create the Western Hemisphere Drug Policy Commission.88Committee on Foreign Affairs, \u201cEngel Launds Launch of Western Hemisphere Drug Policy Commission,\u201d US House of Representatives, May 22, 2019, https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/2019/5/engel-lauds-launch-of-western-hemisphere-drug-policy-commission. This independent government commission will study the successes and mistakes of US drug policy in the Western hemisphere. Its conclusions will be highly important to the US-Colombia partnership, as it should guide US drug policies and influence roles in the fight against drugs in the region.\nWith coca cultivation, cocaine consumption, and transnational drug trafficking groups on the rise, the Americas must take stock of existing policies at each stage in the chain, from production and trafficking to money laundering. What has worked in the past to reduce coca cultivation? Which interventions have proved more effective in weakening drug trafficking criminal organizations? Some studies suggest that targeting coca crops is less effective than focusing on the processing and trafficking stages. Since the participation of the coca leaf in the value chain is rather small (about 9 percent), devoting more efforts to trafficking (which concentrates about 70 percent of the cocaine profit chain) can be more efficient.89Zuleta, \u201cCoca, coca\u00edna y narcotr\u00e1fico.\u201d What is the estimated effect of a dollar spent on coca eradication vis-\u00e0-vis a dollar spent on interdiction? Is destroying labs an effective measure or are these easily and quickly rebuilt, as they are in Afghanistan?90W. J. Hennigan, \u201cThe U.S. Sent Its Most Advanced Fighter Jets to Blow Up Cheap Opium Labs. Now It\u2019s Canceling the Program,\u201d Time, February 21, 2019, https://time.com/5534783/iron-tempest-afghanistan-opium/. Is controlling precursor chemicals for cocaine production an effective strategy? What are the best barriers to money laundering? What are the most successful strategies to prevent drug use? Carefully considering the human and social cost of different interventions in all countries is also vital to devising effective solutions from a shared-responsibility perspective.\nThe United States and Colombia should also work together on the development of new technologies for decreasing coca crops as well as cocaine trafficking. Creating an innovation lab or hosting a formal call for proposals on innovative ways to reduce coca cultivation and cocaine trafficking could facilitate this process. Initiatives to devise new policies to curb trafficking of opioids91Department of Homeland Security, \u201c8 Finalists Announced in $1.55m Challenge for New Solutions to Detect Opioids in International Mail,\u201d June 11, 2019, https://www.dhs.gov/news/2019/06/11/8-finalists-announced-155m-challenge-new-solutions-detect-opioids-international-mail. could serve as a model for fostering innovation in drug policy in countries where cocaine is produced or trafficked. The countries involved in the production, trafficking, and consumption of illicit drugs in the region should also come together to look at the available evidence and apply lessons learned about counternarcotics policy design and implementation.\nAs more countries in Latin America become part of trafficking routes\u2014the list now includes, for example, Costa Rica92Douglas Marin, \u201cCosta Rica Becomes Hub of Drug Cartels,\u201d Latin American Herald Tribune, accessed on September 5, 2019, http://laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=349013&CategoryId=23558\u2014the region also needs to strengthen its coordination mechanisms. There are now more routes from South America to the United States through the Pacific Ocean than through the Caribbean,93Juan Diego Posada, \u201cTraffickers are turning the Pacific Ocean into a drug-smuggling superhighway,\u201d Business Insider, March 7, 2019, https://www.businessinsider.com/traffickers-are-turning-the-pacific-into-a-drug-smuggling-superhighway-2019-3. and Venezuela is playing an increasingly important role in the drug trade.94Nick Paton Walsh, Natalie Gall\u00f3n and Diana Castrillon, \u201cCorruption in Venezuela has created a cocaine superhighway to the US,\u201d CNN, April 17, 2019, https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/17/americas/venezuela-drug-cocaine-trafficking-intl/index.html. At the same time, trafficking from South America to Europe and Asia through Western Africa has been on the rise for years.95Sean Duncan, \u201cNarcotics trafficking through West African waters,\u201d Stable Seas, November 2, 2019, https://stableseas.org/illicit-trades/narcotics-trafficking-west-africa. Today, for every ton of cocaine the United States seized at its border with Mexico, Colombia seizes eighteen at its different borders.96Mar\u00eda Camila Roa, \u201cPor cada tonelada de coca\u00edna que decomisa EE.UU., Colombia incauta 18: Whitaker,\u201d BLU Radio, July 8, 2019, https://www.bluradio.com/nacion/por-cada-tonelada-de-cocaina-que-decomisa-eeuu-colombia-incauta-18-whitaker-219728-ie174\nThe United States can enhance its surveillance capacity in the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean through the existing maritime interdiction treaty including by increasing the presence of its vessels and patrol.  Strengthening regional coordination mechanisms for interdiction such as the Joint Interagency Task Force (JIATF) South and the Colombia International Maritime Center Against Narcotrafficking (CIMCON) could facilitate cooperation and increase efficacy. The United States should work with Colombia to strengthen its riverine and radar capabilities, surveillance, mobility, and interdiction assets such as helicopters and fast boats. The Colombian government could also create an agency that coordinates all efforts to fight drug trafficking with the support of ONDCP.\nInvolved countries should also discuss the indicators they rely on to measure success.\nWhile short-term goals are important, the region must consider policies that produce sustainable results. Since policies should change the structural conditions that facilitate the cultivation of illicit crops and trafficking of illicit substances, indicators of success should also include these outcomes. The efforts made by every country involved should also be measured and considered. The United States contributes to the fight against drugs with human capital, technological transfer, intelligence, military cooperation, and financial resources. Colombia contributes 80 percent of the monetary resources for the fight against drugs within and at its borders, with 20 percent coming through international cooperation. Colombia also contributes its institutional capacity and, crucially, risks the lives of military and police personnel as well as civilians. In the past nine years, more than 600 Colombians were wounded and 126 were killed in eradication operations,97Garz\u00f3n Vergara, Gelvez F., and Silva Aparicio, \u201cLos costos humanos de la erradicaci\u00f3n forzada \u00bfes el glifosato la soluci\u00f3n?\u201d and hundreds of thousands have been killed in the different cycles of violence linked to drug trafficking that the country has endured in the past four decades.98\u201cEstad\u00edsticas del conflicto armado en Colombia,\u201d Centro Nacional de Memoria Hist\u00f3rica, accessed on September 5, 2019, http://www.centrodememoriahistorica.gov.co/micrositios/informeGeneral/estadisticas.html. Having clear estimates of these efforts is important as the region discusses options and shared responsibilities.\nFinally, as levels of cocaine consumption remain high in the United States and are increasing both in Central and South America, the  United States and Colombia should implement domestic programs to prevent and reduce consumption among youth. The US-Colombia partnership should also encourage other consuming countries to devise national plans to prevent and reduce consumption.\nUS-COLOMBIA PRIORITIES MOVING FORWARDSTEPS TO ADDRESS THE WORLD DRUG PROBLEM COLOMBIA\nCOLOMBIA\n\u2022    Cut coca cultivation and production in half by 2023 using a combination of the most cost-effective tools at its disposal.\n\u2022    The Colombian government, with the support of ONDCP, should also create an agency that coordinates all efforts to fight drug trafficking in the country.\nUNITED STATES\n\u2022    Increase financial and technical support, military cooperation, and intelligence assistance to combat the world drug problem. For example, the United States can increase the presence of its vessels and patrol in the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean.\nUS-COLOMBIA PARTNERSHIP\n\u2022    Create an innovation lab or host a formal call for proposals on innovative ways to reduce coca crops and cocaine trafficking.\n\u2022    Strengthen regional coordination mechanisms for interdiction such as the Joint Interagency Task Force (JIATF) South and the Colombia International Maritime Center Against Narcotrafficking (CIMCON) to double down on the fight against drugs.\n\u2022    Collaborate to strengthen Colombia\u2019s riverine and radar capabilities, surveillance, mobility, and interdiction assets such as helicopters and fast boats.\n\u2022    Countries involved in the production, trafficking, and consumption of illicit drugs in the region should come together to look at the available evidence and apply lessons learned about counternarcotics policy design and implementation, and devise stronger and more holistic measures of success.\n\u2022    Work to modernize Colombia\u2019s ports and customs agencies to boost the country\u2019s capacity to fight drug trafficking and money laundering.\n\u2022    Implement programs to prevent and reduce consumption among youth in Colombia and the United States and encourage other consuming countries to devise national plans for this same purpose.\nAlthough overall levels of violence have decreased in Colombia in recent years,99El Colombiano, \u201cTasa de homicidios en Colombia en 2017 es la m\u00e1s baja en 30 a\u00f1os,\u201d December 26, 2017, https://www.elcolombiano.com/colombia/tasa-de-homicidios-en-colombia-bajo-en-2017-GX7918080. a new wave of violence against human rights defenders, community leaders, and social activists is spreading across several regions in the country. The targeting of social leaders started to escalate in 2016 and surged in 2018 and the first semester of 2019. Although estimates of the total number of murders vary across sources, Colombia\u2019s Ombudsman\u2019s Office reports 317 victims from January 2016 to April 2019,100Rodr\u00edguez G\u00f3mez, \u201cM\u00e1s de 317 l\u00edderes sociales han sido asesinados en el \u00faltimo a\u00f1o: Medicina Legal.\u201d most of whom were peasants, Afro-Colombians, or indigenous persons. The United States has a firm commitment to the defense of human rights. As a major partner of Colombia, it is deeply concerned about these crimes and willing to support Colombia in its efforts to find a solution.\nIn early 2019, Colombia\u2019s Office of the Attorney General characterized the killing of social leaders as systematic acts, which are usually perpetrated by organized criminal groups. About 14 percent of these assassinations were reported in areas with coca crops. The attacks seem to be related to vendettas and competition between different criminal groups101Mininterior, \u201cPlan de acci\u00f3n oportuna de prevenci\u00f3n y protecci\u00f3n para los defensores de derechos humanos, l\u00edderes sociales, comunales y periodistas,\u201d accessed on September 5, 2019, https://www.mininterior.gov.co/sites/default/files/plan_de_accion_oportuna_de_prevencion_y_proteccion_0.pdf as well as conflicts over land, and illicit economies such as drug trafficking, coca cultivation, and illegal mining.102Mininterior, \u201cPlan de acci\u00f3n oportuna de prevenci\u00f3n y protecci\u00f3n para los defensores de derechos humanos, l\u00edderes sociales, comunales y periodistas.\u201d Some of the victims were leaders who opposed coca cultivation or who had joined crop-substitution programs. Emilio Archila, Colombia\u2019s High Commissioner of Peace, cited in July 2019 that 58 leaders of the PNIS program have been assassinated since the signing of the Peace Agreement in 2016.103Redacci\u00f3n Colombia 2020, \u201cLas medidas del Gobierno para proteger a l\u00edderes de sustituci\u00f3n de cultivos,\u201d El Espectador, July 16, 2019, https://www.elespectador.com/colombia2020/pais/las-medidas-del-gobierno-para-proteger-lideres-de-sustitucion-de-cultivos-articulo-871222.\nPresident Duque developed and is currently implementing a new plan to protect human rights defenders, titled Timely Action Plan on Prevention and Protection for Human Rights Defenders, Social Leaders, and Journalists (Plan de Acci\u00f3n Oportuna de Prevenci\u00f3n y Protecci\u00f3n para los Defensores de Derechos Humanos, L\u00edderes Sociales y Comunales, or PAO). This plan is built on three strategic pillars. The first pillar, articulation and institutional re-engineering, aims to articulate the work of multiple agencies and norms. The second pillar, strategic action in the territory, focuses on municipalities that have widespread criminal activities and inadequate institutional responses to their needs. Finally, the third pillar, communication strategy and training, entails implementing a campaign to counteract the stigmatization of the status of \u201csocial leader\u201d as well as to publicize existing protection and self-protection programs. The Colombian government should work with national and international civil society organizations that have been monitoring the situation of social leaders and human rights defenders in Colombia to develop a progress report for the PAO. This report should include an evaluation of progress as well as clear follow-up mechanisms.\nThis new wave of violence has not only appalled Colombians, it has also sparked concern among US legislators104US Congress, Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, Hearing on Peace and Victims\u2019 Rights in Colombia, 116th Cong. (2019), https://humanrightscommission.house.gov/events/hearings/peace-and-victims-rights-colombia. and the international community more broadly.105Albiol Marina et al., \u201cLetter to European Parliament\u2019s Hon.

The assassination of social leaders is not only a human rights violation, it is also a stab to democratic representation, civil society, rural development, and peace. A threat to democracy and security in Colombia is a threat to US interests in the region as it undermines stability, decreases Colombia\u2019s capacity to continue its role in addressing the crisis in Venezuela, and undermines its potential security cooperation with the region. The United States should support Colombia\u2019s efforts to protect social leaders and end impunity by continuing to support the Attorney General\u2019s Office in cases of human rights abuses. Moreover, it could assist with intelligence to help prevent these killings and offer financial assistance to President Duque\u2019s Timely Action Plan on Prevention and Protection.\nUS-COLOMBIA PRIORITIES MOVING FORWARDPROTECTING SOCIAL LEADERS AND HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS\nUNITED STATES\n\u2022    Continue supporting the Attorney General\u2019s Office in cases of human rights abuses and provide intelligence assistance to help prevent crimes against social leaders and human rights defenders.

Over four million people have fled Venezuela between 2015 and June 2019.106\u201cSituaci\u00f3n en Venezuela,\u201d United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, accessed on September 5, 2019, https://www.acnur.org/situacion-en-venezuela.html. This number is growing exponentially as conditions continue to deteriorate in Venezuela. From February 2019 to June 2019, the number of migrants increased by 17.6 percent to four million from 3.4 million. Estimates show that by the end of 2019, 5.3 million Venezuelans will have fled the country\u2014a 32.5 percentage increase in only six months.107USAID, \u201cVenezuela Regional Crisis,\u201d April 10, 2019, https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1866/04.10.19_-_USG_Venezuela_Regional_Crisis_Fact_Sheet_2.pdf. By 2020, the total number of Venezuelan migrants and refugees could reach between 7.5 million and 8.2 million.108OAS Working Group, \u201cPreliminary Report on the Venezuelan Migrant and Refugee Crisis in the Region,\u201d Organization of American States, March 8, 2019, http://www.oas.org/documents/eng/press/Preliminary-Report-2019-on-Venezuelan-Migrant-and-Refugee-Crisis-in-the-Region.pdf. This means that the Venezuelan exodus will surpass the Syrian refugee crisis, which displaced 6.3 million people between 2011 and 2017. If unmanaged, the mass migration of Venezuelans can destabilize the entire Western Hemisphere.\nColombia is the largest recipient of Venezuelan migrants, having received more than 1.4 million migrants as of June 2019.109\u201cVenezolanos en Colombia.\u201d Almost 64 percent of Venezuelans in Colombia are concentrated in five departments: Bogot\u00e1, Capital District (315,528 migrants, 22.3 percent of the total); Norte de Santander (185,433, 13.2 percent); La Guajira (163,966, 11.6 percent); Atl\u00e1ntico (125,075, 8.9 percent); and Antioquia (112,745, 8 percent).110\u201cVenezolanos en Colombia.\u201d These numbers will continue to rise as migration flows intensify in the coming months and years. By 2021, Colombian authorities expect the number of Venezuelan migrants in Colombia to reach four million, which would represent about 7.7 percent of the population.111Julia Symmes Cobb, \u201cFour million Venezuelans may live in Colombia by 2021: minister,\u201d Reuters, October 2, 2018, https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-migration-colombia/four-million-venezuelans-may-live-in-colombia-by-2021-minister-idUSKCN1MC2NZ.\nUnless the conditions pushing people to flee Venezuela (namely, the current political and economic crisis) change, the massive influx of Venezuelans will reach unprecedented proportions and host countries will be increasingly strained to address the needs of migrants and refugees. The foreign minister of Colombia, Carlos Holmes Trujillo, has already said that Colombia can no longer deal with the Venezuelan influx if the amount of international funding does not increase.\nColombia should be showcased as a global model of solidarity and commitment to helping a neighbor in crisis.\nVenezuelans stand at the Rumichaca border bridge while trying to cross into Ecuador from Colombia, after new visa restrictions from the Ecuadorian government took effect in August 2019. (REUTERS/Daniel Tapia)\nColombia has demonstrated tremendous generosity and has taken extraordinary measures to address the basic needs of incoming Venezuelans. With its \u201copen door\u201d policy, Colombia\u2019s government is recognizing that both countries\u2019 histories and destinies are irrevocably intertwined. When Colombia\u2019s conflict reached a newfound intensity in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, Colombians migrated to neighboring Venezuela looking to improve their economic and security situation. According to Marco Romero Silva, director at the Consultancy for Human Rights and Displacement (CODHES), millions of Colombians are believed to have fled to Venezuela, but specific statistics are unknown due to irregular migrant flows.112Megan Janetsky, \u201cHere\u2019s Why Colombia Opened Its Arms to Venezuelan Migrants\u2014Until Now,\u201d Foreign Policy, January 14, 2019, https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/01/14/heres-why-colombia-opened-its-arms-to-venezuelan-migrants-until-now/. This reveals the regional spillover effect of instability, democratic breakdown, increased violence, or economic stagnation in one country.\nThe Colombian government has adopted a policy of complete solidarity toward Venezuelan migrants,113CONPES, \u201c\u201cEstrategia Para La Atenci\u00f3n de la Migraci\u00f3n desde Venezuela.\u201d implementing a series of measures to assist them. A special focus has been given to migrants in border municipalities (C\u00facuta, Maicao, Arauca and Puerto Carre\u00f1o) and major cities (Bogot\u00e1, Medell\u00edn, Bucaramanga, among others) where the situation is most critical. Between 2017 and 2019, 273,000 Venezuelans were treated in the Colombian health system, 156,000 Venezuelan children and youth were enrolled in publicly funded schools, and 62,000 Venezuelans had access to public protection programs and child and family welfare services.114Data provided by the office of Colombia\u2019s Venezuela Border Czar. The Duque administration has also made a commendable effort to regularize the legal status of Venezuelan migrants and integrate them into the labor force, offering a temporary protected status (the PEP, or Permiso Especial de Permanencia) to almost 600,000 migrants, which gives them access to legal employment, healthcare, and education.115\u201cVenezolanos en Colombia.\u201d Recently, the government granted nationality to 24,000 children born to Venezuelan parents in Colombian territory. Previously, these children were in a condition of statelessness\u2014neither Colombia nor Venezuela recognized them as nationals.\nThe Colombian government is launching other policies and initiatives to facilitate the integration of Venezuelans into Colombia\u2019s society and economy. Colombia should be showcased as a global model of solidarity and commitment to helping a neighbor in crisis. The leadership that the country has demonstrated is admirable and should be further backed by the international community\u2014in diplomatic, technical, and financial support\u2014to achieve a peaceful democratic transition in Venezuela and put an end to this regional migratory and humanitarian crisis. Continued engagement with the Lima Group regional bloc, of which Colombia is a member, will be critical in this quest.\nNaturally, the Venezuelan migration crisis is placing significant strains on Colombia\u2019s economy as well as its healthcare and education systems. A 2018 country report by the World Bank estimates that Colombia\u2019s fiscal costs associated with the influx of Venezuelans are approximately 0.4 percent of GDP in 2019.116The World Bank, \u201cUS$31.5 Million to Help Improve Services for Migrants from Venezuela and Host Communities in Colombia.\u201d Fiscal costs will peak in 2020 as a result of Colombia\u2019s efforts to provide migrants and refugees with access to quality healthcare, education, housing, and other basic needs. These costs represent a major economic strain for a country working to implement a peace agreement and seeking to secure institutional control of all its territory. The United States and Colombia should create a task force of experts to calculate the exact fiscal impact and funding that Colombia will require to successfully absorb the growing number of Venezuelan migrants and refugees. This is a necessary step to developing a sound response strategy to the situation in the short, medium, and long term.\nAt the same time, Colombia has almost eight million internally displaced people, and, despite the peace accord with the FARC, violence and criminality continue to strike a large portion of its territory. That peace deal is further threatened by the Maduro regime, which has welcomed with open arms Jes\u00fas Santrich and Iv\u00e1n Marquez, former senior FARC leaders. Venezuelan territory is now used as a launching point and safe haven for criminal organizations to mount attacks inside Colombia. These security concerns reinforce the need for appropriate funding for Colombia in the midst of a wave of migrants and refugees.\nIn late 2018, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organization for Migration announced the Regional Refugee and Migrant Response Plan (RRM Response Plan) and asked for $738 million in funding to assist 2.7 million Venezuelan migrants in Latin America between January and December 2019.117\u201c2019 Regional Refugee and Migrant Response Plan for Refugees and Migrants from Venezuela,\u201d United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, accessed on September 5, 2019, http://reporting.unhcr.org/node/21600?_ga=2.263278924.1937849855.1566829714-1981709478.1566829714. However, by July 2019, only 23.7 percent of this request had been fulfilled.118United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, \u201cVenezuela Situation,\u201d June 2019, http://reporting.unhcr.org/sites/default/files/UNHCR%20Update%20on%20Venezuela%20Situation%20-%20June%202019.pdf Considering that USAID estimates migrants and refugees to reach 5.3 million by the end of 2019, this level of funding, even if fully met, is largely insufficient. The United States and Colombia should call on the international donor community to fully fund the UN\u2019s funding request.\nFor Colombia specifically, the RRM Response Plan allocates $315.5 million in funding, of which only about 30 percent has been fulfilled. This response plan estimates that around 1.1 million refugees and migrants will need assistance in Colombia in 2019. These estimates are much lower than USAID\u2019s calculations, which show a total of 1.9 million people in Colombia in need of assistance as a result of the Venezuela regional crisis.119USAID, \u201cVenezuela Regional Crisis.\u201d Total US government funding to Colombia for the Venezuela regional response in FY 2018 and FY 2019 amounts to $89.9 million.120USAID, \u201cVenezuela Regional Crisis.\u201d\nAlthough critical, current international aid to Colombia is insufficient given the prolonged nature of the crisis and the growing number of migrants and refugees crossing the border. According to Colombian Foreign Minister Trujillo, Colombia has received international funds that equate to approximately $68 per migrant, significantly lower than the $500 to $900 donated per person for migrants and refugees from Syria, South Sudan, and Myanmar.121Al Jazeera, \u201cColombia: International aid for Venezuelan migrants is too low,\u201d August 20, 2019, https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/colombia-international-aid-venezuelan-migrants-190820210642930.html. The international community should increase its financial, diplomatic, and technical support to Colombia as it plays a leadership role in responding to the Venezuela situation.\nSpecifically, the United States can support Colombia\u2019s efforts by enhancing the country\u2019s technology to gather and process data on Venezuelans crossing the border. This assistance will not only enhance security but also facilitate the integration process of migrants and refugees into the Colombian economy and society. Technology assistance should be accompanied by training to local authorities on how to design and implement effective systems for migration and integration.\nThe US-Colombia partnership should also combat disinformation around the Venezuela regional crisis, manage public misconceptions about migrants, and prevent the rise of xenophobia and discrimination. Xenophobic sentiments and attitudes toward migrants are driven by the misconception that migrants pose security threats, drain national resources, and take away jobs from local workers. However, studies specific to Colombia show that crime does not increase in areas with a higher number of Venezuelan migrants,122Fundaci\u00f3n Ideas para la Paz, \u201cSeguridad ciudadana y migraci\u00f3n venezolana,\u201d January 27, 2019, http://www.ideaspaz.org/publications/posts/1722. and migration can have positive effects on the national economy of host countries.\nAlthough critical, current international aid to Colombia is insufficient given the prolonged nature of the crisis and the growing number of migrants and refugees crossing the border.\nIf properly integrated into the formal labor market, Venezuelan migrants can make many contributions to the economy of recipient countries: filling formal sector labor shortages and expanding the labor supply; creating formal jobs through their own entrepreneurship; raising GDP with increased consumption of goods and services; and expanding government tax revenues.123Michael Clemens, Cindy Huang, and Jimmy Graham, \u201cThe Economic and Fiscal Effects of Granting Refugees Formal Labor Market Access,\u201d Center for Global Development, 2018, https://www.cgdev.org/publication/economic-and-fiscal-effects-granting-refugees-formal-labor-market-access-brief. The Colombian government, in partnership with civil society and private-sector companies, should conduct campaigns to inform the population about the Venezuela regional crisis, combat the narrative that migrants pose threats to national security, and explain the positive economic impacts of regularizing Venezuelan\u2019s migrant status and incorporating  them into the labor force.\nAs a result of Venezuela\u2019s democratic breakdown and deteriorating security and economic conditions, the Colombia-Venezuela border has become a hub for criminal activities of all kinds, which provide a source of funding to the Maduro regime and threaten regional stability. Undermining these illegal activities will put new financial pressures on the Maduro regime and weaken its support. The US-Colombia partnership should devote further resources to combatting illegal activities and illicit armed groups in the border areas.\nVenezuela also now serves as a key transit point for drug shipments coming from Colombia to the United States and Europe. As a result, several armed groups are competing for control of drug trafficking routes and other contraband flows, which inevitably generates increased levels of violence and leads to human rights violations. The National Liberation Army (known by its Spanish acronym, ELN), FARC dissidents, and the Popular Liberation Army (known by its Spanish acronym,  EPL) have been the major actors controlling the smuggling and trafficking market in the Colombia-Venezuela border.124Venezuela Investigative Unit, \u201cShifting Criminal Dynamics Signal Violent Future for Colombia-Venezuela Border,\u201d InSight Crime, January 29, 2018, https://www.insightcrime.org/news/analysis/shifting-criminal-dynamics-violence-colombia-venezuela-border/. With the unfolding of the political, economic, and social crisis in Venezuela, other armed groups have emerged in the border region: criminal gangs such as \u201cLa Linea,\u201d Venezuelan paramilitaries known as \u201cColectivos,\u201d and Colombian drug-trafficking groups such as the \u201cRastrojos,\u201d the \u201cUrabe\u00f1os,\u201d and the \u201cbandas criminales\u201d or BACRIM.125Venezuela Investigative Unit, \u201cColombia-Venezuela Border Reopens, But Hidden Trails Still Hotspots,\u201d InSight Crime, June 26, 2019, https://www.insightcrime.org/news/brief/colombia-venezuela-border-reopens-but-hidden-trails-still-hotspots/. In the past decade, the United States has also reported the involvement of Hezbollah, the armed wing of the Lebanese Shiite Muslim political party, with drug-trafficking activities in Venezuela.126Colin P. Clarke, \u201cHezbollah Is in Venezuela to Stay,\u201d Foreign Policy, February 9, 2019, https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/02/09/hezbollah-is-in-venezuela-to-stay/. In addition to the illicit trade of drugs along the border, armed groups are engaging in illegal mining, arms trafficking, contraband fuel and gold trade, human smuggling and trafficking, kidnapping, extortion, and money laundering. Oil and crude smuggled from Venezuela into Colombia alone have a value of between $1.5 billion and $3 billion per year.127Mark Hay, \u201cInside the Illicit Venezuela-Colombia Gas Smuggling Trade,\u201d Vice News, August 24, 2016, https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vdqvb4/inside-the-illicit-venezuela-colombia-gas-smuggling-trade. The United States can contribute to border control by providing Colombia with better technology to monitor and secure the border including sensors and drones.\nAs the political and economic crisis in Venezuela worsens and migration flows intensify, Venezuelan migrants are increasingly at risk of being recruited by illicit armed groups. Vulnerable populations are the most susceptible to forceful or voluntary recruitment by criminal organizations. Venezuelan migrants and refugees, including children and teenagers, have already been recruited by the BACRIM,128Caracol Radio, \u201cVenezolanos est\u00e1n siendo reclutados por bandas criminales colombianas en la frontera,\u201d December 21, 2015, https://caracol.com.co/emisora/2015/12/21/cucuta/1450730614_548873.html. the ELN, FARC dissidents, and the EPL129Juan Carlos Garz\u00f3n Vergara et al., \u201cInseguridad, Violencia y Econom\u00edas Ilegales en las Fronteras,\u201d Fundaci\u00f3n Ideas para la Paz, 2018, http://ideaspaz.org/media/website/fip_seguridad_fronteras.pdf. as combatants, smugglers, informants, or hitmen. Additionally, a vast number of Venezuelan migrants, especially women and children, are falling prey to gross transitional crimes and human rights violations, including extortion, rape, human smuggling, and human trafficking. The United States and Colombia have a vested interest in working together to prevent such recruitments. This collaboration should include intelligence sharing and working together to provide for development of Colombia\u2019s rural areas\u2014the core of the peace accord\u2014to counteract the conditions that breed the rise and expansion of criminal organizations.\nThe Venezuelan crisis has profound implications for the prospect of peace in Colombia, US national security interests, and regional stability. The United States and the international community should therefore increase their financial assistance to Colombia to support its efforts to absorb more than 1.4 million Venezuelans. Although responding to the immediate humanitarian needs of Venezuelans is vital, future assistance should focus on their medium- and long-term integration into host countries.\nEvents inside Venezuela bear implications for the rest of Latin America, the United States, Europe, and beyond. Most timely for Colombia is receiving both the resources to manage the inflow of migrants and refugees and the assistance to combat criminal organizations that operate out of Venezuela and launch attacks in Colombian territory. A strong security component, in particular, is needed as the nonstate armed actors operating in Venezuela and along its borders pose significant challenges to Venezuela\u2019s stabilization and return to democracy. These groups already threaten peace and security in Colombia.\nAt the same time, Colombia, given its experience with nonstate armed groups, should work closely with the Venezuelan interim government to implement and enhance the security components of the National Assembly\u2019s Plan Pa\u00eds stabilization and reconstruction plan. The US-Colombia partnership can further support the interim government\u2019s democratic restoration plans by creating a task force with international experts on stabilization of territories and the transition to democracy. Task force members with security expertise could provide intelligence cooperation to the Venezuelan interim government, as well as advice on how to promote rule of law and strengthen national institutions.\nGiven the fragility of political transitions, Colombia and the United States should assist Venezuela to peacefully restore democracy. To do so, the United States should work with Colombia to strengthen Colombia\u2019s internal institutions and devise a ten-year national plan to better support the interim government in the reconstruction of Venezuela.\nUS-COLOMBIA PRIORITIES MOVING FORWARDTHE VENEZUELAN REGIONAL CRISIS\nCOLOMBIA \u2022    Continue to play a leadership role in the international arena to achieve a peaceful democratic transition in Venezuela. Do so specifically through continued engagement with the Lima Group regional bloc. \u2022    Continue working to assist and integrate Venezuelan migrants and refugees crossing the border by regularizing the legal status and granting work permits \u2022    Conduct campaigns to inform the population about the Venezuela regional crisis, combat xenophobic narratives and discrimination, and explain the positive economic impacts of integrating Venezuelan migrants into the Colombian economy and society.\nUNITED STATES \u2022    Increase its financial, diplomatic, and technical support to Colombia as it plays a leadership role in responding to the Venezuela situation. Examples of technology assistance include:\na) Enhancing Colombia\u2019s existing capacity to gather and process data on Venezuelan migrants crossing the border. This will not only help manage security threats but also facilitate the social and economic integration of Venezuelan migrants.\nb) Contribute to border control by working with Colombia to deploy sensors, drones, and other monitoring technologies in the Colombia-Venezuela border area.\nUS-COLOMBIA PARTNERSHIP \u2022    Ask the international donor community to fully fund the $738 million requested by the UN to help Colombia respond to the Venezuelan migration crisis. \u2022    Create a Task Force on stabilization of territories and transitions to democracy and include international experts who can provide intelligence cooperation to the Venezuelan interim government and advice on how to promote rule of law and strengthen national institutions. \u2022    Create a Task Force of experts to calculate the exact fiscal impact on and funding needed by Colombia to absorb the growing number of Venezuelan migrants and refugees.\nReturn to table of contents\ufeff\nFor decades, the strategic alliance between Colombia and the United States has focused on, and succeeded in, safeguarding both nations\u2019 most pressing security interests. Today, with Colombia\u2019s improved security situation, strengthened economy, and increased regional leadership, the bilateral relationship is expanding to also include mutually beneficial and deepened economic and diplomatic interactions.\nA strengthened and modernized US-Colombia partnership involves deepening bilateral trade and investment, promoting rural development in Colombia, cooperating to find a solution to the world drug problem, and finding a peaceful solution to the Venezuela regional crisis. Solidifying the strategic partnership along these pillars will allow Colombia and the United States to advance their national security and economic and geopolitical interests, while also promoting regional stability and strengthening democratic institutions throughout the Western Hemisphere. In this report, the Atlantic Council\u2019s US-Colombia Task Force developed a roadmap for action that provides targeted, fresh ideas on how to strengthen bilateral cooperation in these areas.\nThe multisectoral, nonpartisan, bicameral, and binational nature of the task force has enabled it to devise concrete and actionable recommendations that provide the Duque administration, the Trump administration, and the US Congress with a comprehensive and multifaced strategy. If embraced, Colombia will move forward in its path toward peace and prosperity, the United States will reap the security and economic benefits of its $11 billion Plan Colombia investment, and the region will experience the stabilizing effect of a deepened and strategic US-Colombia alliance.\nTo succeed, a renewed US-Colombia partnership must be sustained, nonpartisan, and adequately resourced. Colombia still faces a number of challenges, intensified by the mass influx of Venezuelan migrants and refugees, and the United States stands in a unique position to help Colombia manage these challenges. In today\u2019s interconnected world, stability and prosperity in Colombia will directly benefit the United States. This is especially true given Colombia\u2019s leadership around the Venezuela regional crisis, its strategic cooperation with the United States on global security, and its privileged geopolitical position to manage extrahemispheric interventions in the region. Today more than ever, the United States should work with one of its strongest global allies to advance both nations\u2019 security, economic, and political interests.\nReturn to table of contents\ufeff\nCO-CHAIRS\nThe Hon.

AM-\u0259-zon UK also /\u02c8\u00e6m\u0259z\u0259n/ AM-\u0259-z\u0259n) is an American multinational technology company focusing on e-commerce, cloud computing, online advertising, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence. It has been often referred to as \"one of the most influential economic and cultural forces in the world\",[5] and is often regarded as one of the world's most valuable brands.[6] It is considered as one of the Big Five American technology companies, alongside Alphabet (parent company of Google), Apple, Meta (formerly  Facebook Inc.) and Microsoft.\nAmazon was founded by Jeff Bezos from his garage in Bellevue, Washington,[7] on July 5, 1994. Initially an online marketplace for books, it has expanded into a multitude of product categories, a strategy that has earned it the moniker The Everything Store.[8] It has multiple subsidiaries including Amazon Web Services (cloud computing), Zoox (autonomous vehicles), Kuiper Systems (satellite Internet), and Amazon Lab126 (computer hardware R&D). Its other subsidiaries include Ring, Twitch, IMDb, and Whole Foods Market. Its acquisition of Whole Foods in August 2017 for US$13.4\u00a0billion substantially increased its footprint as a physical retailer.[9]\nAmazon has earned a reputation as a disruptor of well-established industries through technological innovation and \"aggressive\" reinvestment of profits into capital expenditures.[10][11][12][13] As of 2023[update], it is the world's largest online retailer and marketplace, smart speaker provider, cloud computing service through AWS,[14] live-streaming service through Twitch, and Internet company as measured by revenue and market share.[15] In 2021, it surpassed Walmart as the world's largest retailer outside of China, driven in large part by its paid subscription plan, Amazon Prime, which has over 200\u00a0million subscribers worldwide.[16][17] It is the second-largest private employer in the United States.[18]\nAmazon also distributes a variety of downloadable and streaming content through its Amazon Prime Video, Amazon Music, Twitch, and Audible units. It publishes books through its publishing arm, Amazon Publishing, film and television content through Amazon Studios, and has been the owner of film and television studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer since March 2022. It also produces consumer electronics\u2014most notably, Kindle e-readers, Echo devices, Fire tablets, and Fire TVs.\nAmazon has been criticized for customer data collection practices,[19] a toxic work culture,[20] tax avoidance,[21][22] and anti-competitive behavior.[23][24]\nAmazon was founded on July 5, 1994, by Jeff Bezos, who chose the Seattle area for its abundance of technical talent, as Microsoft was in the area.[25]\nAmazon went public in May 1997. It began selling music and videos in 1998, and began international operations by acquiring online sellers of books in the United Kingdom and Germany. The following year, it began selling music, video games, consumer electronics, home improvement items, software, games, and toys.[26][27]\nIn 2002, it launched Amazon Web Services (AWS), which initially focused on providing APIs for web developers to build web applications on top of Amazon's ecommerce platform.[28][29] In 2004, AWS was expanded to provide website popularity statistics and web crawler data from the Alexa Web Information Service.[30] AWS later shifted toward providing enterprise services with Simple Storage Service (S3) in 2006,[31] and Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) in 2008,[32] allowing companies to rent data storage and computing power from Amazon. In 2006, Amazon also launched the Fulfillment by Amazon program, which allowed individuals and small companies (called \"third-party sellers\") to sell products through Amazon's warehouses and fulfillment infrastructure.[33]\nAmazon purchased the Whole Foods Market supermarket chain in 2017.[34]\nAmazon saw large growth during the COVID-19 pandemic, hiring more than 100,000 staff in the US and Canada.[35] Some Amazon workers in the US, France, and Italy protested the company's decision to \"run normal shifts\" due to COVID-19's ease of spread in warehouses.[36][37] In Spain, the company faced legal complaints over its policies,[38] while a group of US Senators wrote an open letter to Bezos expressing concerns about workplace safety.[39]\nOn February 2, 2021, Bezos announced that would step down as CEO to become executive chair of Amazon's board. The transition officially took place on July 5, 2021, with former CEO of AWS Andy Jassy replacing him as CEO.[40][41] In January 2023, Amazon cut over 18,000 jobs, primarily in consumer retail and its human resources division in an attempt to cut costs.[42]\nAmazon.com is an ecommerce platform that sells many product lines, including media (books, movies, music, and software), apparel, baby products, consumer electronics, beauty products, gourmet food, groceries, health and personal care products, industrial & scientific supplies, kitchen items, jewelry, watches, lawn and garden items, musical instruments, sporting goods, tools, automotive items, toys and games, and farm supplies[44] and consulting services.[45] Amazon websites are country-specific (for example, amazon.com for the U.S. and amazon.fr for France), though some offer international shipping.[46]\nVisits to amazon.com grew from 615\u00a0million annual visitors in 2008,[47] to more than 2 billion per month in 2022.[48] The ecommerce platform is the 14th most visited website in the world.[49]\nResults generated by Amazon's search engine are partly determined by promotional fees.[50] The company's localized storefronts, which differ in selection and prices, are differentiated by top-level domain and country code:\nIn 2000, U.S. toy retailer Toys \"R\" Us entered into a 10-year agreement with Amazon, valued at $50\u00a0million per year plus a cut of sales, under which Toys \"R\" Us would be the exclusive supplier of toys and baby products on the service, and the chain's website would redirect to Amazon's Toys & Games category. In 2004, Toys \"R\" Us sued Amazon, claiming that because of a perceived lack of variety in Toys \"R\" Us stock, Amazon had knowingly allowed third-party sellers to offer items on the service in categories that Toys \"R\" Us had been granted exclusivity. In 2006, a court ruled in favor of Toys \"R\" Us, giving it the right to unwind its agreement with Amazon and establish its independent e-commerce website. The company was later awarded $51 million in damages.[54][55][56]\nIn 2001, Amazon entered into a similar agreement with Borders Group, under which Amazon would comanage Borders.com as a co-branded service.[57] Borders pulled out of the arrangement in 2007, with plans to also launch its own online store.[58]\nOn October 18, 2011, Amazon.com announced a partnership with DC Comics for the exclusive digital rights to many popular comics, including Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, The Sandman, and Watchmen. The partnership has caused well-known bookstores like Barnes & Noble to remove these titles from their shelves.[59]\nIn November 2013, Amazon announced a partnership with the United States Postal Service to begin delivering orders on Sundays. The service, included in Amazon's standard shipping rates, initiated in metropolitan areas of Los Angeles and New York because of the high-volume and inability to deliver in a timely way, with plans to expand into Dallas, Houston, New Orleans and Phoenix by 2014.[60]\nIn June 2017, Nike agreed to sell products through Amazon in exchange for better policing of counterfeit goods.[61][62] This proved unsuccessful and Nike withdrew from the partnership in November 2019.[62][63] Companies including IKEA and Birkenstock also stopped selling through Amazon around the same time, citing similar frustrations over business practices and counterfeit goods.[64]\nIn September 2017, Amazon ventured with one of its sellers JV Appario Retail owned by Patni Group which has recorded a total income of US$\u2009104.44\u2009million (\u20b9759 \u2009crore) in financial year 2017\u20132018.[65]\nAs of October\u00a011, 2017[update], AmazonFresh sold a range of Booths branded products for home delivery in selected areas.[66]\nIn November 2018, Amazon reached an agreement with Apple Inc. to sell selected products through the service, via the company and selected Apple Authorized Resellers. As a result of this partnership, only Apple Authorized Resellers may sell Apple products on Amazon effective January 4, 2019.[67][68]\nAmazon sells many products under its own brand names, including phone chargers, batteries, and diaper wipes. The AmazonBasics brand was introduced in 2009, and now features hundreds of product lines, including smartphone cases, computer mice, batteries, dumbbells, and dog crates. Amazon owned 34 private-label brands as of 2019. These brands account for 0.15% of Amazon's global sales, whereas the average for other large retailers is 18%.[69] Other Amazon retail brands include Presto!, Mama Bear, and Amazon Essentials.[70]\nAmazon derives many of its sales (around 40% in 2008) from third-party sellers who sell products on Amazon.[71] Some other large e-commerce sellers use Amazon to sell their products in addition to selling them through their websites. The sales are processed through Amazon.com and end up at individual sellers for processing and order fulfillment and Amazon leases space for these retailers. Small sellers of used and new goods go to Amazon Marketplace to offer goods at a fixed price.[72]\nPublishers can signup as affiliates and receive a commission for referring customers to Amazon by placing links to Amazon on their websites if the referral results in a sale. Worldwide, Amazon has \"over 900,000 members\" in its affiliate programs.[73] In the middle of 2014, the Amazon Affiliate Program is used by 1.2% of all websites and it is the second most popular advertising network after Google Ads.[74] It is frequently used by websites and non-profits to provide a way for supporters to earn them a commission.[75]\nAssociates can access the Amazon catalog directly on their websites by using the Amazon Web Services (AWS) XML service. A new affiliate product, aStore, allows Associates to embed a subset of Amazon products within another website, or linked to another website. In June 2010, Amazon Seller Product Suggestions was launched to provide more transparency to sellers by recommending specific products to third-party sellers to sell on Amazon. Products suggested are based on customers' browsing history.[76]\nAmazon allows users to submit reviews to the web page of each product. Reviewers must rate the product on a rating scale from one to five stars. Amazon provides a badging option for reviewers which indicates the real name of the reviewer (based on confirmation of a credit card account) or which indicates that the reviewer is one of the top reviewers by popularity. As of December 16, 2020, Amazon removed the ability of sellers and customers to comment on product reviews and purged their websites of all posted product review comments. In an email to sellers Amazon gave its rationale for removing this feature: \"... the comments feature on customer reviews was rarely used.\" The remaining review response options are to indicate whether the reader finds the review helpful or to report that it violates Amazon policies (abuse). If a review is given enough \"helpful\" hits, it appears on the front page of the product. In 2010, Amazon was reported as being the largest single source of Internet consumer reviews.[77]\nWhen publishers asked Bezos why Amazon would publish negative reviews, he defended the practice by claiming that Amazon.com was \"taking a different approach ... we want to make every book available\u2014the good, the bad and the ugly ... to let truth loose\".[78]\nThere have been cases of positive reviews being written and posted by public relations companies on behalf of their clients[79] and instances of writers using pseudonyms to leave negative reviews of their rivals' works\nThe Amazon sales rank (ASR) indicates the popularity of a product sold on any Amazon locale. It is a relative indicator of popularity that is updated hourly. Effectively, it is a \"best sellers list\" for the millions of products stocked by Amazon.[80] While the ASR has no direct effect on the sales of a product, it is used by Amazon to determine which products to include in its bestsellers lists.[80] Products that appear in these lists enjoy additional exposure on the Amazon website and this may lead to an increase in sales. In particular, products that experience large jumps (up or down) in their sales ranks may be included within Amazon's lists of \"movers and shakers\"; such a listing provides additional exposure that might lead to an increase in sales.[81] For competitive reasons, Amazon does not release actual sales figures to the public. However, Amazon has now begun to release point of sale data via the Nielsen BookScan service to verified authors.[82] While the ASR has been the source of much speculation by publishers, manufacturers, and marketers, Amazon itself does not release the details of its sales rank calculation algorithm. Some companies have analyzed Amazon sales data to generate sales estimates based on the ASR,[83] though Amazon states:\nPlease keep in mind that our sales rank figures are simply meant to be a guide of general interest for the customer and not definitive sales information for publishers\u2014we assume you have this information regularly from your distribution sources\nIn November 2015, Amazon opened a physical Amazon Books store in University Village in Seattle. The store is 5,500 square feet and prices for all products match those on its website.[85] Amazon opened its tenth physical book store in 2017;[86] media speculation suggests that Amazon plans to eventually roll out 300 to 400 bookstores around the country.[85]\nIn June 2018, it was reported that Amazon planned to open brick and mortar bookstores in Germany.[87]\nIn August 2019, Amazon applied to have a liquor store in San Francisco, CA as a means to ship beer and alcohol within the city.[88]\nIn 2020, Amazon Fresh opened several physical stores in the U.S. and the United Kingdom.[89]\nAmazon has a number of products and services available, including its digital assistant Alexa, Amazon Music and Prime Video for music and videos respectively, the Amazon Appstore for Android apps, and its Kindle hardware line of e-readers and tablets. Audible provides audiobooks for purchase and listening.\nIn September 2021, Amazon announced the launch of Astro, its first household robot, powered by its Alexa smart home technology. This can be remote-controlled when not at home, to check on pets, people, or home security. It will send owners a notification if it detects something unusual.[90]\nIn January 2023, Amazon announced the launch of RXPass, a prescription drug delivery service. It allows US Amazon Prime members to pay a $5 monthly fee for access to 60 medications. The service was launched immediately after the announcement except in states with specific prescription delivery requirements. Beneficiaries of government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid will not be able to sign up for RXPass.[91]\nAmazon owns over 40 subsidiaries, including Amazon Web Services, Audible, Diapers.com, Goodreads, IMDb, Kiva Systems (now Amazon Robotics), Shopbop, Teachstreet, Twitch, Zappos, and Zoox.[92]\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is a subsidiary of that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. These cloud computing web services provide distributed computing processing capacity and software tools via AWS server farms. As of 2021 Q4, AWS has 33% market share for cloud infrastructure while the next two competitors Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud have 21%, and 10% respectively, according to Synergy Group.[93][94]\nAudible is a seller and producer of spoken audio entertainment, information, and educational programming on the Internet. Audible sells digital audiobooks, radio and television programs, and audio versions of magazines and newspapers. Through its production arm, Audible Studios, Audible has also become the world's largest producer of downloadable audiobooks. On January 31, 2008, Amazon announced it would buy Audible for about $300\u00a0million. The deal closed in March 2008 and Audible became a subsidiary of Amazon.[95]\nGoodreads is a \"social cataloging\" website founded in December 2006 and launched in January 2007 by Otis Chandler, a software engineer, and entrepreneur, and Elizabeth Khuri. The website allows individuals to freely search Goodreads' extensive user-populated database of books, annotations, and reviews. Users can sign up and register books to generate library catalogs and reading lists. They can also create their groups of book suggestions and discussions. In December 2007, the site had over 650,000 members, and over a million books had been added. Amazon bought the company in March 2013.[96]\nRing is a home automation company founded by Jamie Siminoff in 2013. It is primarily known for its WiFi powered smart doorbells, but manufactures other devices such as security cameras. Amazon bought Ring for US$1\u00a0billion in 2018.[97]\nTwitch is a live streaming platform for video, primarily oriented towards video gaming content. Twitch was acquired by Amazon in August 2014 for $970\u00a0million.[98] The site's rapid growth had been boosted primarily by the prominence of major esports competitions on the service, leading GameSpot senior esports editor Rod Breslau to have described the service as \"the ESPN of esports\".[99] As of 2015[update], the service had over 1.5\u00a0million broadcasters and 100\u00a0million monthly viewers.[100]\nWhole Foods Market is an American supermarket chain exclusively featuring foods without artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, sweeteners, and hydrogenated fats.[101] Amazon acquired Whole Foods for $13.7 billion in August 2017.[102][103][9]\nOther Amazon subsidiaries include:\nAmazon also has investments in renewable energy and plans to expand its position into the Canadian market through an investment in a new plant in Alberta.[135]\nAmazon uses many different transportation services to deliver packages. Amazon-branded services include:\nAmazon directly employs people to work at its warehouses, bulk distribution centers, staffed \"Amazon Hub Locker+\" locations, and delivery stations where drivers pick up packages. As of December 2020, it is not hiring delivery drivers as employees.[138]\nRakuten Intelligence estimated that in 2020 in the United States, the proportion of last-mile deliveries was 56% by Amazon's directly contracted services (mostly in urban areas), 30% by the U.S. Postal Service (mostly in rural areas), and 14% by UPS.[139] In April 2021, Amazon reported to investors it had increased its in-house delivery capacity by 50% in the last 12 months (which included the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States).[140]\nAmazon first launched its distribution network in 1997 with two fulfillment centers in Seattle and New Castle, Delaware. Amazon has several types of distribution facilities consisting of cross-dock centers, fulfillment centers, sortation centers, delivery stations, Prime now hubs, and Prime air hubs. There are 75 fulfillment centers and 25 sortation centers with over 125,000 employees.[141][142] Employees are responsible for five basic tasks: unpacking and inspecting incoming goods; placing goods in storage and recording their location; picking goods from their computer recorded locations to make up an individual shipment; sorting and packing orders; and shipping. A computer that records the location of goods and maps out routes for pickers plays a key role: employees carry hand-held computers which communicate with the central computer and monitor their rate of progress. Some warehouses are partially automated with systems built by Amazon Robotics.[citation needed]\nIn September 2006, Amazon launched a program called FBA (Fulfillment By Amazon) whereby it could handle storage, packing and distribution of products and services for small sellers.[citation needed]\nAmazon.fr fulfillment center in Lauwin-Planque, France\nAmazon.es fulfillment center in San Fernando de Henares, Spain\nAmazon.co.uk fulfillment center in Glenrothes, Scotland, UK\nAmazon.de fulfillment center in Graben, Germany\nAmazon.co.jp fulfillment center in Ichikawa, Japan\nAmazon fulfillment center in Macon, Georgia, U.S.\nAs of June\u00a02022[update], Amazon's board of directors were:[143]\nAmazon.com is primarily a retail site with a sales revenue model; Amazon takes a small percentage of the sale price of each item that is sold through its website while also allowing companies to advertise their products by paying to be listed as featured products.[144] As of 2018[update], Amazon.com is ranked eighth on the Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.[145]\nFor the fiscal year 2021, Amazon reported earnings of US$33.36\u00a0billion, with an annual revenue of US$469.82\u00a0billion, an increase of 21.7% over the previous fiscal cycle. Since 2007 sales increased from 14.835\u00a0billion to 469.822\u00a0billion, due to continued business expansion.[146]\nAmazon's market capitalization went over US$1\u00a0trillion again in early February 2020 after the announcement of the fourth quarter 2019 results.[147]\nDuring his tenure, Jeff Bezos had become renowned for his annual shareholder letters, which have gained similar notability to those of Warren Buffett.[165] These annual letters gave an \"invaluable window\" into the famously \"secretive\" company, and revealed Bezos's perspectives and strategic focus.[165][166] A common theme of these letters is Bezos's desire to instill customer-centricity (in his words, \"customer obsession\") at all levels of Amazon, notably by making all senior executives field customer support queries for a short time at Amazon call centers. He also read many emails addressed by customers to his public email address.[167] One of Bezos's most well-known internal memos was his mandate for \"all teams\" to \"expose their data and functionality\" through service interfaces \"designed from the ground up to be externalizable\". This process, commonly known as a service-oriented architecture (SOA), resulted in mandatory dogfooding of services that would later be commercialized as part of AWS.[citation needed]\nAmazon lobbies the United States federal government and state governments on multiple issues such as the enforcement of sales taxes on online sales, transportation safety, privacy and data protection and intellectual property. According to regulatory filings, Amazon.com focuses its lobbying on the United States Congress, the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Reserve. Amazon.com spent roughly $3.5\u00a0million, $5\u00a0million and $9.5\u00a0million on lobbying, in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively.[168] In 2019, it spent $16.8\u00a0million and had a team of 104 lobbyists.[169]\nAmazon.com was a corporate member of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) until it dropped membership following protests at its shareholders' meeting on May 24, 2012.[170]\nIn 2014, Amazon expanded its lobbying practices as it prepared to lobby the Federal Aviation Administration to approve its drone delivery program, hiring the Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld lobbying firm in June.[171] Amazon and its lobbyists have visited with Federal Aviation Administration officials and aviation committees in Washington, D.C. to explain its plans to deliver packages.[172] In September 2020 this moved one step closer with the granting of a critical certificate by the FAA.[173]\nAmazon has attracted criticism for its actions, including: supplying law enforcement with facial recognition surveillance tools;[174] forming cloud computing partnerships with the CIA;[175] leading customers away from bookshops;[176] adversely impacting the environment;[177] placing a low priority on warehouse conditions for workers;[178] actively opposing unionization efforts;[179] remotely deleting content purchased by Amazon Kindle users; taking public subsidies; seeking to patent its 1-Click technology; engaging in anti-competitive actions and price discrimination;[23][24] and reclassifying LGBT books as adult content.[180][181] Criticism has also concerned various decisions over whether to censor or publish content such as the WikiLeaks website, works containing libel and material facilitating dogfight, cockfight, or pedophile activities. In December 2011, Amazon faced a backlash from small businesses for running a one-day deal to promote its new Price Check app. Shoppers who used the app to check prices in a brick-and-mortar store were offered a 5% discount to purchase the same item from Amazon.[182] Companies like Groupon, eBay and Taap.it countered Amazon's promotion by offering $10 off from their products.[183][184]\nThe company has also faced accusations of putting undue pressure on suppliers to maintain and extend its profitability. One effort to squeeze the most vulnerable book publishers was known within the company as the Gazelle Project, after Bezos suggested, according to Brad Stone, \"that Amazon should approach these small publishers the way a cheetah would pursue a sickly gazelle.\"[50] In July 2014, the Federal Trade Commission launched a lawsuit against the company alleging it was promoting in-app purchases to children, which were being transacted without parental consent.[185] In 2019, Amazon banned selling skin-lightening and racist products that might affect the consumer's health.[186] In 2022, a lawsuit filed by state attorney-general Letitia James was dismissed by the New York state court of appeals.[187]", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "

Wikipedia": {"text": "The Ayala Museum is a museum in Makati, Metro Manila, Philippines. It is run privately by the Ayala Foundation and houses archaeological, ethnographic, historical, fine arts, numismatics, and ecclesiastical exhibits.[2] Since its establishment in 1967,[3] the museum has been committed to showcasing overseas collections and situating contemporary Philippine art in the global arena in a two-way highway of mutual cooperation and exchange with local and international associates.[4] The museum was reopened on December 4, 2021, after a two-year renovation.[5]\nEnvisioned during the 1950s by Philippine abstract painter Fernando Z\u00f3bel de Ayala y Montojo, as a museum of Philippine history and iconography, the Ayala Museum was established in 1967 as a project of the Filipinas Foundation, now known as the Ayala Foundation.[3] The museum was housed at the Insular Life Building and was transferred to[6] the old Makati Stock Exchange Building.[7] The old building was designed by National Artist Leandro Locsin.[6]\nPlans to transfer to the Ayala Museum were made as early as 2002.[8] The old building that hosted the old Ayala Museum was demolished which met some criticism from heritage conservationists.[6]\nThe museum moved to a new six-story building made from granite, steel and glass,[6] which was designed by Leandro V. Locsin Partners, led by Leandro Y. Locsin, Jr. It was formally dedicated at the 170th anniversary of the Ayala Corporation on September 28, 2004.[3]\nThe museum temporarily closed on June 1, 2019, for renovations, which were expected to finish by the end of 2020.[9] These renovations were halted due to the COVID\u201319 pandemic, but subsequently finished by November 2021. The museum reopened on December 4, 2021.[10][11]\nContemporary exhibitions such as retrospectives of Filipino artists and contemporary international art are housed at the ground floor of the museum.\nRecent exhibition features the \"Beyond Tobacco\" exhibit which is in time with Ayala Corporation's 180th anniversary. Beyond Tobacco presents the rich economic history of the Philippines and its deep relationship with Spain during and after the Tobacco Monopoly in the 19th century by its large collection of artifacts, memorabilia, maps, and photographs of the Compa\u00f1ia General de Tobacos de Filipinas (also known as Tabacalera). Artifacts such as tobaccos, cigar holders, and other paraphernalia are shown in the exhibit. Maps of huge tobacco plantations chiefly in Luzon are also displayed, including photos of the factory before and after being bombed during the Japanese occupation. Furthermore, paintings by Fernando Amorsolo and books written by Jaime Gil de Biedma and other biographers are on display.[16] The exhibit was curated by Professor Martin Rodrigo of the Universitat Pompeu Fabra (also known as Pompeu Fabra University) in Barcelona, Spain.[17]\nThe museum's third floor galleries and the Zobel multipurpose hall are designed to house the changing displays showing Pioneers of Philippine Art, Images of Nation, New Frontiers, and Collector Series- from the 18th century to the contemporary period of Philippine art.[18]\nPioneers of Philippine Art showcases the 100 years of Philippine art from the late 19th century to the 20th century in the works of three famous Filipino artists namely Juan Luna, Fernando Amorsolo and Fernando Zobel.[18] Paintings of Amorsolo includes Palay Maiden (1920), Maiden with Lanzones (1924), Maiden in a Flower Garden (1948),  Portrait of Victoria Zobel de Ayala (1948), and Open Market Scene (1957-1958) to name a few. All works of Zobel highlights pure non-objectivism and abstract art. Some of these include Vasata (1960), Portrait of Ep (1961), El Balcon II (1964), Pausa Clara (1966), and Las Soledades de Lope de Vega (1968).\nImages of Nation shows the works of the national artists for visual arts of the Philippines while, New Frontiers features the work of contemporary artists. Launched in 2010. In the past years, Images of Nation has featured a collection of works by Vicente Manansala (May\u2013July 2010), Jose Joya (September 2011-January 2012), and Victorio Edades (March- July 2012).[19]\nThe Collector Series presents selections from private collections of art in curated thematic exhibitions.[18]\nThe Filipinas Heritage Library is located on the sixth floor of the museum. It is known to be one of the electronic research centers in the Philippines. It houses more than 13,000 contemporary volumes on Philippine history, art, language, religion, and the social sciences, and more than 2,000 uncommon titles, maps, and photographs. Additional features of this library include the digitization of its collection, CD-ROM publishing, development of web pages, and electronic databases.[21]  The library has set up an online search engine that provides access to more than 357,000 Filipiniana database records, through its numerous Library Link initiatives in the past, from over a hundred partner libraries across the Philippines.[22]\nAside from the pieces of tradeware vessels from the Roberto T. Villanueva collection, one section of the museum provides researchers with study collections including books and several publications on art and history of ceramics courtesy of John D. Forbes.[23]\n14\u00b033\u203212.98\u2033N 121\u00b01\u203223.41\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff14.5536056\u00b0N 121.0231694\u00b0E\ufeff / 14.5536056; 121.0231694\ufeff (Ayala Museum)Coordinates:
