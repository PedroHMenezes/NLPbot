{"Atacama Desert - Wikipedia": {"text": "The Atacama Desert (Spanish: Desierto de Atacama) is a desert plateau in South America covering a 1,600\u00a0km (990\u00a0mi) strip of land on the Pacific coast, west of the Andes Mountains. The Atacama Desert is the driest nonpolar desert in the world, and the second driest overall, just behind some very specific spots within the McMurdo Dry Valleys[2][3][4][5] as well as the only hot true desert to receive less precipitation than the polar deserts, and the largest fog desert in the world. Both[clarification needed] regions have been used as experimentation sites on Earth for Mars expedition simulations. The Atacama Desert occupies 105,000\u00a0km2 (41,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi),[6] or 128,000\u00a0km2 (49,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) if the barren lower slopes of the Andes are included.[7] Most of the desert is composed of stony terrain, salt lakes (salares), sand, and felsic lava that flows towards the Andes.[clarification needed]\nThe desert owes its extreme aridity to a constant temperature inversion due to the cool north-flowing Humboldt ocean current and to the presence of the strong Pacific anticyclone.[8] The most arid region of the Atacama Desert is situated between two mountain chains (the Andes and the Chilean Coast Range) of sufficient height to prevent moisture advection from either the Pacific or the Atlantic Ocean, a two-sided rain shadow.[9]\nAccording to the World Wide Fund for Nature, the Atacama Desert ecoregion occupies a continuous strip for nearly 1,600\u00a0km (1,000\u00a0mi) along the narrow coast of the northern third of Chile, from near Arica (18\u00b024\u2032S) southward to near La Serena (29\u00b055\u2032S).[10] The National Geographic Society considers the coastal area of southern Peru to be part of the Atacama Desert[11][12] and includes the deserts south of the Ica Region in Peru. However, other sources consider that the part of the desert in Peru is a different ecosystem, and should properly be named as Pampas de la Joya desert.\nPeru borders it on the north and the Chilean Matorral ecoregion borders it on the south. To the east lies the less arid Central Andean dry puna ecoregion. The drier portion of this ecoregion is located south of the Loa River between the parallel Sierra Vicu\u00f1a Mackenna and Cordillera Domeyko. To the north of the Loa lies the Pampa del Tamarugal.\nThe Coastal Cliff of northern Chile west of the Chilean Coast Range is the main topographical feature of the coast.[13] The geomorphology of the Atacama Desert has been characterized as a low-relief bench \"similar to a giant uplifted terrace\" by Armijo and co-workers.[14] The intermediate depression (or Central Valley) forms a series of endorheic basins in much of the Atacama Desert south of latitude 19\u00b030'S. North of this latitude, the intermediate depression drains into the Pacific Ocean.[15]\nThe almost total lack of precipitation is the most prominent characteristic of the Atacama Desert.[17]\nIn 2012, the altiplano winter brought floods to San Pedro de Atacama.[18][19]\nOn 25 March 2015, heavy rainfall affected the southern part of the Atacama Desert.[20][21] Resulting floods triggered mudflows that affected the cities of Copiapo, Tierra Amarilla, Chanaral, and Diego de Almagro, causing the deaths of more than 100 people.\nThe Atacama Desert is commonly known as the driest place in the world, especially the surroundings of the abandoned Yungay mining town, where the University of Antofagasta Desert Research Station is located,[22][23] in Antofagasta Region, Chile.[24] The average rainfall is about 15\u00a0mm (0.6\u00a0in) per year,[25] although some locations receive 1 to 3\u00a0mm (0.04 to 0.12\u00a0in) in a year.[26] Moreover, some weather stations in the Atacama have never received rain. Periods up to four years have been registered with no rainfall in the central sector, delimited by the cities of Antofagasta, Calama, and Copiap\u00f3, in Chile.[27] Evidence suggests that the Atacama may not have had any significant rainfall from 1570 to 1971.[6]\nThe Atacama Desert may be the oldest desert on earth, and has experienced hyperaridity since at least the Middle Miocene, since the establishment of a proto-Humboldt current in conjunction with the opening of the Tasmania-Antarctic passage ca. 33 Ma.[28] The opening of the Tasmania-Antarctic passage allowed for cold currents to move along the west coast of South America, which influenced the availability of warm humid air to travel from the Amazon Basin to the Atacama. Though there was a general lack of humid air after 33 Ma, there were punctuated intervals of increased humidity,[29] such as between around 10.86 and 6.4 Ma, when the Tiliviche Palaeolake existed before turning into a salar sometime before the Middle Pliocene.[30] The long history of aridity raises the possibility that supergene mineralisation, under the appropriate conditions, can form in arid environments, instead of requiring humid conditions.[31] The presence of evaporite formations suggest that in some sections of the Atacama Desert, arid conditions have persisted for the last 200 million years (since the Triassic).\nThe Atacama is so arid that many mountains higher than 6,000\u00a0m (20,000\u00a0ft) are completely free of glaciers. Only the highest peaks (such as Ojos del Salado, Monte Pissis, and Llullaillaco) have some permanent snow coverage.\nThe southern part of the desert, between 25\u00b0 and 27\u00b0S, may have been glacier-free throughout the Quaternary (including during glaciations), though permafrost extends down to an altitude of 4,400\u00a0m (14,400\u00a0ft) and is continuous above 5,600\u00a0m (18,400\u00a0ft). Studies by a group of British scientists have suggested that some river beds have been dry for 120,000 years.[32] However, some locations in the Atacama receive a marine fog known locally as the camanchaca, providing sufficient moisture for hypolithic algae, lichens, and even some cacti\u2014the genus Copiapoa is notable among these.\nGeographically, the aridity of the Atacama is explained by its being situated between two mountain chains (the Andes and the Chilean Coast Range) of sufficient height to prevent moisture advection from either the Pacific or the Atlantic Oceans, a two-sided rain shadow.[9]\nDespite modern views of the Atacama Desert as fully devoid of vegetation, in pre-Columbian and colonial times a large flatland area there known as Pampa del Tamarugal was a woodland, but demand for firewood associated with silver and saltpeter mining in the 18th and 19th centuries resulted in widespread deforestation.[33][A]\nIn a region about 100\u00a0km (60\u00a0mi) south of Antofagasta, which averages 3,000\u00a0m (10,000\u00a0ft) in elevation, the soil has been compared to that of Mars. Owing to its otherworldly appearance, the Atacama has been used as a location for filming Mars scenes, most notably in the television series Space Odyssey: Voyage to the Planets.\nIn 2003, a team of researchers published a report  in which they duplicated the tests used by the Viking 1 and Viking 2 Mars landers to detect life and were unable to detect any signs in Atacama Desert soil in the region of Yungay.[23] The region may be unique on Earth in this regard and is being used by NASA to test instruments for future Mars missions. The team duplicated the Viking tests in Mars-like Earth environments and found that they missed present signs of life in soil samples from Antarctic dry valleys, the Atacama Desert of Chile and Peru, and other locales.\nHowever, in 2014, a new hyperarid site was reported, Mar\u00eda Elena South, which was much drier than Yungay and, thus, a better Mars-like environment.[35]\nTowards Atacama, near the deserted coast, you see a land without men, where there is not a bird, not a beast, nor a tree, nor any vegetation.\nLa Araucana by Alonso de Ercilla, 1569[36]\nIn 2008, the Phoenix Mars Lander detected perchlorates on the surface of Mars at the same site where water was first discovered.[37] Perchlorates are also found in the Atacama and associated nitrate deposits have contained organics, leading to speculation that signs of life on Mars are not incompatible with perchlorates. The Atacama is also a testing site for the NASA-funded Earth\u2013Mars Cave Detection Program.[38]\nOn 21 February 2023, scientists reported the findings of a \"dark microbiome\" of unfamiliar microorganisms in the Atacama Desert.[39][40]\nIn June 1991, Antofagasta and Taltal and inland regions as far as Calama received unusual rainfall leading to formation of a series of mudflows that killed 91 persons.[41][42][43]\nIn spite of the geographic and climatic conditions of the desert, a rich variety of flora has evolved there. Over 500 species have been gathered within the border of this desert. These species are characterized by their extraordinary ability to adapt to this extreme environment.[44] The most common species are herbs and flowers such as thyme, llareta, and saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), and where humidity is sufficient, trees such as the cha\u00f1ar (Geoffroea decorticans), the pimiento tree, and the leafy algarrobo (Prosopis chilensis).\nThe llareta is one of the highest-growing wood species in the world. It is found at altitudes between 3,000 and 5,000\u00a0m (9,800 and 16,400\u00a0ft). Its dense form is similar to a pillow some 3 to 4\u00a0m (9.8 to 13.1\u00a0ft) thick. It concentrates and retains the heat from the day to cope with low evening temperatures. The growth rate of the llareta has been recently estimated at about 1.5\u00a0cm/year (0.59\u00a0in/year), making many llaretas over 3,000 years old. It produces a much-prized resin, which the mining industry once harvested indiscriminately as fuel, making this plant endangered.\nThe desert is also home to cacti, succulents, and other plants that thrive in a dry climate. Cactus species here include the candelabro (Browningia candelaris) and cardon (Echinopsis atacamensis), which can reach a height of 7\u00a0m (23\u00a0ft) and a diameter of 70\u00a0cm (28\u00a0in).\nThe Atacama Desert flowering (Spanish: desierto florido) can be seen from September to November in years with sufficient precipitation, as happened in 2015.[20][21]\nThe climate of the Atacama Desert limits the number of animals living permanently in this extreme ecosystem. Some parts of the desert are so arid, no plant or animal life can survive. Outside of these extreme areas, sand-colored grasshoppers blend with pebbles on the desert floor, and beetles and their larvae provide a valuable food source in the lomas (hills). Desert wasps and butterflies can be found during the warm and humid season, especially on the lomas. Red scorpions also live in the desert.\nA unique environment is provided by some lomas, where the fog from the ocean provides enough moisture for seasonal plants and a few animal species. Surprisingly few reptile species inhabit the desert and even fewer amphibian species. Chaunus atacamensis, the Vallenar toad or Atacama toad, lives on the lomas, where it lays eggs in permanent ponds or streams. Iguanians and lava lizards inhabit parts of the desert, while salt flat lizards, Liolaemus, live in the dry areas bordering the ocean.[45] One species, Liolaemus fabiani, is endemic to the Salar de Atacama, the Atacama salt flat.[46]\nBirds are one of the most diverse animal groups in the Atacama. Humboldt penguins live year-round along the coast, nesting in desert cliffs overlooking the ocean. Inland, high-altitude salt flats are inhabited by Andean flamingos, while Chilean flamingos can be seen along the coast. Other birds (including species of hummingbirds and rufous-collared sparrow) visit the lomas seasonally to feed on insects, nectar, seeds, and flowers. The lomas help sustain several threatened species, such as the endangered Chilean woodstar.\nBecause of the desert's extreme aridity, only a few specially adapted mammal species live in the Atacama, such as Darwin's leaf-eared mouse. The less arid parts of the desert are inhabited by the South American gray fox and the viscacha (a relative of the chinchilla). Larger animals, such as guanacos and vicu\u00f1as, graze in areas where grass grows, mainly because it is seasonally irrigated by melted snow. Vicu\u00f1as need to remain near a steady water supply, while guanacos can roam into more arid areas and survive longer without fresh water. South American fur seals and South American sea lions often gather along the coast.\nThe Atacama is sparsely populated, with most towns located along the Pacific coast.[47] In interior areas, oases and some valleys have been populated for millennia and were the location of the most advanced pre-Columbian societies found in Chile.[citation needed]\nThe Chinchorro culture developed in the Atacama Desert area from 7000 BCE to 1500 BCE. These peoples were sedentary fishermen inhabiting mostly coastal areas. Their presence is found from today's towns of Ilo, in southern Peru, to Antofagasta in northern Chile. Presence of fresh water in the arid region on the coast facilitated human settlement in these areas. The Chinchorro were famous for their detailed mummification and funerary practices.[48]\nSan Pedro de Atacama, at about 2,400\u00a0m (8,000\u00a0ft) elevation, is like many of the small towns. Before the Inca Empire and prior to the arrival of the Spanish, the extremely arid interior was inhabited primarily by the Atacame\u00f1o tribe. They are noted for building fortified towns called pucar\u00e1s, one of which is located a few kilometers from San Pedro de Atacama. The town's church was built by the Spanish in 1577.\nThe oasis settlement of Pica has Pre-hispanic origins and served as an important stopover for transit between the coast and the Altiplano during the time of the Inca Empire.[49]\nThe coastal cities originated in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries during the time of the Spanish Empire, when they emerged as shipping ports for silver produced in Potos\u00ed and other mining centers.\nDuring the 19th century, the desert came under control of Bolivia, Chile, and Peru. With the discovery of sodium nitrate deposits and as a result of unclear borders, the area soon became a zone of conflict and resulted in the War of the Pacific. Chile annexed most of the desert, and cities along the coast developed into international ports, hosting many Chilean workers who migrated there.[50][51][52]\nWith the guano and saltpeter booms of the 19th century, the population grew immensely, mostly as a result of immigration from central Chile. In the 20th century, the nitrate industry declined and at the same time, the largely male population of the desert became increasingly problematic for the Chilean state. Miners and mining companies came into conflict, and protests spread throughout the region.\nAround 1900, there were  irrigation system of puquios spread through the oases of Atacama Desert.[53] Puquios are known from the valleys of Azapa and Sibaya and the oases of La Calera, Pica-Matilla and Puquio de N\u00fa\u00f1ez.[53] In 1918, geologist Juan Br\u00fcggen mentioned the existence of 23 socavones (shafts) in the Pica oasis, yet these have since been abandoned due to economic and social changes.[53]\nThe desert has rich deposits of copper and other minerals and the world's largest natural supply of sodium nitrate (Chile saltpeter), which was mined on a large scale until the early 1940s. The Atacama border dispute over these resources between Chile and Bolivia began in the 19th century and resulted in the War of the Pacific.[54]\nThe desert is littered with about 170 abandoned nitrate (or \"saltpeter\") mining towns, almost all of which were shut down decades after the invention of synthetic nitrate in Germany in the first decade of the 20th century (see Haber process).[citation needed] The towns include Chacabuco, Humberstone, Santa Laura, Pedro de Valdivia, Puelma, Mar\u00eda Elena, and Oficina Anita.[citation needed]\nThe Atacama Desert is rich in metallic mineral resources such as copper, gold, silver and iron, as well as nonmetallic minerals including important deposits of boron, lithium, sodium nitrate, and potassium salts. The Salar de Atacama is where bischofite is extracted.[citation needed] These resources are exploited by various mining companies such as Codelco, Lomas Bayas, Mantos Blancos, and Soquimich.[55][56]\nBecause of its high altitude, nearly nonexistent cloud cover, dry air, and freedom from light pollution and radio interference from widely populated cities and towns, this desert is one of the best places in the world to conduct astronomical observations.[58][59] Hundreds of thousands of stars can be viewed via telescope since the desert experiences more than 200 cloudless nights each year. A number of telescopes have been installed to help astronomers from across the globe study the universe.[60] A radio astronomy telescope, called the Atacama Large Millimeter Array, built by European countries, Japan, the United States, Canada, and Chile in the Llano de Chajnantor Observatory officially opened on 3 October 2011.[61] A number of radio astronomy projects, such as the CBI, the ASTE and the ACT, among others, have been operating in the Chajnantor area since 1999. On 26 April 2010, the ESO council decided to build a fourth site, Cerro Armazones, to be home to the Extremely Large Telescope.[62][63][64] Construction work at the ELT site started in June 2014.[65]\nThe European Southern Observatory operates three major observatories in the Atacama and is currently building a fourth:\nThe Atacama Desert is popular with all-terrain sports enthusiasts. Various championships have taken place here, including the Lower Atacama Rally, Lower Chile Rally, Patagonia-Atacama Rally, and the latter Dakar Rally's editions. The rally was organized by the Amaury Sport Organisation and held in 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012. The dunes of the desert are ideal rally races located in the outskirts of the city of Copiap\u00f3.[66] The 2013 Dakar 15-Day Rally started on 5 January in Lima, Peru, through Chile, Argentina and back to Chile finishing in Santiago.[67] Visitors also use the Atacama Desert sand dunes for sandboarding (Spanish: duna).\nA week-long foot race called the Atacama Crossing has the competitors cross the various landscapes of the Atacama.[68]\nAn event called Volcano Marathon takes place near the Lascar volcano in the Atacama Desert.[69]\nEighteen solar powered cars were displayed in front of the presidential palace (La Moneda) in Santiago in November 2012.[70] The cars were then raced 1,300\u00a0km (810\u00a0mi) through the desert from 15\u201319 November 2012.[71]\nMost people who go to tour the sites in the desert stay in the town of San Pedro de Atacama.[72] The Atacama Desert is in the top three tourist locations in Chile. The specially commissioned ESO hotel is reserved for astronomers and scientists.[73]\nAbout 80 geysers occur in a valley about 80\u00a0km from the town of San Pedro de Atacama. They are closer to the town of Chiu Chiu.[74]\nThe Ba\u00f1os de Puritama are rock pools which are 60 kilometres (37 miles) from the geysers.[75]\nIcy Penitentes by moonlight\nTara Cathedrals (left)

{"text": "Coordinates: 34\u00b0S 71\u00b0W\ufeff / \ufeff34\u00b0S 71\u00b0W\ufeff / -34; -71\nChile,[a] officially the Republic of Chile,[b] is a country located in western South America. It is the southernmost country in the world and closest to Antarctica, stretching along a narrow strip of land between the Andes Mountains and the Pacific Ocean. With an area of 756,096 square kilometers (291,930\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and a population of 17.5 million as of 2017,[5] Chile shares borders with Peru to the north, Bolivia to the northeast, Argentina to the east, and the Drake Passage to the south. The country also controls several Pacific islands, including Juan Fern\u00e1ndez, Isla Salas y G\u00f3mez, Desventuradas, and Easter Island, and claims about 1,250,000 square kilometers (480,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of Antarctica as the Chilean Antarctic Territory.[nb 2] The capital and largest city of Chile is Santiago, and the national language is Spanish.\nSpain conquered and colonized the region in the mid-16th century, replacing Inca rule, but failed to conquer the independent Mapuche people who inhabited what is now south-central Chile. In 1818, after declaring independence from Spain, Chile emerged as a relatively stable authoritarian republic in the 1830s. During the 19th century, Chile experienced significant economic and territorial growth, putting an end to Mapuche resistance in the 1880s and gaining its current northern territory in the War of the Pacific (1879\u201383) by defeating Peru and Bolivia. In the 20th century, up until the 1970s, Chile underwent a process of democratization[10][11] and experienced rapid population growth and urbanization,[12] while relying increasingly on exports from copper mining to support its economy.[13][14] During the 1960s and 1970s, the country was marked by severe left-right political polarization and turmoil, which culminated in the 1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat that overthrew Salvador Allende's democratically elected left-wing government. This was followed by a 16-year right-wing military dictatorship under Augusto Pinochet, which resulted in more than 3,000 deaths or disappearances.[15] The regime ended in 1990, following a referendum in 1988, and was succeeded by a center-left coalition, which ruled until 2010.\nChile has a high-income economy and one of the most economically and socially stable nations in South America, and leads Latin America in competitiveness, per capita income, globalization, peace, and economic freedom.[16] Chile also performs well in the region in terms of sustainability of the state and democratic development,[17] and boasts the second lowest homicide rate in the Americas, following only Canada. Chile is a founding member of the United Nations, the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), and the Pacific Alliance, and joined the OECD in 2010.\nThere are various theories about the origin of the word Chile. According to 17th-century Spanish chronicler Diego de Rosales,[18] the Incas called the valley of the Aconcagua Chili by corruption of the name of a Picunche tribal chief (cacique) called Tili, who ruled the area at the time of the Incan conquest in the 15th century.[19][20] Another theory points to the similarity of the valley of the Aconcagua with that of the Casma Valley in Peru, where there was a town and valley named Chili.[20]\nOther theories say Chile may derive its name from a Native American word meaning either 'ends of the earth' or 'sea gulls';[21] from the Mapuche word chilli, which may mean 'where the land ends'\"[22] or from the Quechua chiri, 'cold',[23] or tchili, meaning either 'snow'[23][24] or \"the deepest point of the Earth\".[25] Another origin attributed to chilli is the onomatopoeic cheele-cheele\u2014the Mapuche imitation of the warble of a bird locally known as trile.[22][26]\nThe Spanish conquistadors heard about this name from the Incas, and the few survivors of Diego de Almagro's first Spanish expedition south from Peru in 1535\u201336 called themselves the \"men of Chilli\".[22] Ultimately, Almagro is credited with the universalization of the name Chile, after naming the Mapocho valley as such.[20] The older spelling \"Chili\" was in use in English until the early 20th century before switching to \"Chile.\"[27]\nStone tool evidence indicates humans sporadically frequented the Monte Verde valley area as long as 18,500 years ago. About 10,000 years ago, migrating Indigenous Peoples settled in fertile valleys and coastal areas of what is present-day Chile. Settlement sites from very early human habitation include Monte Verde, Cueva del Milod\u00f3n and the Pali-Aike Crater's lava tube.[28]\nThe Incas briefly extended their empire into what is now northern Chile, but the Mapuche (or Araucanians as they were known by the Spaniards) successfully resisted many attempts by the Inca Empire to subjugate them, despite their lack of state organization.[29] They fought against the Sapa Inca Tupac Yupanqui and his army. The result of the bloody three-day confrontation known as the Battle of the Maule was that the Inca conquest of the territories of Chile ended at the Maule river.[30]\nIn 1520, while attempting to circumnavigate the globe, Ferdinand Magellan discovered the southern passage now named after him (the Strait of Magellan) thus becoming the first European to set foot on what is now Chile. The next Europeans to reach Chile were Diego de Almagro and his band of Spanish conquistadors, who came from Peru in 1535 seeking gold. The Spanish encountered various cultures that supported themselves principally through slash-and-burn agriculture and hunting.[30]\nThe conquest of Chile began in earnest in 1540 and was carried out by Pedro de Valdivia, one of Francisco Pizarro's lieutenants, who founded the city of Santiago on 12 February 1541. Although the Spanish did not find the extensive gold and silver they sought, they recognized the agricultural potential of Chile's central valley, and Chile became part of the Spanish Empire.[30]\nConquest took place gradually, and the Europeans suffered repeated setbacks. A massive Mapuche insurrection that began in 1553 resulted in Valdivia's death and the destruction of many of the colony's principal settlements. Subsequent major insurrections took place in 1598 and in 1655. Each time the Mapuche and other native groups revolted, the southern border of the colony was driven northward. The abolition of slavery by the Spanish crown in 1683 was done in recognition that enslaving the Mapuche intensified resistance rather than cowing them into submission. Despite royal prohibitions, relations remained strained from continual colonialist interference.[35]\nCut off to the north by desert, to the south by the Mapuche, to the east by the Andes Mountains, and to the west by the ocean, Chile became one of the most centralized, homogeneous colonies in Spanish America. Serving as a sort of frontier garrison, the colony found itself with the mission of forestalling encroachment by both the Mapuche and Spain's European enemies, especially the English and the Dutch. Buccaneers and pirates menaced the colony in addition to the Mapuche, as was shown by Sir Francis Drake's 1578 raid on Valpara\u00edso, the colony's principal port. Chile hosted one of the largest standing armies in the Americas, making it one of the most militarized of the Spanish possessions, as well as a drain on the treasury of the Viceroyalty of Peru.[22]\nThe first general census was conducted by the government of Agust\u00edn de J\u00e1uregui between 1777 and 1778; it indicated that the population consisted of 259,646 inhabitants: 73.5% of European descent, 7.9% mestizos, 8.6% indigenous peoples and 9.8% blacks. Francisco Hurtado, Governor of the province of Chilo\u00e9, conducted a census in 1784 and found the population consisted of 26,703 inhabitants, 64.4% of whom were whites and 33.5% of whom were natives. The Diocese of Concepci\u00f3n conducted a census in areas south of the Maule river in 1812, but did not include the indigenous population or the inhabitants of the province of Chilo\u00e9. The population is estimated at 210,567, 86.1% of whom were Spanish or of European descent, 10% of whom were indigenous and 3.7% of whom were mestizos, blacks and mulattos.[36]\nA 2021 study by Baten and Llorca-Ja\u00f1a shows that regions with a relatively high share of North European migrants developed faster in terms of numeracy, even if the overall number of migrants was small. This effect might be related to externalities: the surrounding population adopted a similar behavior as the small non-European immigrant group, and new schools were created. Ironically, there might have been positive spillover effects from the educational investment made by migrants, at the same time numeracy might have been reduced by the greater inequality in these regions. However, the positive effects of immigration were apparently stronger.[37]\nIn 1808, Napoleon's enthronement of his brother Joseph as the Spanish King precipitated the drive by the colony for independence from Spain. A national junta in the name of Ferdinand \u2013 heir to the deposed king \u2013 was formed on 18 September 1810. The Government Junta of Chile proclaimed Chile an autonomous republic within the Spanish monarchy (in memory of this day, Chile celebrates its National Day on 18 September each year).\nAfter these events, a movement for total independence, under the command of Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera (one of the most renowned patriots) and his two brothers Juan Jos\u00e9 and Luis Carrera, soon gained a wider following. Spanish attempts to re-impose arbitrary rule during what was called the Reconquista led to a prolonged struggle, including infighting from Bernardo O'Higgins, who challenged Carrera's leadership.\nIntermittent warfare continued until 1817. With Carrera in prison in Argentina, O'Higgins and anti-Carrera cohort Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn, hero of the Argentine War of Independence, led an army that crossed the Andes into Chile and defeated the royalists. On 12 February 1818, Chile was proclaimed an independent republic. The political revolt brought little social change, however, and 19th-century Chilean society preserved the essence of the stratified colonial social structure, which was greatly influenced by family politics and the Roman Catholic Church. A strong presidency eventually emerged, but wealthy landowners remained powerful.[30] Bernardo O'Higgins once planned to expand Chile by liberating the Philippines from Spain and incorporating the islands. In this regard he tasked the Scottish naval officer, Lord Thomas Cochrane, in a letter dated November 12, 1821, expressing his plan to conquer Guayaquil, the Galapagos Islands, and the Philippines. There were preparations, but the plan didn't push through because O' Higgins was exiled.[38]\nChile slowly started to expand its influence and to establish its borders. By the Tantauco Treaty, the archipelago of Chilo\u00e9 was incorporated in 1826. The economy began to boom due to the discovery of silver ore in Cha\u00f1arcillo, and the growing trade of the port of Valpara\u00edso, which led to conflict over maritime supremacy in the Pacific with Peru. At the same time, attempts were made to strengthen sovereignty in southern Chile intensifying penetration into Araucan\u00eda and colonizing Llanquihue with German immigrants in 1848. Through the founding of Fort Bulnes by the Schooner Ancud under the command of John Williams Wilson, the Magallanes region joined the country in 1843, while the Antofagasta region, at the time part of Bolivia, began to fill with people.\nToward the end of the 19th century, the government in Santiago consolidated its position in the south by the Occupation of Araucan\u00eda. The Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina confirmed Chilean sovereignty over the Strait of Magellan. As a result of the War of the Pacific with Peru and Bolivia (1879\u201383), Chile expanded its territory northward by almost one-third, eliminating Bolivia's access to the Pacific, and acquired valuable nitrate deposits, the exploitation of which led to an era of national affluence. Chile had joined the stand as one of the high-income countries in South America by 1870.[39]\nThe 1891 Chilean Civil War brought about a redistribution of power between the President and Congress, and Chile established a parliamentary style democracy. However, the Civil War had also been a contest between those who favored the development of local industries and powerful Chilean banking interests, particularly the House of Edwards which had strong ties to foreign investors. Soon after, the country engaged in a vastly expensive naval arms race with Argentina that nearly led to war.\nThe Chilean economy partially degenerated into a system protecting the interests of a ruling oligarchy. By the 1920s, the emerging middle and working classes were powerful enough to elect a reformist president, Arturo Alessandri, whose program was frustrated by a conservative congress. In the 1920s, Marxist groups with strong popular support arose.[30]\nA military coup led by General Luis Altamirano in 1924 set off a period of political instability that lasted until 1932. Of the ten governments that held power in that period, the longest lasting was that of General Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo, who briefly held power in 1925 and then again between 1927 and 1931 in what was a de facto dictatorship (although not really comparable in harshness or corruption to the type of military dictatorship that have often bedeviled the rest of Latin America).[40][41]\nBy relinquishing power to a democratically elected successor, Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo retained the respect of a large enough segment of the population to remain a viable politician for more than thirty years, in spite of the vague and shifting nature of his ideology. When constitutional rule was restored in 1932, a strong middle-class party, the Radicals, emerged. It became the key force in coalition governments for the next 20 years. During the period of Radical Party dominance (1932\u201352), the state increased its role in the economy. In 1952, voters returned Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo to office for another six years. Jorge Alessandri succeeded Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo in 1958, bringing Chilean conservatism back into power democratically for another term.\nThe 1964 presidential election of Christian Democrat Eduardo Frei Montalva by an absolute majority initiated a period of major reform. Under the slogan \"Revolution in Liberty\", the Frei administration embarked on far-reaching social and economic programs, particularly in education, housing, and agrarian reform, including rural unionization of agricultural workers. By 1967, however, Frei encountered increasing opposition from leftists, who charged that his reforms were inadequate, and from conservatives, who found them excessive. At the end of his term, Frei had not fully achieved his party's ambitious goals.[30]\nIn the 1970 election, Senator Salvador Allende of the Socialist Party of Chile (then part of the \"Popular Unity\" coalition which included the Communists, Radicals, Social-Democrats, dissident Christian Democrats, the Popular Unitary Action Movement, and the Independent Popular Action),[30] achieved a partial majority in a plurality of votes in a three-way contest, followed by candidates Radomiro Tomic for the Christian Democrat Party and Jorge Alessandri for the Conservative Party. Allende was not elected with an absolute majority, receiving fewer than 35% of the votes.\nThe Chilean Congress conducted a runoff vote between the leading candidates, Allende and former president Jorge Alessandri, and, keeping with tradition, chose Allende by a vote of 153 to 35. Frei refused to form an alliance with Alessandri to oppose Allende, on the grounds that the Christian Democrats were a workers' party and could not make common cause with the right wing.[42][43]\nAn economic depression that began in 1972 was exacerbated by capital flight, plummeting private investment, and withdrawal of bank deposits in response to Allende's socialist program. Production fell and unemployment rose. Allende adopted measures including price freezes, wage increases, and tax reforms, to increase consumer spending and redistribute income downward.[44] Joint public-private public works projects helped reduce unemployment.[45][page\u00a0needed] Much of the banking sector was nationalized. Many enterprises within the copper, coal, iron, nitrate, and steel industries were expropriated, nationalized, or subjected to state intervention. Industrial output increased sharply and unemployment fell during the Allende administration's first year.[45]\nAllende's program included advancement of workers' interests,[45][46] replacing the judicial system with \"socialist legality\",[47] nationalization of banks and forcing others to bankruptcy,[47] and strengthening \"popular militias\" known as MIR.[47] Started under former President Frei, the Popular Unity platform also called for nationalization of Chile's major copper mines in the form of a constitutional amendment. The measure was passed unanimously by Congress. As a result,[48] the Richard Nixon administration organized and inserted secret operatives in Chile, in order to swiftly destabilize Allende's government.[49] In addition, US financial pressure restricted international economic credit to Chile.[50]\nThe economic problems were also exacerbated by Allende's public spending which was financed mostly by printing money and poor credit ratings given by commercial banks.[51]\nSimultaneously, opposition media, politicians, business guilds and other organizations helped to accelerate a campaign of domestic political and economical destabilization, some of which was backed by the United States.[50][52] By early 1973, inflation was out of control. \nOn 26 May 1973, Chile's Supreme Court, which was opposed to Allende's government, unanimously denounced Allende's disruption of the legality of the nation. Although illegal under the Chilean constitution, the court supported and strengthened Pinochet's soon-to-be seizure of power.[47][53]\nA military coup overthrew Allende on 11 September 1973. As the armed forces bombarded the presidential palace, Allende apparently committed suicide.[54][55] After the coup, Henry Kissinger told U.S. president Richard Nixon that the United States had \"helped\" the coup.[56]\nA military junta, led by General Augusto Pinochet, took control of the country. The first years of the regime were marked by human rights violations. Chile actively participated in Operation Condor.[57] In October 1973, at least 72 people were murdered by the Caravan of Death.[58] According to the Rettig Report and Valech Commission, at least 2,115 were killed,[59] and at least 27,265[60] were tortured (including 88 children younger than 12 years old).[60] In 2011, Chile recognized an additional 9,800 victims, bringing the total number of killed, tortured or imprisoned for political reasons to 40,018.[61] At the national stadium, filled with detainees, one of those tortured and killed was internationally known poet-singer V\u00edctor Jara (see \"Music and Dance\", below).\nA new Constitution was approved by a controversial plebiscite on 11 September 1980, and General Pinochet became president of the republic for an eight-year term. After Pinochet obtained rule of the country, several hundred committed Chilean revolutionaries joined the Sandinista army in Nicaragua, guerrilla forces in Argentina or training camps in Cuba, Eastern Europe and Northern Africa.[62]\nIn the late 1980s, largely as a result of events such as the 1982 economic collapse[63] and mass civil resistance in 1983\u201388, the government gradually permitted greater freedom of assembly, speech, and association, to include trade union and political activity.[64] The government launched market-oriented reforms with Hern\u00e1n B\u00fcchi as Minister of Finance. Chile moved toward a free market economy that saw an increase in domestic and foreign private investment, although the copper industry and other important mineral resources were not opened to competition. In a plebiscite on 5 October 1988, Pinochet was denied a second eight-year term as president (56% against 44%). Chileans elected a new president and the majority of members of a bicameral congress on 14 December 1989. Christian Democrat Patricio Aylwin, the candidate of a coalition of 17 political parties called the Concertaci\u00f3n, received an absolute majority of votes (55%).[65] President Aylwin served from 1990 to 1994, in what was considered a transition period.\nIn December 1993, Christian Democrat Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, the son of previous president Eduardo Frei Montalva, led the Concertaci\u00f3n coalition to victory with an absolute majority of votes (58%).[66] Frei Ruiz-Tagle was succeeded in 2000 by Socialist Ricardo Lagos, who won the presidency in an unprecedented runoff election against Joaqu\u00edn Lav\u00edn of the rightist Alliance for Chile.[67] In January 2006, Chileans elected their first female president, Michelle Bachelet Jeria, of the Socialist Party, defeating Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era, of the National Renewal party, extending the Concertaci\u00f3n governance for another four years.[68][69] In January 2010, Chileans elected Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era as the first rightist President in 20 years, defeating former President Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle of the Concertaci\u00f3n, for a four-year term succeeding Bachelet. Due to term limits, Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era did not stand for re-election in 2013, and his term expired in March 2014 resulting in Michelle Bachelet returning to office.[70] Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era succeeded Bachelet again in 2018 as the President of Chile after winning the December 2017 presidential election.[71][72]\nOn 27 February 2010, Chile was struck by an 8.8 Mw earthquake, the fifth largest ever recorded at the time. More than 500 people died (most from the ensuing tsunami) and over a million people lost their homes. The earthquake was also followed by multiple aftershocks.[73] Initial damage estimates were in the range of US$15\u201330 billion, around 10% to 15% of Chile's real gross domestic product.[74]\nChile achieved global recognition for the successful rescue of 33 trapped miners in 2010. On 5 August 2010, the access tunnel collapsed at the San Jos\u00e9 copper and gold mine in the Atacama Desert near Copiap\u00f3 in northern Chile, trapping 33 men 700 meters (2,300\u00a0ft) below ground. A rescue effort organized by the Chilean government located the miners 17 days later. All 33 men were brought to the surface two months later on 13 October 2010 over a period of almost 24 hours, an effort that was carried on live television around the world.[75]\n2019\u201320 Chilean protests are a series of country-wide protests in response to a rise in the Santiago Metro's subway fare, the increased cost of living, privatization and inequality prevalent in the country.[76] On 15 November, most of the political parties represented in the National Congress signed an agreement to call a national referendum in April 2020 regarding the creation of a new Constitution, later postponed to October due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[77] On 25 October 2020, Chileans voted 78.28 per cent in favor of a new constitution, while 21.72 per cent rejected the change. Voter turnout was 51 percent. An election for the members of the Constitutional Convention was held in Chile between 15 and 16 May 2021.[78]\nOn 19 December 2021, a leftist candidate, the 35-year-old former student protest leader Gabriel Boric, won Chile's presidential election to become the country's youngest ever leader.[79] On 11 March 2022, Boric was sworn in as president to succeed outgoing President Sebastian Pinera.[80] Out of 24 members of Gabriel Boric's female-majority Cabinet, 14 are women.[81]\nOn 4 September 2022, voters rejected overwhelmingly the new constitution in the constitutional referendum, which was put forward by the constitutional convention. The rejected new constitution, supported strongly by president Boric, proved to be too radical and left-leaning for the majority of voters.[82]\nA long and narrow coastal Southern Cone country on the west side of the Andes Mountains, Chile stretches over 4,300\u00a0km (2,670\u00a0mi) north to south, but only 350\u00a0km (217\u00a0mi) at its widest point east to west[83] and 64\u00a0km (40\u00a0mi) at its narrowest point east to west, with an average width of 175\u00a0km (109\u00a0mi). This encompasses a remarkable variety of climates and landscapes. It contains 756,950 square kilometers (292,260\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of land area. It is situated within the Pacific Ring of Fire. Excluding its Pacific islands and Antarctic claim, Chile lies between latitudes 17\u00b0 and 56\u00b0S, and longitudes 66\u00b0 and 75\u00b0W.\nChile is among the longest north\u2013south countries in the world. If one considers only mainland territory, Chile is unique within this group in its narrowness from east to west, with the other long north\u2013south countries (including Brazil, Russia, Canada, and the United States, among others) all being wider from east to west by a factor of more than 10. Chile also claims 1,250,000\u00a0km2 (480,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of Antarctica as part of its territory (Chilean Antarctic Territory). However, this latter claim is suspended under the terms of the Antarctic Treaty, of which Chile is a signatory.[84] It is the world's southernmost country that is geographically on the mainland.[85]\nChile controls Easter Island and Sala y G\u00f3mez Island, the easternmost islands of Polynesia, which it incorporated to its territory in 1888, and the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands, more than 600\u00a0km (370\u00a0mi) from the mainland. Also controlled but only temporarily inhabited (by some local fishermen) are the small islands of San Ambrosio and San Felix. These islands are notable because they extend Chile's claim to territorial waters out from its coast into the Pacific Ocean.[86]\nThe northern Atacama Desert contains great mineral wealth, primarily copper and nitrates. The relatively small Central Valley, which includes Santiago, dominates the country in terms of population and agricultural resources. This area is also the historical center from which Chile expanded in the late 19th century when it integrated the northern and southern regions. Southern Chile is rich in forests, grazing lands, and features a string of volcanoes and lakes. The southern coast is a labyrinth of fjords, inlets, canals, twisting peninsulas, and islands. The Andes Mountains are located on the eastern border.\nChile is located along a highly seismic and volcanic zone, part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, due to the subduction of the Nazca and Antarctic plates in the South American plate. Late Paleozoic, 251 million years ago, Chile belonged to the continental block called Gondwana. It was just a depression that accumulated marine sediments began to rise at the end of the Mesozoic, 66 million years ago, due to the collision between the Nazca and South American plates, resulting in the Andes. The territory would be shaped over millions of years by the folding of the rocks, forming the current relief.\nThe Chilean relief consists of the central depression, which crosses the country longitudinally, flanked by two mountain ranges that make up about 80% of the territory: the Andes mountains to the east-natural border with Bolivia and Argentina in the region of Atacama and the Coastal Range west-minor height from the Andes. Chile's highest peak is the Nevado Ojos del Salado, at 6891.3 m, which is also the highest volcano in the world. The highest point of the Coastal Range is Vicu\u00f1a Mackenna, at 3114 meters, located in the Sierra Vicu\u00f1a Mackenna, the south of Antofagasta. Among the coastal mountains and the Pacific is a series of coastal plains, of variable length, which allow the settlement of coastal towns and big ports. Some areas of the plains territories encompass territory east of the Andes, and the Patagonian steppes and Magellan, or are high plateaus surrounded by high mountain ranges, such as the Altiplano or Puna de Atacama.\nThe Far North is the area between the northern boundary of the country and the parallel 26\u00b0 S, covering the first three regions. It is characterized by the presence of the Atacama desert, the aridest in the world. The desert is fragmented by streams that originate in the area known as the pampas Tamarugal. The Andes, split in two and whose eastern arm runs through Bolivia, has a high altitude and volcanic activity, which has allowed the formation of the Andean altiplano and salt structures as the Salar de Atacama, due to the gradual accumulation of sediments over time.\nTo the south is the Norte Chico, extending to the Aconcagua river. Los Andes begin to decrease its altitude to the south and closer to the coast, reaching 90\u00a0km away at the height of Illapel, the narrowest part of the Chilean territory. The two mountain ranges intersect, virtually eliminating the intermediate depression. The existence of rivers flowing through the territory allows the formation of transverse valleys, where agriculture has developed strongly in recent times, while the coastal plains begin to expand.\nThe Central area is the most populated region of the country. The coastal plains are wide and allow the establishment of cities and ports along the Pacific. The Andes maintain altitudes above 6000m but descend slowly in height to 4000 meters on average. The intermediate depression reappears becoming a fertile valley that allows agricultural development and human settlement, due to sediment accumulation. To the south, the Cordillera de la Costa reappears in the range of Nahuelbuta while glacial sediments create a series of lakes in the area of La Frontera.\nPatagonia extends from within Reloncavi, at the height of parallel 41\u00b0S, to the south. During the last glaciation, this area was covered by ice that strongly eroded Chilean relief structures. As a result, the intermediate depression sinks in the sea, while the coastal mountains rise to a series of archipelagos, such as Chilo\u00e9 and the Chonos, disappearing in Taitao peninsula, in the parallel 47\u00b0S. The Andes mountain range loses height and erosion caused by the action of glaciers has caused fjords. East of the Andes, on the continent, or north of it, on the island of Tierra del Fuego are located relatively flat plains, which in the Strait of Magellan cover large areas. The Andes, as he had done previously Cordillera de la Costa, begins to break in the ocean causing a myriad of islands and islets and disappear into it, sinking and reappearing in the Southern Antilles arc and then the Antarctic Peninsula, where it is called Antartandes, in the Chilean Antarctic Territory, lying between the meridians 53\u00b0W and 90\u00b0W.\nIn the middle of the Pacific, the country has sovereignty over several islands of volcanic origin, collectively known as Insular Chile. The archipelago of Juan Fernandez and Easter Island is located in the fracture zone between the Nazca plate and the Pacific plate known as East Pacific Rise.\nThe diverse climate of Chile ranges from the world's driest desert in the north\u2014the Atacama Desert\u2014through a Mediterranean climate in the center, humid subtropical in Easter Island, to an oceanic climate, including alpine tundra and glaciers in the east and south.[15] According to the K\u00f6ppen system, Chile within its borders hosts at least ten major climatic subtypes. There are four seasons in most of the country: summer (December to February), autumn (March to May), winter (June to August), and spring (September to November).\nDue to the characteristics of the territory, Chile is crossed by numerous rivers generally short in length and with low flow rates. They commonly extend from the Andes to the Pacific Ocean, flowing from East to West. Because of the Atacama desert, in the Norte Grande there are only short endorheic character streams, except for the Loa River, the longest in the country 440\u00a0km.[87] In the high valleys, wetland areas generate Chungar\u00e1 Lake, located at 4500 meters above sea level. It and the Lauca River are shared with Bolivia, as well as the Lluta River. In the center-north of the country, the number of rivers that form valleys of agricultural importance increases. Noteworthy are the Elqui with 75\u00a0km[87] long, 142\u00a0km Aconcagua, Maipo with 250\u00a0km[87] and its tributary, the Mapocho with 110\u00a0km, and Maule with 240\u00a0km. Their waters mainly flow from Andean snowmelt in the summer and winter rains. The major lakes in this area are the artificial lake Rapel, the Colbun Maule lagoon and the lagoon of La Laja.\nThe flora and fauna of Chile are characterized by a high degree of endemism, due to its particular geography. In continental Chile, the Atacama Desert in the north and the Andes mountains to the east are barriers that have led to the isolation of flora and fauna. Add to that the enormous length of Chile (over 4,300\u00a0km (2,672\u00a0mi)) and this results in a wide range of climates and environments that can be divided into three general zones: the desert provinces of the north, central Chile, and the humid regions of the south.\nThe native flora of Chile consists of relatively fewer species compared to the flora of other South American countries. \nThe northernmost coastal and central region is largely barren of vegetation, approaching the most absolute desert in the world.[88]\nOn the slopes of the Andes, in addition to the scattered tola desert brush, grasses are found. The central valley is characterized by several species of cacti, the hardy espinos, the Chilean pine, the southern beeches and the copihue, a red bell-shaped flower that is Chile's national flower.[88]\nIn southern Chile, south of the Biob\u00edo River, heavy precipitation has produced dense forests of laurels, magnolias, and various species of conifers and beeches, which become smaller and more stunted to the south.[89]\nThe cold temperatures and winds of the extreme south preclude heavy forestation. Grassland is found in Atlantic Chile (in Patagonia). Much of the Chilean flora is distinct from that of neighboring Argentina, indicating that the Andean barrier existed during its formation.[89]\nSome of Chile's flora has an Antarctic origin due to land bridges which formed during the Cretaceous ice ages, allowing plants to migrate from Antarctica to South America.[90] Chile had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 7.37/10, ranking it 43rd globally out of 172 countries.[91]\nJust over 3,000 species of fungi are recorded in Chile,[92][93] but this number is far from complete. The true total number of fungal species occurring in Chile is likely to be far higher, given the generally accepted estimate that only about 7 percent of all fungi worldwide have so far been discovered.[94] Although the amount of available information is still very small, a first effort has been made to estimate the number of fungal species endemic to Chile, and 1995 species have been tentatively identified as possible endemics of the country.[95]\nChile's geographical isolation has restricted the immigration of faunal life so that only a few of the many distinctive South American animals are found. Among the larger mammals are the puma or cougar, the llama-like guanaco and the fox-like chilla. In the forest region, several types of marsupials and a small deer known as the pudu are found.[88]\nThere are many species of small birds, but most of the larger common Latin American types are absent. Few freshwater fish are native, but North American trout have been successfully introduced into the Andean lakes.[88] Owing to the vicinity of the Humboldt Current, ocean waters abound with fish and other forms of marine life, which in turn support a rich variety of waterfowl, including several penguins. Whales are abundant, and some six species of seals are found in the area.[88]\nThe current Constitution of Chile was drafted by Jaime Guzm\u00e1n in 1980[96] and subsequently approved via a national plebiscite\u2014regarded as \"highly irregular\" by some observers[97]\u2014in September of that year, under the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. It entered into force in March 1981. After Pinochet's defeat in the 1988 plebiscite, the constitution was amended to ease provisions for future amendments to the Constitution. In September 2005, President Ricardo Lagos signed into law several constitutional amendments passed by Congress. These include eliminating the positions of appointed senators and senators for life, granting the President authority to remove the commanders-in-chief of the armed forces, and reducing the presidential term from six to four years.[98]\nChile's judiciary is independent and includes a court of appeal, a system of military courts, a constitutional tribunal, and the Supreme Court of Chile. In June 2005, Chile completed a nationwide overhaul of its criminal justice system.[99] The reform has replaced inquisitorial proceedings with an adversarial system with greater similarity to that of common law jurisdictions such as the United States.\nFor parliamentary elections, between 1989 and 2013 the binominal system was used, which promoted the establishment of two majority political blocs -Concertaci\u00f3n and Alliance- at the expense of the exclusion of non-majority political groups. The opponents of this system approved in 2015 a moderate proportional electoral system that has been in force since the 2017 parliamentary elections, allowing the entry of new parties and coalitions. The Congress of Chile has a 50-seat Senate and a 155-member Chamber of Deputies. Senators serve for eight years with staggered terms, while deputies are elected every 4 years. The last congressional elections were held on 21 November 2021, concurrently with the presidential election. The Congress is located in the port city of Valpara\u00edso, about 140 kilometers (90 miles) west of the capital, Santiago.\nThe main existing political coalitions in Chile are:\nGovernment:\nOpposition:\nIn the National Congress, Chile Vamos has 52 deputies and 24 senators, while the parliamentary group of Apruebo Dignidad is formed by 37 deputies and 6 senators. Democratic Socialism is the third political force with 30 deputies and 13 senators. The other groups with parliamentary representation are the Republican Party (15 deputies and 1 senator), the Christian Democratic Party (8 deputies and 5 senators), the Party of the People (8 deputies) and the independents outside of a coalition (5 deputies and 1 senator).\nSince the early decades after independence, Chile has always had an active involvement in foreign affairs. In 1837, the country aggressively challenged the dominance of Peru's port of Callao for preeminence in the Pacific trade routes, defeating the short-lived alliance between Peru and Bolivia, the Peru-Bolivian Confederation (1836\u201339) in the War of the Confederation. The war dissolved the confederation while distributing power in the Pacific. A second international war, the War of the Pacific (1879\u201383), further increased Chile's regional role, while adding considerably to its territory.[22]\nDuring the 19th century, Chile's commercial ties were primarily with Britain, a nation that had a major influence on the formation of the Chilean navy. The French, influenced Chile's legal and educational systems and had a decisive impact on Chile, through the architecture of the capital in the boom years at the turn of the 20th century. German influence came from the organization and training of the army by Prussians.[22]\nOn 26 June 1945, Chile participated as a founding member of the United Nations being among 50 countries that signed the United Nations Charter in San Francisco, California.[100][101] With the military coup of 1973, Chile became isolated politically as a result of widespread human rights abuses.[22]\nSince its return to democracy in 1990, Chile has been an active participant in the international political arena. Chile completed a two-year non-permanent position on the UN Security Council in January 2005. Jose Miguel Insulza, a Chilean national, was elected Secretary General of the Organization of American States in May 2005 and confirmed in his position, being re-elected in 2009. Chile is currently serving on the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors, and the 2007\u20132008 chair of the board is Chile's ambassador to the IAEA, Milenko E. Skoknic. The country is an active member of the UN family of agencies and participates in UN peacekeeping activities. It was re-elected as a member of the UN Human Rights Council in 2011 for a three-year term.[102] It was also elected to one of five non-permanent seats on the UN Security Council in 2013.[103] Chile hosted the Defense Ministerial of the Americas in 2002 and the APEC summit and related meetings in 2004. It also hosted the Community of Democracies ministerial in April 2005 and the Ibero-American Summit in November 2007. An associate member of Mercosur and a full member of APEC, Chile has been a major player in international economic issues and hemispheric free trade.[30]\nThe Armed Forces of Chile are subject to civilian control exercised by the president through the Minister of Defense. The president has the authority to remove the commanders-in-chief of the armed forces.[30]\nThe commander-in-chief of the Chilean Army is Army General Ricardo Mart\u00ednez Menanteau. The Chilean Army is 45,000 strong and is organized with an Army headquarters in Santiago, six divisions throughout its territory, an Air Brigade in Rancagua, and a Special Forces Command in Colina. The Chilean Army is one of the most professional and technologically advanced armies in Latin America.[30]\nAdmiral Julio Leiva Molina directs the around 25,000-person Chilean Navy,[104] including 2,500 Marines. Of the fleet of 29 surface vessels, only eight are operational major combatants (frigates). Those ships are based in Valpara\u00edso.[105] The Navy operates its own aircraft for transport and patrol; there are no Navy fighter or bomber aircraft. The Navy also operates four submarines based in Talcahuano.[30][106]\nAir Force General (four-star) Jorge Rojas \u00c1vila heads the 12,500-strong Chilean Air Force. Air assets are distributed among five air brigades headquartered in Iquique, Antofagasta, Santiago, Puerto Montt, and Punta Arenas. The Air Force also operates an airbase on King George Island, Antarctica. The Air Force took delivery of the final two of ten F-16s, all purchased from the U.S., in March 2007 after several decades of U.S. debate and previous refusal to sell. Chile also took delivery in 2007 of a number of reconditioned Block 15 F-16s from the Netherlands, bringing to 18 the total of F-16s purchased from the Dutch.[30]\nAfter the military coup in September 1973, the Chilean national police (Carabineros) were incorporated into the Defense Ministry. With the return of democratic government, the police were placed under the operational control of the Interior Ministry but remained under the nominal control of the Defense Ministry. Gen. Gustavo Gonz\u00e1lez Jure is the head of the national police force of 40,964[107] men and women who are responsible for law enforcement, traffic management, narcotics suppression, border control, and counter-terrorism throughout Chile.[30]\nIn 2017, Chile signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.[108]\nIn 1978 Chile was administratively divided into regions,[109] and in 1979 subdivided into provinces and these into communes.[110][111] In total the country has 16 regions,[112][113] 56 provinces and 348 communes.[114]\nEach region was designated by a name and a Roman numeral assigned from north to south, except for the Santiago Metropolitan Region, which did not have a number. The creation of two new regions in 2007, Arica and Parinacota (XV) and Los R\u00edos (XIV), and a third region in 2018, \u00d1uble (XVI) made this numbering lose its original order meaning.\nThe national flower is the copihue (Lapageria rosea, Chilean bellflower), which grows in the woods of southern Chile.\nThe coat of arms depicts the two national animals: the condor (Vultur gryphus, a very large bird that lives in the mountains) and the huemul (Hippocamelus bisulcus, an endangered white tail deer). It also has the legend Por la raz\u00f3n o la fuerza (By reason or by force).\nThe flag of Chile consists of two equal horizontal bands of white (top) and red; there is a blue square the same height as the white band at the hoist-side end of the white band; the square bears a white five-pointed star in the center representing a guide to progress and honor; blue symbolizes the sky, white is for the snow-covered Andes, and red stands for the blood spilled to achieve independence. The flag of Chile is similar to the Flag of Texas, although the Chilean flag is 21 years older. However, like the Texan flag, the flag of Chile is modeled after the Flag of the United States.[115]\nThe Central Bank of Chile in Santiago serves as the central bank for the country. The Chilean currency is the Chilean peso (CLP). Chile is one of South America's most stable and prosperous nations,[15] leading Latin American nations in human development, competitiveness, globalization, economic freedom, and low perception of corruption.[16] Since July 2013, Chile is considered by the World Bank as a \"high-income economy\".[116][117][118]\nChile has the highest degree of economic freedom in South America (ranking 7th worldwide), owing to its independent and efficient judicial system and prudent public finance management.[119] In May 2010 Chile became the first South American country to join the OECD.[120] In 2006, Chile became the country with the highest nominal GDP per capita in Latin America.[121] As of 2020, Chile ranks third in Latin America (behind Uruguay and Panama) in nominal GDP per capita.\nCopper mining makes up 20% of Chilean GDP and 60% of exports.[122] Escondida is the largest copper mine in the world, producing over 5% of global supplies.[122] Overall, Chile produces a third of the world's copper.[122] Codelco, the state mining firm, competes with private copper mining companies.[122]\nSound economic policies, maintained consistently since the 1980s, have contributed to steady economic growth in Chile and have more than halved poverty rates.[123][30] Chile began to experience a moderate economic downturn in 1999. The economy remained sluggish until 2003, when it began to show clear signs of recovery, achieving 4.0% GDP growth.[124] The Chilean economy finished 2004 with growth of 6%. Real GDP growth reached 5.7% in 2005 before falling back to 4% in 2006. GDP expanded by 5% in 2007.[30] Faced with the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008 the government announced an economic stimulus plan to spur employment and growth, and despite the Great Recession, aimed for an expansion of between 2% and 3% of GDP for 2009. Nonetheless, economic analysts disagreed with government estimates and predicted economic growth at a median of 1.5%.[125] Real GDP growth in 2012 was 5.5%. Growth slowed to 4.1% in the first quarter of 2013.[126]\nThe unemployment rate was 6.4% in April 2013.[127] There are reported labor shortages in agriculture, mining, and construction.[126] The percentage of Chileans with per capita household incomes below the poverty line\u2014defined as twice the cost of satisfying a person's minimal nutritional needs\u2014fell from 45.1% in 1987 to 11.5% in 2009, according to government surveys.[128][129] Critics in Chile, however, argue that true poverty figures are considerably higher than those officially published.[130] Using the relative yardstick favoured in many European countries, 27% of Chileans would be poor, according to Juan Carlos Feres of the ECLAC.[131]\nAs of November\u00a02012[update], about 11.1 million people (64% of the population) benefit from government welfare programs,[132][clarification needed] via the \"Social Protection Card\", which includes the population living in poverty and those at a risk of falling into poverty.[133] The privatized national pension system (AFP) has encouraged domestic investment and contributed to an estimated total domestic savings rate of approximately 21% of GDP.[134] Under the compulsory private pension system, most formal sector employees pay 10% of their salaries into privately managed funds.[30]\nChile has signed free trade agreements (FTAs) with a whole network of countries, including an FTA with the United States that was signed in 2003 and implemented in January 2004.[135] Internal Government of Chile figures show that even when factoring out inflation and the recent high price of copper, bilateral trade between the U.S. and Chile has grown over 60% since then.[30] Chile's total trade with China reached US$8.8 billion in 2006, representing nearly 66% of the value of its trade relationship with Asia.[30] Exports to Asia increased from US$15.2 billion in 2005 to US$19.7 billion in 2006, a 29.9% increase.[30] Year-on-year growth of imports was especially strong from a number of countries: Ecuador (123.9%), Thailand (72.1%), South Korea (52.6%), and China (36.9%).[30]\nChile's approach to foreign direct investment is codified in the country's Foreign Investment Law. Registration is reported to be simple and transparent, and foreign investors are guaranteed access to the official foreign exchange market to repatriate their profits and capital.[30]\nThe Chilean Government has formed a Council on Innovation and Competition, hoping to bring in additional FDI to new parts of the economy.[30]\nStandard & Poor's gives Chile a credit rating of AA-.[136] The Government of Chile continues to pay down its foreign debt, with public debt only 3.9% of GDP at the end of 2006.[30] The Chilean central government is a net creditor with a net asset position of 7% of GDP at end 2012.[126] The current account deficit was 4% in the first quarter of 2013, financed mostly by foreign direct investment.[126] 14% of central government revenue came directly from copper in 2012.[126]\nChile is rich in mineral resources, especially copper and lithium. It is thought that due to the importance of lithium for batteries for electric vehicles and stabilization of electric grids with large proportions of intermittent renewables in the electricity mix, Chile could be strengthened geopolitically. However, this perspective has also been criticized for underestimating the power of economic incentives for expanded production in other parts of the world.[137]\nThe country was, in 2019, the world's largest producer of copper,[138] iodine[139] and rhenium,[140] the second largest producer of lithium[141] and molybdenum,[142] the sixth largest producer of silver,[143] the seventh largest producer of salt,[144] the eighth largest producer of potash,[145] the thirteenth producer of sulfur[146] and the thirteenth producer of iron ore[147] in the world. The country also has considerable gold production: between 2006 and 2017, the country produced annual amounts ranging from 35.9 tonnes in 2017 to 51.3 tonnes in 2013.[148]\nAgriculture in Chile encompasses a wide range of different activities due to its particular geography, climate and geology and human factors. Historically agriculture is one of the bases of Chile's economy. Now agriculture and allied sectors like forestry, logging and fishing account for only 4.9% of the GDP as of 2007[update] and employ 13.6% of the country's labor force. Chile is one of the 5 largest world producers of cherry and blueberry, and one of the 10 largest world producers of grape, apple, kiwi, peach, plum and hazelnut, focusing on exporting high-value fruits.[149] Some other major agriculture products of Chile include pears, onions, wheat, maize, oats, garlic, asparagus, beans, beef, poultry, wool, fish, timber and hemp. Due to its geographical isolation and strict customs policies Chile is free from diseases such as mad cow disease, fruit fly and Phylloxera. This, its location in the Southern Hemisphere, which has quite different harvesting times from the Northern Hemisphere, and its wide range of agriculture conditions are considered Chile's main comparative advantages. However, Chile's mountainous landscape limits the extent and intensity of agriculture so that arable land corresponds only to 2.62% of the total territory. Chile currently utilizes 14,015 Hectares of agricultural land.[150]\nChile is the world's second largest producer of salmon, after Norway. In 2019, it was responsible for 26% of the global supply.[151] In wine, Chile is usually among the 10 largest producers in the world. In 2018 it was in 6th place.[152]\nTourism in Chile has experienced sustained growth over the last few decades. In 2005, tourism grew by 13.6%, generating more than 4.5 billion dollars of which 1.5 billion was attributed to foreign tourists. According to the National Service of Tourism (Sernatur), 2 million people a year visit the country. Most of these visitors come from other countries in the American continent, mainly Argentina; followed by a growing number from the United States, Europe, and Brazil with a growing number of Asians from South Korea and China.[153]\nThe main attractions for tourists are places of natural beauty situated in the extreme zones of the country: San Pedro de Atacama, in the north, is very popular with foreign tourists who arrive to admire the Incaic architecture, the altiplano lakes, and the Valley of the Moon.[citation needed] In Putre, also in the north, there is the Chungar\u00e1 Lake, as well as the Parinacota and the Pomerape volcanoes, with altitudes of 6,348 m and 6,282 m, respectively. Throughout the central Andes there are many ski resorts of international repute,[citation needed] including Portillo, Valle Nevado and Termas de Chill\u00e1n.\nThe main tourist sites in the south are national parks (the most popular is Conguill\u00edo National Park in the Araucan\u00eda)[154] and the coastal area around Tir\u00faa and Ca\u00f1ete with the Isla Mocha and the Nahuelbuta National Park, Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago and Patagonia, which includes Laguna San Rafael National Park, with its many glaciers, and the Torres del Paine National Park. The central port city of Valpara\u00edso, which is World Heritage with its unique architecture, is also popular.[citation needed] Finally, Easter Island in the Pacific Ocean is one of the main Chilean tourist destinations.\nFor locals, tourism is concentrated mostly in the summer (December to March), and mainly in the coastal beach towns.[citation needed] Arica, Iquique, Antofagasta, La Serena and Coquimbo are the main summer centers in the north, and Puc\u00f3n on the shores of Lake Villarrica is the main center in the south. Because of its proximity to Santiago, the coast of the Valpara\u00edso Region, with its many beach resorts, receives the largest number of tourists. Vi\u00f1a del Mar, Valpara\u00edso's more affluent northern neighbor, is popular because of its beaches, casino, and its annual song festival, the most important musical event in Latin America.[citation needed] Pichilemu in the O'Higgins Region is widely known as South America's \"best surfing spot\" according to Fodor's.[citation needed]\nIn November 2005 the government launched a campaign under the brand \"Chile: All Ways Surprising\" intended to promote the country internationally for both business and tourism.[155] Museums in Chile such as the Chilean National Museum of Fine Arts built in 1880, feature works by Chilean artists.\nChile is home to the world-renowned Patagonian Trail that resides on the border between Argentina and Chile. Chile recently launched a massive scenic route for tourism in hopes of encouraging development based on conservation. The Route of Parks covers 1,740 miles (2,800\u00a0km) and was designed by Tompkin Conservation (founders Douglas Tompkins and wife Kristine).[156]\nDue to Chile's topography a functioning transport network is vital to its economy. In 2020, Chile had 85,984\u00a0km (53,428\u00a0mi) of highways, with 21,289\u00a0km (13,228\u00a0mi) paved.[157] In the same year, the country had 3,347\u00a0km (2,080\u00a0mi) of duplicated highways, the second largest network in South America, after Brazil.[158] Since the mid-1990s, there has been a significant improvement in the country's roads, through bidding processes that allowed the construction of an efficient road network, with emphasis on the duplication of continuous 1,950\u00a0km (1,212\u00a0mi) of the Panamerican Highway (Chile Route 5) between Puerto Montt and Caldera (in addition to the planned duplication in the Atacama Desert area),[159] the excerpts in between Santiago, Valparaiso and the Central Coast, and the northern access to Concepci\u00f3n and the large project of the Santiago urban highways network, opened between 2004 and 2006.[160] Buses are now the main means of long-distance transportation in Chile, following the decline of its railway network.[161] The bus system covers the entire country, from Arica to Santiago (a 30-hour journey) and from Santiago to Punta Arenas (about 40 hours, with a change at Osorno).\nChile has a total of 372 runways (62 paved and 310 unpaved). Important airports in Chile include Chacalluta International Airport (Arica), Diego Aracena International Airport (Iquique), Andr\u00e9s Sabella G\u00e1lvez International Airport\n(Antofagasta), Carriel Sur International Airport (Concepci\u00f3n), El Tepual International Airport (Puerto Montt), Presidente Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo International Airport (Punta Arenas), La Araucan\u00eda International Airport (Temuco), Mataveri International Airport (Easter Island), the most remote airport in the world, as defined by distance to another airport, and the Comodoro Arturo Merino Ben\u00edtez International Airport (Santiago) with a traffic of 12,105,524 passengers in 2011. Santiago is headquarters of Latin America's largest airline holding company and Chilean flag carrier LATAM Airlines.\nChile has a telecommunication system which covers much of the country, including Chilean insular and Antarctic bases. Privatization of the telephone system began in 1988; Chile has one of the most advanced telecommunications infrastructure in South America with a modern system based on extensive microwave radio relay facilities and a domestic satellite system with 3 earth stations.[123] In 2012, there were 3.276 million main lines in use and 24.13 million mobile cellular telephone subscribers.[123] According to a 2012 database of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), 61.42% of the Chilean population uses the internet, making Chile the country with the highest internet penetration in South America.[162] The Chilean internet country code is \".cl\".\nChile's total energy supply (TES) was 23.0GJ per capita in 2020.[163] Energy in Chile is dominated by fossil fuels, with coal, oil and gas accounting for 73.4% of the total primary energy. Biofuels and waste account for another 20.5% of primary energy supply, with the rest sourced from hydro and other renewables.[163]\nElectricity consumption was 68.90 TWh in 2014. Main sources of electricity in Chile are hydroelectricity, gas, oil and coal. Renewable energy in the forms of wind and solar energy are also coming into use, encouraged by collaboration since 2009 with the United States Department of Energy. The electricity industry is privatized with ENDESA as the largest company in the field.\nIn 2021, Chile had, in terms of installed renewable electricity, 6,807 MW in hydropower (28th largest in the world), 3,137 MW in wind power (28th largest in the world), 4,468 MW in solar (22nd largest in the world), and 375 MW in biomass.[164] As the Atacama Desert has the highest solar irradiation in the world, and Chile has always had problems obtaining oil, gas and coal (the country basically does not produce them, so it has to import them), renewable energy is seen as the solution for the country's shortcomings in the energy field.[165][166]\nChile's 2017 census reported a population of 17,574,003. Its rate of population growth has been decreasing since 1990, due to a declining birth rate.[167] By 2050 the population is expected to reach approximately 20.2 million people.[168]\nMexican professor Francisco Lizcano, of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, estimated that 52.7% of Chileans were white, 39.3% were mestizo, and 8% were Amerindian.[169]\nIn 1984, a study called Sociogenetic Reference Framework for Public Health Studies in Chile, from the Revista de Pediatr\u00eda de Chile determined an ancestry of 67.9% European, and 32.1% Native American.[170][171] In 1994, a biological study determined that the Chilean composition was 64% European and 35% Amerindian.[172] The recent study in the Candela Project establishes that the genetic composition of Chile is 52% of European origin, with 44% of the genome coming from Native Americans (Amerindians), and 4% coming from Africa, making Chile a primarily mestizo country with traces of African descent present in half of the population.[173] Another genetic study conducted by the University of Brasilia in several South American countries shows a similar genetic composition for Chile, with a European contribution of 51.6%, an Amerindian contribution of 42.1%, and an African contribution of 6.3%.[174] In 2015 another study established genetic composition in 57% European, 38% Native American, and 2.5% African.[175]\nA public health booklet from the University of Chile states that 64% of the population is of Caucasian origin; \"predominantly White\" Mestizos are estimated to amount to a total of 35%, while Native Americans (Amerindians) comprise the remaining 5%.[176]\nDespite the genetic considerations, many Chileans, if asked, would self-identify as White. The 2011 Latinobar\u00f3metro survey asked respondents in Chile what race they considered themselves to belong to. Most answered \"White\" (59%), while 25% said \"Mestizo\" and 8% self-classified as \"indigenous\".[177] A 2002 national poll revealed that a majority of Chileans believed they possessed some (43.4%) or much (8.3%) \"indigenous blood\", while 40.3% responded that they had none.[178]\nThe 1907 census reported 101,118 Natives or 3.1% of the total population. Only those that practiced their native culture or spoke their native language were considered to be Natives, irrespective of their \"racial purity\".[179] In 2002 a census took place, directly asking the public whether they considered themselves as part of any of the eight Chilean ethnic groups, regardless of whether or not they maintained their culture, traditions and language, and 4.6% of the population (692,192 people) fitted that description of indigenous peoples in Chile. Of that number, 87.3% declared themselves Mapuche.[180] Most of the indigenous population shows varying degrees of mixed ancestry.[181]\nChile is one of 22 countries to have signed and ratified the only binding international law concerning indigenous peoples, the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989.[182] It was adopted in 1989 as the International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention 169. Chile ratified it in 2008. A Chilean court decision in November 2009, considered to be a landmark ruling on indigenous rights, made use of the convention. The Supreme Court decision on Aymara water rights upheld rulings by both the Pozo Almonte tribunal and the Iquique Court of Appeals and marks the first judicial application of ILO Convention 169 in Chile.[183]\nThe earliest European immigrants were Spanish colonisers who arrived in the 16th century.[184] The Amerindian population of central Chile was absorbed into the Spanish settler population in the beginning of the colonial period to form the large mestizo population that exists in Chile today; mestizos create modern middle and lower classes. In the 18th and 19th centuries, many Basques came to Chile where they integrated into the existing elites of Castilian origin. Postcolonial Chile was never a particularly attractive destination for migrants, owing to its remoteness and distance from Europe.[185][186] Europeans preferred to stay in countries closer to their homelands instead of taking the long journey through the Straits of Magellan or crossing the Andes.[185] European migration did not result in a significant change in the ethnic composition of Chile, except in the region of Magellan.[187] Spaniards were the only major European migrant group to Chile,[185] and there was never large-scale immigration such as that to Argentina or Brazil.[186] Between 1851 and 1924, Chile only received 0.5% of European immigration to Latin America, compared to 46% to Argentina, 33% to Brazil, 14% to Cuba, and 4% to Uruguay.[185] However, it is undeniable that immigrants have played a significant role in Chilean society.[186]\nMost of the immigrants to Chile during the 19th and 20th centuries came from France,[188] Great Britain,[189] Germany,[190] and Croatia,[191] among others. Descendants of different European ethnic groups often intermarried in Chile. This intermarriage and mixture of cultures and races have helped to shape the present society and culture of the Chilean middle and upper classes.[192] Also, roughly 500,000 of Chile's population is of full or partial Palestinian origin,[193][194] and 800,000 Arab descents.[195] Chile currently has 1.5 million of Latin American immigrants, mainly from Venezuela, Peru, Haiti, Colombia, Bolivia and Argentina; 8% of the total population in 2019, without counting descendants.[196][197] According to the 2002 national census, Chile's foreign-born population has increased by 75% since 1992.[198] As of November 2021, numbers of people entering Chile from elsewhere in Latin America have grown swiftly in the last decade, tripling in the last three years to 1.5 million, with arrivals stemming from humanitarian crises in Haiti (ca. 180,000) and Venezuela (ca 460,000).[199]\nAbout 85% of the country's population lives in urban areas, with 40% living in Greater Santiago. The largest agglomerations according to the 2002 census are Greater Santiago with 5.6 million people, Greater Concepci\u00f3n with 861,000\nand Greater Valpara\u00edso with 824,000.[200]\nAs of 2012[update], 66.6%[204] of Chilean population over 15 years of age claimed to adhere to the Roman Catholic church, a decrease from the 70%[205] reported in the 2002 census. In the same census of 2012, 17% of Chileans reported adherence to an Evangelical church (\"Evangelical\" in the census referred to all Christian denominations other than the Roman Catholic and Orthodox\u2014Greek, Persian, Serbian, Ukrainian, and Armenian\u2014churches, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or Mormons, Seventh-day Adventists, and Jehovah's Witnesses: essentially, those denominations generally still termed \"Protestant\" in most English-speaking lands, although Adventism is often considered an Evangelical denomination as well). Approximately 90% of Evangelical Christians are Pentecostal. but Wesleyan, Lutheran, Anglican, Episcopalian, Presbyterian, other Reformed, Baptist, and Methodist churches also are present amongst Chilean Evangelical churches.[206] Irreligious people, atheists, and agnostics account for around 12% of the population.\nBy 2015, the major religion in Chile remained Christianity (68%), with an estimated 55% of Chileans belonging to the Roman Catholic church, 13% to various Evangelical churches, and just 7% adhering to any other religion. Agnostics and atheist were estimated at 25% of the population.[207]\nChile has a Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed religious community, and is home to the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed mother temple, or continental House of Worship, for Latin America. Completed in 2016, it serves as a space for people of all religions and backgrounds to gather, meditate, reflect, and worship.[208] It is formed from cast glass and translucent marble and has been described as innovative in its architectural style.[209]\nThe Constitution guarantees the right to freedom of religion, and other laws and policies contribute to generally free religious practice. The law at all levels fully protects this right against abuse by either governmental or private actors.[206] Church and state are officially separate in Chile. A 1999 law on religion prohibits religious discrimination. \nHowever, the Roman Catholic church for mostly historical and social reasons enjoys a privileged status and occasionally receives preferential treatment.[210] Government officials attend Roman Catholic events as well as major Evangelical and Jewish ceremonies.[206]\nThe Chilean government treats the religious holidays of Christmas, Good Friday, the Feast of the Virgin of Carmen, the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul, the Feast of the Assumption, All Saints' Day, and the Feast of the Immaculate Conception as national holidays.[206] Recently, the government declared 31 October, Reformation Day, to be an additional national holiday, in honor of the Evangelical churches of the country.[211][212]\nThe patron saints of Chile are Our Lady of Mount Carmel and Saint James the Greater (Santiago).[213] In 2005, Pope Benedict XVI canonized Alberto Hurtado, who became the country's second native Roman Catholic saint after Teresa de los Andes.[214]\nThe Spanish spoken in Chile is distinctively accented and quite unlike that of neighboring South American countries because final syllables are often dropped, and some consonants have a soft pronunciation.[clarification needed] Accent varies only very slightly from north to south; more noticeable are the differences in accent based on social class or whether one lives in the city or the country. That the Chilean population was largely formed in a small section at the center of the country and then migrated in modest numbers to the north and south helps explain this relative lack of differentiation, which was maintained by the national reach of radio, and now television, which also helps to diffuse and homogenize colloquial expressions.[30]\nThere are several indigenous languages spoken in Chile: Mapudungun, Aymara, Rapa Nui, Chilean Sign Language and (barely surviving) Qawasqar and Yaghan, along with non-indigenous German, Italian, English, Greek and Quechua. After the Spanish conquest, Spanish took over as the lingua franca and the indigenous languages have become minority languages, with some now extinct or close to extinction.[216]\nGerman is still spoken to some extent in southern Chile,[217] either in small countryside pockets or as a second language among the communities of larger cities.\nThrough initiatives such as the English Opens Doors Program, the government made English mandatory for students in fifth grade and above in public schools. Most private schools in Chile start teaching English from kindergarten.[218] Common English words have been absorbed and appropriated into everyday Spanish speech.[219]\nThe Ministry of Health (Minsal) is the cabinet-level administrative office in charge of planning, directing, coordinating, executing, controlling and informing the public health policies formulated by the President of Chile. The National Health Fund (Fonasa), created in 1979, is the financial entity entrusted to collect, manage and distribute state funds for health in Chile. It is funded by the public. All employees pay 7% of their monthly income to the fund.[220]\nFonasa is part of the NHSS and has executive power through the Ministry of Health (Chile). Its headquarters are in Santiago and decentralized public service is conducted by various Regional Offices. More than 12 million beneficiaries benefit from Fonasa. Beneficiaries can also opt for more costly private insurance through Isapre.\nIn Chile, education begins with preschool until the age of 5. Primary school is provided for children between ages 6 and 13. Students then attend secondary school until graduation at age 17.\nSecondary education is divided into two parts: During the first two years, students receive a general education. Then, they choose a branch: scientific humanistic education, artistic education, or technical and professional education. Secondary school ends two years later on the acquirement of a certificate (licencia de ense\u00f1anza media).[221]\nChilean education is segregated by wealth in a three-tiered system \u2013 the quality of the schools reflects socioeconomic backgrounds:\nUpon successful graduation of secondary school, students may continue into higher education. The higher education schools in Chile consist of Chilean Traditional Universities and are divided into public universities or private universities. There are medical schools and both the Universidad de Chile and Universidad Diego Portales offer law schools in a partnership with Yale University.[223]\nFrom the period between early agricultural settlements and up to the late pre-Columbian period, northern Chile was a region of Andean culture that was influenced by altiplano traditions spreading to the coastal valleys of the north, while southern regions were areas of Mapuche cultural activities. Throughout the colonial period following the conquest, and during the early Republican period, the country's culture was dominated by the Spanish. Other European influences, primarily English, French, and German began in the 19th century and have continued to this day. German migrants influenced the Bavarian style rural architecture and cuisine in the south of Chile in cities such as Valdivia, Frutillar, Puerto Varas, Osorno, Temuco, Puerto Octay, Llanquihue, Faja Maisan, Pitrufqu\u00e9n, Victoria, Puc\u00f3n and Puerto Montt.[224][225][226][227][228]\nMusic in Chile ranges from folkloric, popular and classical music. Its large geography generates different musical styles in the north, center and south of the country, including also Easter Island and Mapuche music.[229] The national dance is the cueca. Another form of traditional Chilean song, though not a dance, is the tonada. Arising from music imported by the Spanish colonists, it is distinguished from the cueca by an intermediate melodic section and a more prominent melody.\nBetween 1950 and 1970 appears a rebirth in folk music leading by groups such as Los de Ram\u00f3n, Los Cuatro Huasos and Los Huasos Quincheros, among others[230] with composers such as Ra\u00fal de Ram\u00f3n, Violeta Parra and others. In the mid-1960s native musical forms were revitalized by the Parra family with the Nueva canci\u00f3n Chilena, which was associated with political activists and reformers such as V\u00edctor Jara, Inti-Illimani, and Quilapay\u00fan. Other important folk singer and researcher on folklore and Chilean ethnography, is Margot Loyola. Also, many Chilean rock bands like Los Jaivas, Los Prisioneros, La Ley, and Los Tres have reached international success. In February, annual music festivals are held in Vi\u00f1a del Mar.[231]\nChile is a country of poets.[232][233] Gabriela Mistral was the first Latin American to receive a Nobel Prize in Literature (1945). Chile's most famous poet is Pablo Neruda, who received the Nobel Prize for Literature (1971) and is world-renowned for his extensive library of works on romance, nature, and politics. His three highly personalized homes in Isla Negra, Santiago and Valpara\u00edso are popular tourist destinations.\nAmong the list of other Chilean poets are Carlos Pezoa V\u00e9liz, Vicente Huidobro, Gonzalo Rojas, Pablo de Rokha, Nicanor Parra, Ivonne Co\u00f1uecar and Ra\u00fal Zurita. Isabel Allende is the best-selling Chilean novelist, with 51 million of her novels sold worldwide.[234] Novelist Jos\u00e9 Donoso's novel The Obscene Bird of Night is considered by critic Harold Bloom to be one of the canonical works of 20th-century Western literature. Another internationally recognized Chilean novelist and poet is Roberto Bola\u00f1o whose translations into English have had an excellent reception from the critics.[235][236][237]\nChilean cuisine is a reflection of the country's topographical variety, featuring an assortment of seafood, beef, fruits, and vegetables. Traditional recipes include asado, cazuela, empanadas, humitas, pastel de choclo, pastel de papas, curanto, and sopaipillas.[238] Crudos is an example of the mixture of culinary contributions from the various ethnic influences in Chile. The raw minced llama, heavy use of shellfish, and rice bread were taken from native Quechua Andean cuisine, (although beef, brought to Chile by Europeans, is also used in place of the llama meat), lemon and onions were brought by the Spanish colonists, and the use of mayonnaise and yogurt was introduced by German immigrants, as was beer.\nThe folklore of Chile, cultural and demographic characteristics of the country, is the result of the mixture of Spanish and Amerindian elements that occurred during the colonial period. Due to cultural and historical reasons, they are classified and distinguished four major areas in the country: northern areas, central, southern and south. Most of the traditions of the culture of Chile have a festive purpose, but some, such as dances and ceremonies, have religious components.\n[239]\nChilean mythology is the mythology and beliefs of the Folklore of Chile. This includes Chilote mythology, Rapa Nui mythology and Mapuche mythology.\nChile's most popular sport is association football. Chile has appeared in nine FIFA World Cups which includes hosting the 1962 FIFA World Cup where the national football team finished third. Other results achieved by the national football team include two Copa Am\u00e9rica titles (2015 and 2016), two runners-up positions, one silver and two bronze medals at the Pan American Games, a bronze medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics and two third places finishes in the FIFA under-17 and under-20 youth tournaments. The top league in the Chilean football league system is the Chilean Primera Divisi\u00f3n, which is named by the IFFHS as the ninth strongest national football league in the world.[240]\nThe main football clubs are Colo-Colo, Universidad de Chile and Universidad Cat\u00f3lica. Colo-Colo is the country's most successful football club, having both the most national and international championships, including the coveted Copa Libertadores South American club tournament. Universidad de Chile was the last international champion (Copa Sudamericana 2011).\nTennis is Chile's most successful sport. Its national team won the World Team Cup clay tournament twice (2003 & 2004), and played the Davis Cup final against Italy in 1976. At the 2004 Summer Olympics the country captured gold and bronze in men's singles and gold in men's doubles (Nicol\u00e1s Mass\u00fa obtained two gold medals). Marcelo R\u00edos became the first Latin American man to reach the number one spot in the ATP singles rankings in 1998. Anita Lizana won the US Open in 1937, becoming the first woman from Latin America to win a Grand Slam tournament. Luis Ayala was twice a runner-up at the French Open and both R\u00edos and Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez reached the Australian Open men's singles finals. Gonz\u00e1lez also won a silver medal in singles at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.\nAt the Summer Olympic Games Chile boasts a total of two gold medals (tennis), seven silver medals (athletics, equestrian, boxing, shooting and tennis) and four bronze medals (tennis, boxing and football). In 2012, Chile won its first Paralympic Games medal (gold in Athletics).\nRodeo is the country's national sport and is practiced in the more rural areas of the nation. A sport similar to hockey called chueca was played by the Mapuche people during the Spanish conquest. Skiing and snowboarding are practiced at ski centers located in the Central Andes, and in southern ski centers near to cities as Osorno, Puerto Varas, Temuco and Punta Arenas. Surfing is popular at some coastal towns. Polo is professionally practiced within Chile, with the country achieving top prize in the 2008 and 2015 World Polo Championship.\nBasketball is a popular sport in which Chile earned a bronze medal in the first men's FIBA World Championship held in 1950 and won a second bronze medal when Chile hosted the 1959 FIBA World Championship. Chile hosted the first FIBA World Championship for Women in 1953 finishing the tournament with the silver medal. San Pedro de Atacama is host to the annual \"Atacama Crossing\", a six-stage, 250-kilometer (160\u00a0mi) footrace which annually attracts about 150 competitors from 35 countries. The Dakar Rally off-road automobile race has been held in both Chile and Argentina since 2009.\nThe cultural heritage of Chile consists, first, of its intangible heritage, composed of various cultural events and activities, such as visual arts, crafts, dances, holidays, cuisine, games, music and traditions.  Secondly, its tangible heritage consists of those buildings, objects and sites of archaeological, architectural, traditional, artistic, ethnographic, folkloric, historical, religious or technological significance scattered through Chilean territory.  Among them, some are declared World Heritage Sites by UNESCO, in accordance with the provisions of the Convention concerning the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage of 1972, ratified by Chile in 1980. These cultural sites are the Rapa Nui National Park (1995), the Churches of Chilo\u00e9 (2000), the historical district of the port city of Valpara\u00edso (2003), Humberstone and Santa Laura Saltpeter Works (2005) and the mining city Sewell (2006).\nIn 1999 Cultural Heritage Day was established as a way to honour and commemorate Chile's cultural heritage. It is an official national event celebrated in May every year.[241]", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile", " https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atacama_desert#bodyContent",

by multiple other names, was a war between Chile and a Bolivian\u2013Peruvian alliance from 1879 to 1884. Fought over Chilean claims on coastal Bolivian territory in the Atacama Desert, the war ended with a Chilean victory, which gained for the country a significant amount of resource-rich territory from Peru and Bolivia.\nThe war began over a nitrate taxation dispute between Bolivia and Chile, with Peru being drawn in due to its secret alliance with Bolivia. But historians have pointed to deeper origins of the war, such as the interest of Chile and Peru in the nitrate business, the long-standing rivalry between Chile and Peru, as well as political and economical disparities between Chile, Peru and Bolivia.[A] On February 14, 1879, Chile's armed forces occupied the Bolivian port city of Antofagasta, subsequently war between Bolivia and Chile was declared on March 1, 1879, and between Chile and Peru on April 5, 1879.\nBattles were fought in the Pacific Ocean, the Atacama Desert, the Peruvian deserts, and the mountainous interior of Peru. For the first five months, the war played out in a naval campaign, as Chile struggled to establish a marine resupply corridor for its forces in the world's driest desert. Afterwards, Chile's land campaign overcame the Bolivian and Peruvian armies. Bolivia withdrew after the Battle of Tacna, on May 26, 1880. Chilean forces occupied Peru's capital Lima in January 1881. Remnants and irregulars of the Peruvian army waged a guerrilla war but could not prevent war-weary Peruvian factions from reaching a peace deal with Chile involving territorial cessions.\nChile and Peru signed the Treaty of Anc\u00f3n on October 20, 1883. Bolivia signed a truce with Chile in 1884. Chile acquired the Peruvian territory of Tarapac\u00e1, the disputed Bolivian department of Litoral (turning Bolivia into a landlocked country), and temporary control over the Peruvian provinces of Tacna and Arica. In 1904, Chile and Bolivia signed the Treaty of Peace and Friendship, which established definite boundaries. The 1929 Tacna\u2013Arica compromise gave Arica to Chile and Tacna to Peru.\nThe conflict is also known as the \"Saltpeter War\", the \"Ten Cents War\" (in reference to the controversial ten-centavo tax imposed by the Bolivian government), and the \"Second Pacific War\".[10] It should not to be confused with the pre-Columbian Saltpeter War, in what is now Mexico, nor the \"Guano War\" as the Chincha Islands War is sometimes named.[11]  The war largely settled (or set up, depending on one's point of view) the \"Tacna-Arica dispute\", and is sometimes known by that name as well, although the details took decades to resolve.\nWanu (Spanish: guano) is a Quechua word for fertilizer.[12] Potassium nitrate (ordinary saltpeter) and sodium nitrate (Chile saltpeter) are nitrogen-containing compounds collectively referred to as salpeter, saltpetre, salitre, caliche, or nitrate. They are used as fertilizer, but have other important uses.\nAtacama is a Chilean region south of the Atacama Desert, which mostly coincides with the disputed Antofagasta province, known in Bolivia as Litoral.\nWhen most of South America gained independence from Spain and Portugal in the 19th century the demarcation of frontiers was uncertain, particularly in remote, thinly populated portions of the newly independent nations. Bolivia and Chile's Atacama border dispute, in the coastal territories between approximately the 23\u00b0 and 24\u00b0 South parallels, was just one of several longstanding border conflicts that arose in South America.[13]\nCobija, Paposo, Mejillones and the territory of Antofagasta appears on a 1793 map of Andr\u00e9s Baleato and the 1799 map of the Spanish Navy as inside the jurisdiction of Chile, pointing out the Loa River as an internal limit of the Spanish Empire between Chile and Peru, leaving Charcas without sea access.[14][15]\nThe dry climate of the Peruvian and Bolivian coasts had permitted the accumulation and preservation of vast amounts of high-quality guano deposits and sodium nitrate. In the 1840s, Europeans knew the value of guano and nitrate as fertilizer and the role of saltpeter in explosives. The Atacama Desert became economically important. Bolivia, Chile, and Peru were in the area of the largest reserves of a resource demanded by the world. During the Chincha Islands War (1864\u20131866), Spain, under Queen Isabella II, attempted to exploit an incident involving Spanish citizens in Peru to re-establish its influence over the guano-rich Chincha Islands.\nStarting from the Chilean silver rush in the 1830s, the Atacama was prospected and populated by Chileans.[16] Chilean and foreign enterprises in the region eventually extended their control to the Peruvian saltpeter works. In the Peruvian region of Tarapac\u00e1, Peruvians were a minority, behind both Chileans and Bolivians.[17]\nBolivia and Chile negotiated the Boundary Treaty of 1866,\" or the \"Treaty of Mutual Benefits,\" which established 24\u00b0 S \"from the littoral of the Pacific to the eastern limits of Chile\" as the mutual boundary. Both countries also agreed to share the tax revenue from mineral exports from the territory between 23\u00b0 and 25\u00b0 S. The bipartite tax collecting caused discontent, and the treaty lasted for only eight years.\nIn February 1873, Peru and Bolivia signed a secret treaty of alliance against Chile.[18] The last clause kept it secret as long as both parties considered its publication unnecessary, until it was revealed in 1879. Argentina, long involved in a dispute with Chile over the Strait of Magellan and Patagonia, was secretly invited to join the pact, and in September 1873, the Argentine Chamber of Deputies approved the treaty and 6,000,000 Argentine peso for war preparations.[19] Eventually, Argentina and Bolivia did not agree on the territories of Tarija and Chaco, and Argentina also feared an alliance of Chile with Brazil. The Argentine Senate postponed and then rejected the approval, but in 1875 and 1877, after border disputes with Chile flared up anew, Argentina sought to join the treaty.[20] At the onset of the war, in a renewed attempt, Peru offered Argentina the Chilean territories from 24\u00b0 to 27\u00b0 S if Argentina adhered to the pact and fought in the war.[21][22]\nHistorians including G. Bulnes,[23] Basadre,[24] and Yrigoyen[25] agree that the real intention of the treaty was to compel Chile to modify its borders according to the geopolitical interests of Argentina, Peru, and Bolivia, as Chile was militarily weak before the arrival of the Chilean ironclads Almirante Cochrane and Blanco Encalada.\nChile was not informed about the pact until it learned of it, at first cursorily by a leak in the Argentine Congress in September 1873, when the Argentine Senate discussed the invitation to join the Peru-Bolivia alliance.[19] The Peruvian mediator Antonio de Lavalle stated in his memoirs that he did not learn of it until March 1879, and Hilarion Daza was not informed of the pact until December 1878.[26]\nThe Peruvian historian Basadre states that one of Peru's reasons for signing the treaty was to impede a Chilean-Bolivian alliance against Peru that would have given to Bolivia the region of Arica (almost all Bolivian commerce went through Peruvian ports of Arica before the war) and transferred Antofagasta to Chile.[27] The Chilean offers to Bolivia to change allegiance were made several times even during the war[28] and also from the Bolivian side at least six times.[27]\nOn December 26, 1874, the recently built ironclad Cochrane arrived in Valpara\u00edso and remained in Chile until the completion of the Blanco Encalada. That threw the balance of power in the South Pacific toward Chile.[29]\nHistorians disagree on how to interpret the treaty. Some Peruvian and Bolivian historians assess it as rightful, defensive, circumstantial, and known by Chile from the very onset. Conversely, some Chilean historians assess the treaty as aggressive against Chile, causing the war, designed to take control by Peru of the Bolivian nitrate and hidden from Chile. The reasons for its secrecy, its invitation to Argentina to join the pact, and Peru's refusal to remain neutral are still discussed.[30]\nIn 1874, Chile and Bolivia replaced the 1866 boundary treaty by keeping the boundary at 24\u00b0 S but granting Bolivia the authority to collect all tax revenue between 23\u00b0 and 24\u00b0 S. To compensate for the relinquishment of its rights, Chile received a 25-year guarantee against tax increases on Chilean commercial interests and their exports.\nArticle 4 explicitly forbade tax increases on Chilean enterprises for 25 years:\nThe duties of exportation that may be levied on minerals exploited in the zone referred to in the preceding articles shall not exceed those now in force, and Chilean citizens, industry, and capital shall not be subjected to any other contributions what ever except those now existing. The stipulations in this article shall last for twenty-five years.\nAll disputes arising under the treaty would be settled by arbitration.\nThe American historian William F. Sater gives several possible and compatible reasons for the war.[31] He considers the causes to be domestic, economic, and geopolitical. Several authors agree with them, but others only partially support his arguments.\nSome historians argue that Chile was devastated by the economic crisis of the 1870s[32] and was looking for a replacement for its silver, copper and wheat exports.[33] It has been argued that the economic situation and the view of new wealth in nitrate were the true reasons for the Chilean elite to go to war against Peru and Bolivia.[33][34] The holder of the Chilean nitrate companies, according to Sater, \"bulldozed\" Chilean President An\u00edbal Pinto into declaring war to protect the owner of the Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Salitres y Ferrocarril de Antofagasta (CSFA) and then to seize Bolivia's and Peru's salitreras (saltpeter works). Several members of the Chilean government were shareholders of CSFA, and they are believed to have hired the services of one of the country's newspapers to push their case.[31]\nAnother American historian, David Healy,[35] rejects that thesis, and Fredrick B. Pike calls the allegation \"absurd.\"[36] The economic development that accompanied and followed the war was so remarkable that Marxist writers feel justified in alleging that Chile's great military adventure was instigated by self-seeking capitalists to bring their country out of the business stagnation that had begun in 1878 since the war provided Chile with the economic means to come of age. Sater states that that interpretation overlooks certain important facts. The Chilean investors in Bolivia correctly feared that Daza, the Bolivian dictator, would use the war as an excuse to expropriate their investments. Among them were Melchor de Concha y Toro, the politically powerful president of Chile's Camara de Diputados, Jer\u00f3nimo Urmeneta,[37]:\u200a105\u200a and Lorenzo Claro, a Chilean founder of the Banco de Bolivia and a prominent member of the National Party. A Santiago newspaper claimed that Melchor de Concha y Toro offered President Pinto 2,000,000 Chilean pesos to end the dispute and to return to the 1874 border. \"In other words,\" writes W. Sater, \"there were as many powerful interests opposed to helping the Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Salitres as there were those seeking to aid the corporation.\"[38] Also, B. Farcau objects to the argument: \"On the other hand, the sorry state of the Chilean armed forces at the outbreak of the war, as will be discussed in the following chapter, hardly supports a theory of conscious, premeditated aggression.\"[39]\nSater cites other sources that state that the true causes of the conflict were not economic but geopolitical, a struggle for control of the southeastern portion of the Pacific Ocean. In 1836 the Peruvian government tried to monopolize commerce in the South Pacific by rewarding ships that sailed directly to Callao, to the detriment of Valpara\u00edso.[40] Peru tried to impede the agreement that had been reached between Spain and Chile to free its new warships built and embargoed in Britain during the Chincha Islands War. Sater cites Germany's minister in Chile, who argued that the war with Peru and Bolivia would \"have erupted sooner or later, [and] on any pretext.\" He considered that Bolivia and Peru had developed a \"bitter envy\" against Chile and its material progress and good government.[41] Frederik B. Pike states: \"The fundamental cause for the eruption of hostilities was the mounting power and prestige and the economic and political stability of Chile, on one hand, and the weakness and the political and economic deterioration of Bolivia, on the other.... The war\u2014and its outcome\u2014was as inevitable as the 1846\u20141848 conflict between the United States and Mexico. In both instances, a relatively well-governed, energetic, and economically expanding nation had been irresistibly tempted by neighboring territories that were underdeveloped, malgoverned, and sparsely occupied.\"[42]:\u200a128\nAnother reason, according to Sater, was Peru's desire to monopolize and appropriate the nitrate works to strengthen its nitrate monopoly, which required the Bolivian and Chilean salitreras to be controlled by Peru.[43] As unenviable as Chile\u2019s situation was in the 1870s, that of Peru was much worse. The 1870s was for Peru's economy \"a decade of crisis and change\".[44] Nitrate extraction rose while guano exports, the source of substantial revenue for Peru, declined from 575,000 tons in 1869 to less than 350,000 tons in 1873, and the Chincha Islands and other guano islands were depleted or nearly so.[44]\nWilliam Edmundson writes in A History of the British Presence in Chile,[45] \"Peru has its own reasons to enter the dispute. Rory Miller (1993) argues that the depletion of guano resources and poor management of the economy in Peru had provoked a crisis. This has caused Peru to default on its external debt in 1876.... In that year [1875] the Peruvian government decided to procure a loan of seven millions pounds of which four millions pounds were earmarked to purchase privately owned oficinas [salitreras]... and Peru defaulted again in 1877.\"\nTo increase guano revenue, Peru created a monopoly on nitrate commerce in 1875. Its aims were to increase prices, curb exports and to impede competition, but most larger nitrate firms opposed the monopoly on sales of nitrate.[44] When they were unsuccessful, Peru in 1876 began to expropriate nitrate producers[46] and to buy nitrate concessions such as that of Henry Meiggs in Bolivia (\"Toco\", south of the Loa River).[44] However, the CSFA was too expensive to be purchased.[47] As Peruvian historian Alejandro Reyes states, the Bolivian salitreras needed to be controlled, which resulted in the internationalization of the conflict since they were owned by Chilean and European merchants.[43] As the Chilean company was to be auctioned on February 14, 1879, in Antofagasta, it was considered that the Peruvian consul would be the highest bidder.[48]\nHowever, some sources, according to Sater, see the declarations of war between Chile and Peru as a product of popular domestic forces. The Peruvian President had to declare war to keep his position. Sater cites the British minister in Lima, Spencer St. John: \"the rival parties may try to make political capital out of jealousy for the national honor, and His Excellency [Peruvian President Prado] may be forced to give way to the popular sentiment.\"[49] Chilean President Pinto was under similar pressures.[50] Bruce Farcau considers that to be the main cause for the war outbreak: \"The argument that the attitude of the peoples of the region was just ripe for war seems best to fit the bill.\"[39]\nBeginning in 1866, the Chilean entrepreneurs Jos\u00e9 Santos Ossa and Francisco Puelma had exploited deposits of sodium nitrate in Bolivian territory (the salitreras \"Las Salinas\" and \"Carmen Alto\", 122 kilometres (76\u00a0mi) and 128 kilometres (80\u00a0mi) from Antofagasta, respectively) and secured concessions from Bolivian President Mariano Melgarejo.\nIn 1868, a company named Compa\u00f1\u00eda Melbourne Clark was established in Valpara\u00edso, Chile,[51] with 34% British capital[52] provided by Antony Gibbs & Sons of London, which also held shares of salitreras in Peru. Its shareholders included a number of leading Chilean politicians.[53] The company obtained a license from the Melgarejo administration to construct a railroad from Antofagasta to Salinas, and was renamed Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Salitres y Ferrocarril de Antofagasta (CSFA).\nIn 1871, a new Bolivian government canceled all contracts signed by Melgarejo, but on November 22, 1872, a Bolivian decree allowed the government to renegotiate the contracts.\nOn November 27, 1873, CSFA obtained a license from the new administration in Bolivia to exploit saltpeter without duty for 15 years, but a dispute arose regarding whether the original 1872 decree, under which the 1873 license was issued, required the authorization of the Bolivian Congress.[B] Some lawyers placed emphasis on con cargo a dar cuenta a la pr\u00f3xima legislatura (Spanish for: \"to be considered during the next legislative session [of the parliament]\"), but others on s\u00f3lo en los casos de no avenimiento (Spanish for \"only in cases that no settlement [is reached]\").\nIn 1873, the Peruvian government dictated the Ley del estanco del salitre, which limited the saltpeter production and authorized the government to purchase the whole production to a fixed price. However, the plan failed, and the law was repealed. In 1875, the Peruvian government expropriated the salitreras of Tarapac\u00e1 to create a monopoly in guano and nitrate, and in 1876, Antony Gibbs & Sons became the consignee of the nitrate trade for the Peruvian government.[54] President Mariano Ignacio Prado was \"determined to complete the monopoly,\" and in 1876, Peru bought the nitrate licenses for \"El Toco\" auctioned by a Bolivian decree of January 13, 1876.[55] However, the Chilean company remained the most serious competitor and clearly weakened Peru's monopoly.[56] President Pardo, Prado's predecessor, had urged Gibbs to secure the monopoly by limiting the CSFA's output,[57] and Henry Gibbs had warned the CSFA's board of directors in a letter on April 16, 1878, that its refusal to limit its output would bring administrative trouble with Peru and Bolivia \"as it is made more and more to the interest of a neighboring Government that they should be so.\"[55]\nGibbs made repeated unsuccessful efforts in 1876 and 1877 to persuade Edwards, the Chilean majority shareholder, to accept a limit to its production.[58][59]\nThe historian Ronald Bruce St. John in Foreign Policy of Peru states,[60] \"Although persuasive evidence linking Peru to either the ten-centavo tax or Bolivia's decision to confiscate Chilean holdings in Antofagasta never surfaced, it must be recognized that Peruvian interests had deep-seated economical and political reasons for going to war.\"\nIn 1875, the city of Antofagasta had attempted to impose a 3 cents tax on the CSFA, but the Bolivian State Council (Consejo de Estado), headed by Serapio Reyes Ortiz, who would be Minister of Foreign Affairs during the crisis, rejected the tax because it violated the license of 1873 and the Boundary Treaty of 1874.[61]\nOn February 14, 1878, the National Congress of Bolivia and the National Constituent Assembly approved the 1873 license if the company paid a 10 cents per quintal tax,[62] but the company objected by citing the 1874 treaty that the increased payments were illegal and demanded an intervention from the Chilean government.[63]\nThe CSFA's directory board perceived the tax as a Peruvian move to displace Chileans from the nitrate production, as had occurred in Tarapac\u00e1 in 1875 when the Peruvian government expropriated the salitreras.[64]\nHaving surrendered its claim to the disputed territories in return for a Bolivian promise to avoid increasing the tax,[65] Chile claimed that the treaty did not allow for such a tax hike.[53] Bolivia suspended the tax in April 1878. In November, Chile proposed mediation and cautioned that Daza's refusal to cancel the tax would force Chile to declare null the 1874 treaty. In December 1878, Bolivia, counting on its military alliance with Peru, challenged Chile, stated the tax was unrelated to the treaty and that the claim of the CSFA should be addressed in Bolivian courts, and revived the tax.[51] When the company refused to pay the tax, Bolivia confiscated its property on February 11 and threatened to sell it on February 14 to liquidate the company's debt.[66]\nIn December 1878, Chile had dispatched a warship to the area. On February 6, the Bolivian government nullified the CSFA's exploitation license and confiscated the property. The news reached Valpara\u00edso on February 11 and so the Chilean government decided on the occupation of the region of Antofagasta south of 23\u00b0 South.[67] On the day of the planned auction, 200 Chilean soldiers arrived by ship at the port city of Antofagasta and seized it without resistance. The occupying forces received widespread support from the local population, 93\u201395% of which was Chilean.[68][69][70]\nThe Bolivian territory between 23\u00b0 South and the Loa River, the border with Peru, remained unoccupied by Chilean forces almost one month after the Bolivian declaration of war.[71] On March 21, Cobija and then Calama, Tocopilla, and other hamlets were occupied. The Chilean government asked the Bolivian office-holders to remain in office, but they refused.[72]\nOn February 22, Peru sent a diplomatic team headed by Jos\u00e9 Antonio de Lavalle to Santiago to act as a mediator between the Chilean and the Bolivian governments. Peru meanwhile ordered its fleet and army to prepare for war.[31] De Lavalle arrived in Valpara\u00edso on March 4. On February 27, Daza had made a public manifesto to inform the Bolivians on the occupation of Antofagasta and to call for patriotic support. The same day, the Bolivian legislature authorized a formal declaration of war upon Chile although it was not immediately announced. On March 1, Daza issued instead a decree to prohibit all commerce and communications with Chile \"while the state-of-war provoked upon Bolivia lasts.\" It provided Chileans ten days to leave Bolivian territory unless they were gravely ill or handicapped and  embargoed Chilean furniture, property, and mining produce; allowed Chilean mining companies to continue operating under a government-appointed administrator; and provided all embargoes as temporary \"unless the hostilities exercised by Chilean forces requires an energetic retaliation from Bolivia.\"\nIn Santiago, Lavalle asked for Chile's withdrawal from Antofagasta to transfer the province to a tripartite administration of Bolivia, Chile, and Peru without Bolivia guaranteeing to end the embargo or to cancel the new tax.[73]\nOn March 14, in a meeting with foreign powers in Lima, Bolivia announced that a state of war existed with Chile.[63][74] The declaration was aimed to impede further Chilean arms purchases in Europe and to scuttle the Peruvian mediation in Chile.[75] Bolivia called on Peru to activate the treaty of alliance arguing that Chile's invasion was a casus foederis.\nAlso on March 14, Alejandro Fierro, Chile's minister of foreign affairs, sent a telegram to Chile's representative in Lima, Joaquin Godoy, to request the immediate neutrality of the Peruvian government. On March 17, Godoy formally presented the Chilean proposal in a meeting with Peruvian President Prado.[76]:\u200a147ff\nOn March 21, Godoy telegraphed the Chilean government on the secret treaty between Peru and Bolivia, which had been revealed to him by Peruvian President Prado.[76]:\u200a154ff\nOn March 23, on their way to occupy Calama, 554 Chilean troops and cavalry defeated 135 Bolivian soldiers and civilians, who were dug in at two destroyed bridges next to the Top\u00e1ter ford. The Battle of Top\u00e1ter was the first battle of the war.\nWhen the Chilean government asked Lavalle directly and officially whether a defensive alliance existed that committed Peru to assist Bolivia in a war with Chile and whether Lima planned to honor the agreement, Lavalle could prevaricate no longer and answered yes to both. Chilean President Pinto sought and received legislative approval to declare war, which he did on 5. April 1879.[31] Peru responded on April 6, when Prado declared the casus foederis.[77]\nHistorians agree that the belligerents were not prepared for the war financially or militarily.[78] None of the three nations had a General Staff,[79] medical corps,[80] or military logistics[79] and their warships were in a deplorable state.[81] In Chile, for example, the military contingent had been reduced continuously from 3,776 (by 1867) to 2,400 (by 1879) men,[82]:\u200a140\u200a and no military unit was deployed north of Valpara\u00edso, 1700\u00a0km south of Iquique.[82]:\u200a143\u200a By the end of the war, 53% of chief engineers serving in Chilean warships were foreigners. The government of Peru was again in default of payment, and in Bolivia, famine spread over the country.\nAccording to William Sater, Chile and Peru enlisted temporarily 2% of the male population but Bolivia only 1%.[83] After the Battle of Tacna, both of the Allied armies were disbanded and had to be formed again.\nThe Allied forces, at first glance, had some advantages over the Chilean forces. Their population and armies doubled the Chileans in numbers, and the Peruvian port of Callao's powerful artillery was impregnable for the Chilean navy and a secure haven for the Peruvian navy. In Callao, an English company offered the service of a floating dock for ships up to 3000 tonnes, and the Peruvian government used it to repair their ships at the outset of the war.[84]:\u200a119\u200a Those are some reasons that led the international press to expect a Chilean defeat as the war started.[85][86][87] Moreover, the ambivalent Argentine position and the ongoing Mapuche conflict overshadowed the Chilean perspective.[86]:\u200a109\u200a Jorge Basadre commented on the public opinion in Peru and Bolivia: \"They ignored the real power of Chile and the horrors of war, and simple minded people believed that the Allied would win the war because they together were bigger than Chile.\"[88]\nHowever, other observers[89] made a more in-depth analysis, which showed Chilean political and military advantages. Chile had a stable political system since 1833 that had developed and strengthened its institutions. The Chilean army and the navy had educated officers,[90] soldiers with professional experience in the Mapuche conflict,[84]:\u200a43\u200a and uniformly modern arms. Almost all Chilean soldiers were armed with Comblain or Gras rifles. The Chilean navy also possessed two new ironclads, which were invincible against the older Peruvian warships. Although there was interference between military and government over policy during the war, the primacy of the government was never questioned.[91] The Chilean supply line from Europe through the Magellan Strait was only once threatened unsuccessfully by the Peruvian navy.\nThe Allied armies were heavily involved in domestic politics and neglected their military duties, and poor planning and administration caused them to buy different rifles with different calibers. That hampered the instruction of conscripts, the maintenance of arms, and the supply of ammunition. The Peruvian navy warships manned before the war by Chilean sailors had to be replaced by foreign crews when the war began.[92] Bolivia had no navy. The Allied armies had nothing comparable to the Chilean cavalry and artillery.\nIts few roads and railroad lines made the nearly waterless and largely unpopulated Atacama Desert difficult to occupy. From the beginning, naval superiority was critical.[93] Bolivia had no navy[94] and so on March 26, 1879, Hilari\u00f3n Daza formally offered letters of marque to any ships willing to fight for Bolivia.[95] The Armada de Chile and the Marina de Guerra del Per\u00fa fought the naval battles.\nEarly on, Chile blockaded the Peruvian port of Iquique on April 5.[96]\nIn the Battle of Iquique, on May 21, 1879, the Peruvian ironclad Hu\u00e1scar engaged and sank the wooden Esmeralda. Meanwhile, during the Battle of Punta Gruesa, the Peruvian ironclad Independencia struck a submerged rock and sank in the shallow waters near Punta Gruesa while chasing the schooner Covadonga. Peru broke the blockade of Iquique, and Chile lost the old Esmeralda, but the loss of the Independencia cost Peru 40% of its naval offensive power.[97] It also made a strong impression upon military leaders in Argentina, and the possibility of Argentina's intervention in the war became far more remote.[98]\nDespite being outnumbered, the Peruvian monitor Hu\u00e1scar held off the Chilean Navy for six months and upheld Peru's morale during the early stages of the conflict.[99]:\u200a108\nThe capture of the steamship R\u00edmac on July 23, 1879, carrying a cavalry regiment (the Carabineros de Yungay) was the Chilean Army's largest loss until then.[100] That led to the resignation of Contraalmirante (Rear Admiral) Juan Williams Rebolledo, the chief of the Chilean Navy, on August 17. Commodore Galvarino Riveros C\u00e1rdenas replaced him and devised a plan to catch the Hu\u00e1scar.[101]\nMeanwhile, the Peruvian navy pursued other actions, particularly in August 1879 when the Uni\u00f3n unsuccessfully raided Punta Arenas, near the Strait of Magellan, in an attempt to capture the British merchant ship Gleneg, which was transporting weapons and supplies to Chile.[102]\nThe Battle of Angamos proved decisive on October 8, 1879, and Peru was reduced almost exclusively to land forces.[104] In the battle, the Chilean Navy captured the Hu\u00e1scar after several hours of fierce fighting, even though her surviving crewmen sought to scuttle her.[104] The Chilean Navy was thereafter free to carry troops for the invasion of Peru and to provide fire support for amphibious assault and other troops operating in the conflict areas. Chilean warships also had to impose a naval blockade of Peruvian ports and end the smuggling of arms from Panama into Peru via the Pacific.\nAfter the battle, despite the loss of both of Peru's main ships, the Peruvians used simple and ingenious ruses to sink two important Chilean ships, the Loa (July 1880) and the Covadonga (August 1880),[105] but its remaining vessels were locked in Callao during its long blockade by the Chileans.\nOn the other hand, the Chilean Navy captured the ship Pilcomayo in November 1879 and the torpedo boat Alay in December 1880.\nWhen Lima fell after the Battles of Chorrillos and Miraflores, the Peruvian naval officers scuttled their remaining fleet to prevent its capture by the Chilean forces.[106]\nDuring the Sierra campaign, Chilean ships were dedicated to guarding the Peruvian coast and transporting military detachments and war material for land operations.\nIn November 1883, during the final phase of the war, the Chilean military command sent the Chilean torpedo boat\u00a0Colo Colo to Lake Titicaca, via railroad, from Mollendo to Puno to control that lake. The presence of the torpedo boat prevented communications through this route and its use for military purposes, and the Peruvian vessels that had taken refuge in the vicinity surrendered to the Chileans. The deployment of the torpedo boat also induced the Bolivian government to agree to a peace treaty with Chile in 1884.[107][108]\nAfter the Battle of Angamos, once Chile achieved naval supremacy, the government had to decide where to strike. The options were Tarapac\u00e1, Moquegua or directly Lima. Because of its proximity to Chile and the capture of the Peruvian Salitreras, Chile decided to occupy the Peruvian province of Tarapac\u00e1 first.\nArica and Iquique were isolated and separated by the Atacama Desert; since the capture of the Hu\u00e1scar in October 1879, neither port had naval protection needed to be adequately supplied by sea. Without any communication or withdrawal lines, the area was essentially cut off from the rest of Peru.[109] After the loss of its naval capabilities, Peru had the option to withdraw to central Peru to strengthen its army around Lima until the re-establishment of a naval balance or to build up new alliances, as hinted by the Chilean historian Wilhelm Ekdahl. However, Jorge Basadre assumes that it would have been \"striking and humiliating\" to abandon Tarapac\u00e1, the source of Peru's wealth.[110]\nOn April 30, 1879, after 13 days of marching, 4,500 Bolivian soldiers, commanded by Daza, arrived in Tacna, a town 100\u00a0km (60\u00a0mi) north of Arica. The Bolivians had come to join the Peruvian forces, commanded by Juan Buendia. The Allied forces were deployed to the places that a Chilean landing could be expected; the Iquique-Pisagua or Arica-Tacna regions. There were reserves stationed at Arequipa, farther north in Peru, under Lizardo Montero, as well as in southern Bolivia, under Narciso Campero[C] The reserves were to be deployed to the coast after a landing but failed to arrive.\nThe land war can be seen as four Chilean military campaigns that successively occupied Tarapac\u00e1, Arica-Tacna, and Lima and a final campaign that ended the Peruvian resistance in the sierra. The occupation of Arequipa and Puno at the end of the war  saw little military action.\nThe Campaign of Tarapac\u00e1 began on November 2, 1879, when nine steam transporters escorted by half of the Chilean Navy transported 9,500 men and more than 850 animals to Pisagua, some 500 kilometres (310\u00a0mi) north of Antofagasta. After neutralizing the coastal batteries, the Chileans landed and attacked beach defenses in Pisagua.[112]\nIn the event of a Chilean landing, the Allied forces planned to counterattack the Chilean forces in a pincer movement involving advances from the north (Daza's forces coming from Arica) and from the south (Buendia's forces coming from Iquique). Although Peruvian forces marched northwards as planned after the fall of Pisagua, Daza, coming from Arica, decided in Camarones (44\u00a0km from Pisagua) to give up his part of the counterattack and return to Arica.\nThe Chileans meanwhile marched towards Iquique and, on November 19, 1879, defeated the Allied troops without Daza's men gathered in Agua Santa in the Battle of San Francisco and Dolores. Disbanded Bolivian forces there and the southern force retreated to Oruro, and the Peruvians fell back to Tiliviche. The Chilean army captured Iquique (80\u00a0km/50\u00a0mi south of Pisagua) without resistance. Some of the Peruvian forces that had been defeated at San Francisco retreated on Tarapac\u00e1, a little town with same name as the province, where they combined with Peruvian troops who withdrew to Tarapac\u00e1 directly from Iquique.\nA detachment of Chilean soldiers, with cavalry and artillery, was sent to face the Peruvian forces in Tarapac\u00e1. Both sides clashed on November 27 in the Battle of Tarapac\u00e1, and the Chilean forces were defeated, but the Peruvian forces, without lines of communication with their supply bases in Peru or Bolivia, could not maintain their occupation of the territory. Consequently, the Peruvians retreated north through harsh desert terrain to Arica and lost many troops during their withdrawal.[113] Bruce W. Farcau comments that, \"The province of Tarapac\u00e1 was lost along with a population of 200,000, nearly one tenth of the Peruvian total, and an annual gross income of \u00a328 million in nitrate production, virtually all of the country's export earnings.\"[114] The victory afforded Santiago an economic boon and a potential diplomatic asset.[115]\nThe Rimac\u2019s capture, the sinking of the Esmeralda, and the passiveness of the Chilean fleet showed that the command of the navy was unprepared for the war, and the army also had trouble with the logistics, medical service, and command. Public discontent with poor decisions led to riots, and the government had to replace the \"sclerotics\"[97] chief of the navy Juan Williams Rebolledo (by Galvarino Riveros), and the Chief of the army Justo Arteaga (by Erasmo Escala). After Tarapac\u00e1, the army was reorganized into divisions.\nChile's foreign policy tried to separate Bolivia from Peru. Gonzalo Bulnes writes: \"The target of the pol\u00edtica boliviana was the same as before, to seize Tacna and Arica for Bolivia and put Bolivia as a buffer state between Peru and Chile, on the assumption that Peru would accept the Chilean peace conditions. The initiated called such policy 'to clear up Bolivia.'\"[116] Moreover, the Chilean government had to find a border agreement with Argentina to avoid war.\nAfter the occupation of the salpeter and guano deposits, the Chilean government restituted the oficinas salitreras, which had been nationalized by Peru, to the owner of the certificate of debt.[117] The alternative of a Chilean State Company of Salpeter was discarded as too onerous for a government waging war and lacking experienced personnel, and the creditors pressed the issue. In 1879, Chile began to exact a tax of 40 cents per \"quintal m\u00e9trico\" (100\u00a0kg), increasing to $1.60 in 1880.[118]\nAs provided by the secret treaty, the allies agreed in the Protocol of Subsidies for Bolivia to bear the costs of the war. The agreement, which regulated the tax income for many years, caused resentments and fears in Bolivia, whose deployment of forces to Tacna was seen as helping Peru. Also, Bolivia knew that its army would be sent not to free the occupied region of Bolivia but to protect Peru. As Daza and his officers came to Tacna and Arica, they failed to see the expected Peruvian military strength and understood that their position of power in Bolivia was threatened by a defeat of the Allies. The Bolivian historian Querejazu suggests that Daza successfully used the Chilean offer of Tacna and Arica for Bolivia to exert pressure on Peru to get a more favorable Protocol of Subsidies.\nThe reason that Daza abandoned the Peruvian forces in Iquique and turned back to Arica just before the Battle of San Francisco is uncertain. Some historians say that he wanted to keep the \"Regimiento Colorados\" untouched since the force secured his political power in Bolivia. Daza later stated that his officers refused to continue the march through the desert, but his shameful withdrawal accelerated his downfall, and he was succeeded by Narciso Campero. In the new government, there was a strong tendency to accept the Chilean offer of Tacna and Arica, but it was eventually refused. Bolivia signed the creation of the United States of Peru and Bolivia, a political fantasy without any practical consequences. Bolivia helped Peru with money and weapons, but the Bolivian army never again intervened in the war.\nIn Peru, the political situation was complicated. President Prado had declared war on Chile for longstanding economical and political reasons[60] but without the funds or international credit to finance the war. He turned over the administration of the state to Vice President Luis La Puerta de Mendoza to assume for himself the command of the army. Because of the Chilean blockade, Peru could not export revenuemaking goods via its ports. As a consequence, public revenue was half of what had been expected, and spending tripled. The Peruvian government in 1879 experienced several political crises and seven ministers of finance. General Buend\u00eda, who led the defeated allied troops in Iquique, and More, chief of the sunken warship Independence, were both put on trial but were eventually acquitted.\nThe Peruvian government was confronted with widespread rioting in Lima because of its failures.[119] On December 18, 1879, as the fall of Iquique became known in Peru, Prado went from Callao to Panama, allegedly with the duty to oversee the purchase of new arms and warships for the nation. In a statement for the Peruvian newspaper El Comercio, he turned over the command of the country to Vice President Luis La Puerta de Mendoza. History has condemned his departure as a desertion.[120]:\u200a27\u200a Nicol\u00e1s de Pi\u00e9rola overthrew Puerta's government and took power on December 23, 1879.[121]\nPi\u00e9rola has been criticised because of his sectarianism, frivolous investment, bombastic decrees, and lack of control in the budget, but it must be said that he put forth an enormous effort to obtain new funds and to mobilize the country for the war. Basadre considered his work an act of heroism, abnegation in a country invaded, politically divided, militarily battered, and economically bloodless.[122]\nMeanwhile, Chile continued its advances in the Tacna and Arica Campaign. On November 28, ten days after the Battle of San Francisco, Chile declared the formal blockade of Arica. On December 31, a Chilean force of 600 men carried out an amphibious raid at Ilo as a reconnaissance in force, to the north of Tacna and withdrew the same day.[125]\nOn February 24, 1880, approximately 11,000 men in 19 ships, protected by Blanco Encalada, Toro, and Magallanes and two torpedo boats, sailed from Pisagua. Two days later, on February 26, the Chileans arrived off Punta Coles, near Pacocha, Ilo. The landing took several days to conclude but faced no resistance. The Peruvian commander, Lizardo Montero, refused to try to drive the Chileans from the beachhead, as the Chileans had expected.[126] On March 22, 3,642 Chilean troops defeated 1,300 Peruvian troops in the Battle of Los \u00c1ngeles, cutting any direct Peruvian supply from Lima to Arica or Tacna (supply was possible only through the long way, via Bolivia).[127] After the Battle of Los \u00c1ngeles, only three allied positions remained in southern Peru: General Leyva's 2nd Army at Arequipa (including some survivors from Los \u00c1ngeles), Bolognesi's 7th and 8th Divisions at Arica, and at Tacna the 1st Army. These forces were under Campero's direct command.[128] However, the numbers proved meaningless, as the Peruvians were unable to concentrate troops or even to move from their garrisons.[129][130] After crossing 40 miles (64\u00a0km) of desert, on May 26 the Chilean army (14,147 men[131]) destroyed the allied army of 5,150 Bolivians and 8,500 Peruvians in the Battle of Tacna. The need for a port near the army to supply and reinforce the troops and to evacuate the wounded compelled the Chilean command to concentrate on the remaining Peruvian stronghold of Arica. On June 7, after the Battle of Arica, the last Peruvian bastion in the Tacna Department fell. After the campaign of Tacna and Arica, the Peruvian and Bolivian regular armies largely ceased to exist,[132] and Bolivia effectively left the war.[133]\nOn October 22, 1880, delegates of Peru, Chile, and Bolivia held a 5-day conference aboard the USS\u00a0Lackawanna in Arica. The meeting had been arranged by the United States Ministers Plenipotentiary in the belligerent countries.[134] The Lackawanna Conference, also called the Arica Conference, attempted to develop a peace settlement.\nChile demanded Peruvian Tarapac\u00e1 Province and the Bolivian Atacama, an indemnity of 20,000,000 gold pesos, the restoration of property taken from Chilean citizens, the return of the Rimac, the abrogation of the treaty between Peru and Bolivia, and a formal commitment by not to mount artillery batteries in Arica's harbor. Arica, as a settlement, was to be limited to commercial use. Chile planned to retain the territories of Moquegua, Tacna, and Arica until all peace treaty conditions were satisfied. Although willing to accept the negotiated settlement, Peru and Bolivia insisted for Chile to withdraw its forces from all occupied lands as a precondition for discussing peace. Having captured the territory at great expense, Chile declined, and the negotiations failed. Bruce St. John states in Foreign Policy of Peru (page 116), \"Peru attended only out of deference to the [US government] latter, hoping a failure of the talks might lead to more aggressive US involvement.\"\nThe occupation of the southern departments of Peru (Tacna, Arica, and Tarapac\u00e1) and the Lynch expedition showed that the army of Peru no longer possessed the skilled military manpower to defend the country. However, nothing could convince the Peruvian government to sue for peace. The defeated allies failed to realize their situation and, despite the empty Bolivian treasury, on June 16, 1880, the Bolivian National Assembly voted to continue the war. On June 11, 1880, a document was signed in Peru declaring the creation of the United States of Peru-Bolivia,[135] but Pi\u00e9rola continued the struggle. W. Sater states, \"Had Pi\u00e9rola sued for peace in June 1880, he would have saved countless Peruvian lives and the nation's treasure.\"[136]\nThe Chilean government struggled to satisfy the public demands to end the war and to secure the peace. The situation forced the Chilean government to plan the occupation of Lima.[137]\nOnce the size of the Chilean army had been increased by 20,000 men to reach a strength of 41,000[6] soldiers, deployed from the forts of the Chile\u2013Mapuche frontier to the outskirts of Lima,[6] the Chilean army began the campaign of Lima. Lacking the ships to transport all the troops at once from Arica, the Chileans decided to land a division and then the rest of the army in stages. Their shortage of shipping also precluded an immediate landing at Lima. Instead, Pisco, approximately 320 kilometres (200\u00a0mi) south of Lima, was the first landing point.\nOn November 19, 8,800 men, twenty cannons and their supplies reached Pisco. A party of 400 men was landed near the port and they learned that a garrison of 3,000 men defended Pisco. Bypassing it required a landing to be made directly into the port and so a Chilean vanguard was landed in Paracas, ten miles to the south. The force managed to capture Pisco and on November 20 the rest of the Chilean troops landed, later occupying various other nearby coastal cities, securing for the Chileans de facto control of the Peruvian province of Ica.\nOn December 2, 3,500 additional men and 416 horses disembarked in Pisco. Some two weeks later, on December 15, 14,000 Chilean men, 2,400 horses and mules, and supplies left Arica for the north. Baquedano, the Chilean commander, decided that only one brigade in the Pisco region, Lynch's brigade, would march the 55 miles (89\u00a0km) north to the coastal town of Chilca, a town only 45 kilometres (28\u00a0mi) from Lima. All other Chilean forces would be re-embarked in Pisco for naval transport to Chilca. The Chilean troops disembarked in Curayaco, slightly north of Chilca, on December 22, 1880. The artillery was later disembarked at Lur\u00edn, on the southern outskirts of Lima, as the Chilean army was able to advance quickly after landing.\nPi\u00e9rola, who had expected a landing north of Lima, ordered the construction of two parallel lines of Peruvian defences, one at Chorrillos and one at Miraflores. It was hoped that the Peruvian professional Army would defeat the Chileans in Chorrillos. If that measure failed, a reserve army, increased with remnants of Chorrillos and the Callao troops, were expected to hold the Chilean advance at Miraflores. The Peruvian forces numbered approximately 25,000 to 32,000 men and were titled the Army of Lima.[138]\nThe main Peruvian defense line ran from the seaside resort of Chorrillos through Morro Solar, Santa Teresa, San Juan, the Pamplona (hills) until Monterrico Chico, a line of defence approximately 15\u00a0km long. Gatling guns, artillery, covering forts and trenches located along the top of the steeply natural hills (280 m in Morro Solar, 170 m in Sta. Teresa and San Juan[139]:\u200a253\u200a) and minefields around the roads to Lima crossing the hamlets of San Juan and Santa Teresa, settlements that the Peruvians anticipated would be important targets of the Chilean attack, all of which were used by the Peruvian military.\nThe second line of defense was less strong, consisting of 7 redoubts (one every 800 meters) for infantry and artillery, which the Peruvians hoped would stop any Chilean offensive.\nThe Chilean General Staff had two plans for the attack. Baquedano, the army chief, advocated a direct and frontal advance through the Tablada de Lur\u00edn. The area was known, with large areas of relatively flat terrain against the line of Chorrillos. The advantages of that path of advance were the shorter distances to be covered, a withdrawal line, the possibility of support from the Chilean navy, water supply from Lur\u00edn, and less need to train troops and the complex Chilean discipline to control any advance and subsequent attack. The alternative plan of War Minister Jos\u00e9 Francisco Vergara laid down a turning movement that would bypass the Peruvian line by attacking from further to the east: through the Lur\u00edn valley, moving via Chantay and reaching Lima at Ate. Using that approach meant that Lima could be seized without resistance or both defense lines could be attacked from the rear.\nVergara's plan avoided the bloody frontal attack, circumvented all defense works, cut any Peruvian withdrawal line to the east into the formidable Andes, and demoralized the Peruvians. However, there were no steady roads for movement of Chilean artillery and baggage, no water to allow navy support, and many bottlenecks in which a small force might stop the whole Chilean army on the way to Lima or if it had to withdraw. In addition, Vergara's plan required a well-trained and disciplined army. Baquedano pushed and eventually succeeded in having his plan adopted.\nIn the afternoon of January 12, 1881, three Chilean formations (referred to as divisions) stepped off from Lur\u00edn toward Chorrillos at about 4:00, reaching their attack positions at around 3:00 the next morning. At 5:00\u00a0a.m. an assault was begun on the Peruvian forts. Lynch's division charged Iglesias's positions (Morro Solar to Santa Teresa), Sotomayor's men against Caceres's sector (Santa Teresa to San Juan) and Lagos's division charged Davila's sector (San Juan to Monterrico Chico). Chilean and Peruvian soldiers locked in hand-to-hand combat and attacked one another with rifles, bayonets, rocks and even their bare hands. At the beginning, Sotomayor was unable to deploy in time, and Lynch's advance was repulsed. Baquedano was forced to throw in reserve brigades to salvage Lynch's flank. At 8:00\u00a0a.m., the Peruvian defenders were forced to withdraw from San Juan and Santa Teresa to Morro Solar and Chorrillos (town). At noon, Morro Solar was captured and the battle continued into Chorrillos, which fell at 14:00 (2 p.m.). During the Battle of Chorrillos, the Chileans inflicted a harsh defeat on the regular Peruvian forces, eliminating Lima's first defensive line. Two days later, the second line of defense was also penetrated in the Battle of Miraflores.\nPi\u00e9rola's division of forces in two lines has been criticised by Chilean analyst Francisco Machuca.[139]:\u200a361\u200a Whether such criticism is justified is debatable. According to Gonzalo Bulnes the battles of Chorrillos and Miraflores have been some of the largest in South America regarding the number of combatants, 45,000 in Chorrillos and 25,000 in Miraflores. The estimated death toll was 11,000 to 14,000 personnel, with a further 10,144 injured.[140]\nOn June 15, 1881 Domingo Santa Mar\u00eda was elected president of Chile and assumed office on September 18, 1881. A new Congress was elected on schedule in 1882.[141]\nArgentina had declared itself neutral at the onset of the war but allowed the transport of weapons to the Allies over Argentine territories, exerted influence on the US and European powers to stop the Chilean advance in the war, and pleaded for monetary indemnification instead of cession of territories to Chile. There was a strong drift in its public opinion in favor of Peru and Bolivia. Moreover, there were Peruvian and Bolivian hopes that Argentina could change its stance and enter a war against Chile.[142][143]\nOn July 23, 1881, a few months after the fall of Lima, Chile and Argentina signed the Boundary Treaty, which ceded eastern Patagonia to Argentina and control over the Strait of Magellan to Chile.\nCarlos Escud\u00e9 and Andr\u00e9s Cisneros state that the treaty was a true victory for Argentina,[142] but Michael Morris believes,[144] \"Rearguard Argentine efforts had been made to gain recognition for some kind of shared management regime for the Strait [of Magellan], in order to mitigate what was perceived as the striking diplomatic defeat for Argentina in the 1881 treaty granting Chile control over the strait.\"\nThe situation in Bolivia stayed the same after the fall of Lima. The Bolivian government lacked the money, men, weapons, and means to transport an army to Peru.[86]:\u200a115\nAfter the confrontations in Chorrillos and Miraflores, the Peruvian dictator Pi\u00e9rola refused to negotiate with the Chileans and escaped to the central Andes to try governing from the rear but soon lost the representation of the Peruvian state.[145](He left Peru in December 1881).\nThe occupation commanders, Manuel Baquedano, Pedro Lagos, and then Patricio Lynch, had their respective military headquarters in the Government Palace, Lima. The new Chilean administration continued to push for an end to the costly war, but contrary to expectations, neither Lima's capture nor the imposition of heavy taxes led Peru to sue for peace.[146] Conversely, Peruvian caudillos advocated to wage a defensive war of attrition that consumed Chile's power so much that it renounced their demand for the territory.\nOn February 22, 1881, the Pi\u00e9rola Congress, allowed by Chile, reinstated the 1860 constitution and chose Francisco Garc\u00eda Calder\u00f3n as the provisional president[147] but he was assisted by the US minister in Lima in refusing the cession of territories to Chile. He was overthrown by the Chileans in September 1881, but before his relegation to Chile, he had appointed Lizardo Montero Flores as successor.[148]\nThe Peruvian caudillos organized a resistance, which would be known as the Campaign of the Bre\u00f1a or Sierra, a widespread, prolonged, brutal, and eventually futile guerrilla campaign.[149] They harassed the Chilean troops and their logistics to such a point that Lynch had to send expeditions to the valleys in the Andes.\nThe resistance was organised by Andr\u00e9s Avelino C\u00e1ceres in the regions Cajamarca (north), Arequipa (south) and the Sierra Central (Cerro Pasco to Ayacucho)[150] However, the collapse of national order in Peru brought on also domestic chaos and violence, most of which was motivated by class or racial divisions. Chinese and black laborers took the opportunity to assault haciendas and the property of the rich to protest their mistreatment suffered in previous years. Lima's masses attacked Chinese grocery stores, and Indian peasants took over highland haciendas.[99]:\u200a390-\u200a For the occupation forces, the region was an unknown, difficult terrain, force inhibitor, insalubrious (tunga penetrans, dysentery),[151] inaccessible, and Chilean military supplies had to be transported from Lima or other points on the coast, purchased from locals, or confiscated, each option being either very expensive or politically hazardous.\nAn additional problem for the Chileans was collecting information in support of their expeditionary force. While C\u00e1ceres was informed about the dispositions and moves of his foes, Chileans often did not know the whereabouts of the guerrillas.\nIn February 1881, Chilean forces, under Lieutenant Colonel Ambrosio Letelier started the first expedition into the Sierra, with 700 men, to defeat the last guerrilla bands from Hu\u00e1nuco (April 30) to Jun\u00edn. After many losses, the expedition achieved very little and returned to Lima in early July,[152] where Letelier and his officers were courts-martialed for diverting money into their own pockets.[153]\nTo annihilate the guerrillas in the Mantaro Valley, in January 1882, Lynch ordered an offensive with 5,000 men[154] under the command of Gana and Del Canto, first towards Tarma and then southeast towards Huancayo, reaching Izcuchaca. Lynch's army suffered enormous hardships including cold temperatures, snow and mountain sickness. On July 9, 1882, they fought the emblematic Battle of La Concepci\u00f3n. The Chileans had to pull back with a loss of 534 soldiers: 154 in combat, 277 of disease and 103 deserters.\nGarc\u00eda Calder\u00f3n refused to relinquish Peruvian control over the Tarapac\u00e1 Region and so was arrested. Before Garc\u00eda Calder\u00f3n left Peru for Chile, he named Admiral Lizardo Montero as his successor. At the same time, Pi\u00e9rola stepped back and supported C\u00e1ceres for the presidency. C\u00e1ceres refused to serve but supported Lizardo Montero. Montero moved to Arequipa and so Garc\u00eda Calder\u00f3n's arrest unified the forces of Pi\u00e9rola and C\u00e1ceres.[155]\nOn April 1, 1882 Miguel Iglesias, Defence Minister under Pi\u00e9rola, became convinced that the war had to be brought to an end or Peru would be completely devastated. He issued a manifesto, es:Grito de Mont\u00e1n,[156] calling for peace and in December 1882 convened a convention of representatives of the seven northern departments, where he was elected \"Regenerating President\"[157][158] To support Iglesias against Montero, on April 6, 1883, Patricio Lynch started a new offensive to drive the guerrillas from central Peru and to destroy Caceres's army. The Chilean troops pursued Caceres northwest through narrow mountain passes until July 10, 1883, winning the definitive Battle of Huamachuco, the final Peruvian defeat.[159][160]\nChile and Iglesias's government signed the Peace Treaty of Anc\u00f3n on October 20, 1883, which ended the war and ceded Tarapac\u00e1 to Chile.\nLizardo Montero tried to resist in Arequipa with a force of 4,000 men, but when Chile's 3,000 fighters arrived from Mollendo, Moquegua, and Ayacucho and began the assault to Arequipa, the Peruvian troops mutinied against Montero and allowed the Chileans to occupy the city on October 29, 1883. Montero opted for a Bolivian asylum. The occupation of Ayacucho by Chilean Colonel Urriola on October 1 lasted only 40 days, as Urriola withdrew to Lima. Ayacucho was occupied by C\u00e1ceres's new army of 500 men. Caceres continued to refuse the cession of territories to Chile.[162]\nThe basis of C\u00e1ceres's war the increasingly powerful Indian insurrection against the Chileans, which had changed the nature of the war. Indian guerrillas fought \"white men from all parties,\" looted towns, and seized land of the white owners.[163] In June 1884, C\u00e1ceres accepted Treaty of Anc\u00f3n \"as an accomplished fact\" but continued to fight Iglesias.\nOn C\u00e1ceres's true reasons for his change of mind, Florencia Mallon wrote:[164]\nOn October 29, 1883, the Chilean occupation of Lima ended, and on August 4, 1884, Lynch and the rest of the Chilean Expeditionary Forces embarked in Callao for Chile.[165]:\u200a473\nOn October 20, 1883, hostilities between Chile and Peru formally came to an end under the Treaty of Anc\u00f3n, whose terms had Peru formally cede Tarapac\u00e1 Province to Chile, and the use of the guano and nitrate resources to repay Peru's debts were regulated. Chile was also to occupy the provinces of Tacna and Arica for 10 years, when a plebiscite was to be held to determine nationality. For decades thereafter, the two countries failed to agree on the terms of the plebiscite. Finally, in 1929, mediation under US President Herbert Hoover caused the Treaty of Lima to be signed by which Chile kept Arica, and Peru reacquired Tacna.\nIn 1884, Bolivia signed a truce, the Treaty of Valparaiso and accepted the military occupation of the entire Bolivian coast. The Treaty of Peace and Friendship (1904) ceded the complete region of Antofagasta to Chile. In return, Chile agreed to build the Arica\u2013La Paz railway to connect the capital city of La Paz, Bolivia, with the port of Arica, and Chile guaranteed freedom of transit for Bolivian commerce through Chilean ports and territory.\nAs the war began, the Peruvian Army numbered 5,241 men of all ranks, organized in seven infantry battalions, three squadrons of cavalry and two regiments of artillery.[166] The most common rifles in the army were the French Chassepot and the Mini\u00e9 rifles. The artillery, with a total of 28 pieces, was composed mostly of British-made Blakely cannons and counted four machine guns. Much of the artillery dated from 1866 and had been bought for the Chincha Islands War against Spain.[167] The mounts used by the cavalry were small and inferior to those used by the Chileans.[167]\nThe Bolivian Army numbered no more than 2,175 soldiers and was divided into three infantry regiments, two cavalry squadrons, and two sections of artillery.[94] The Colorados Battalion, President Daza's personal guard, was armed with Remington Rolling Block rifles, but the remainder carried odds and ends including flintlock muskets. The artillery had rifled three pounders and four machine guns, and the cavalry rode mules given a shortage of good horses.[167]\nThe regular Chilean Army was well equipped,[168][169][170][171] with 2,694 soldiers. The regular infantry was armed with the modern Belgian Comblain rifle, of which Chile had a stock of some 13,000. Chile also had Gras, Mini\u00e9, Remington and Beaumont rifles, most of which fired the same caliber cartridge (11\u00a0mm). The artillery had 75 artillery pieces, most of which were of Krupp and Limache manufacture, and six machine guns. The cavalry used French sabers and Spencer and Winchester carbines.[172]\nControl of the sea was Chile's key to an inevitably difficult desert war: supply by sea, including water, food, ammunition, horses, fodder, and reinforcements, was quicker and easier than marching supplies through the desert or across the Bolivian high plateau. While the Chilean Navy started an economic and military blockade of the Allies' ports, Peru took the initiative and used its smaller navy as a raiding force. The raids delayed the ground invasion for six months and forced Chile to shift its fleet from blockading to hunting and capturing the Hu\u00e1scar. After achieving naval supremacy, sea-mobile forces proved to be an advantage for desert warfare on the long coastline. Peruvian and Bolivian defenders found themselves hundreds of kilometers from home, but the Chilean forces were usually just a few kilometers from the sea.\nThe Chileans employed an early form of amphibious warfare, which saw the co-ordination of army, navy, and specialized units. The first amphibious assault of the war took place when 2,100 Chilean troops took Pisagua on November 2, 1879. Chilean Navy ships bombarded beach defenses for several hours at dawn, followed by open, oared boats landing army infantry and sapper units into waist-deep water under enemy fire. An outnumbered first landing wave fought at the beach; the second and third waves in the following hours were able to overcome resistance and move inland. By the end of the day, an expeditionary army of 10,000 had disembarked at the captured port. In 1881 Chilean ships transported approximately 30,000 men, along with their mounts and equipment, 500 miles (800\u00a0km) in order to attack Lima.[173] Chilean commanders were using purpose-built, flat-bottomed landing craft that would deliver troops in shallow water closer to the beach, possibly the first purpose-built amphibious landing craft in history:[174] \"These 36 shallow draft, flat-bottomed boats would be able to land three thousand men and twelve guns in a single wave.\"\nChile's military strategy emphasized preemption, offensive action, and combined arms. It was the first to mobilize and deploy its forces and took the war immediately to Bolivian and Peruvian territories. It adopted combined arms strategy that used naval and ground forces to rout its allied foes and capture enemy territory.[10]:\u200a163\u200a It landed ground forces in enemy territory to raid in strength to split and to drive out defenders, and it then garrisoned the territory as the fighting moved north. Chileans received the support of the Chinese coolies immigrants, who had been enslaved by Peruvians and joined the Chilean Army[175] during the campaign of Lima and in the raids to the north Peruvian cities.\nPeru and Bolivia fought a defensive war, maneuvering through long overland distances and relied when possible on land or coastal fortifications with gun batteries and minefields. Coastal railways reached to central Peru, and telegraph lines provided a direct line to the government in Lima.\nThe occupation of Peru from 1881 and 1884 took a different form. The theater was the Peruvian Sierra, where the remains of the Peruvian Army had easy access to the population, resource, and supply centers far from the sea, which supported indefinite attrition warfare. The occupying Chilean force was split into small garrisons across the theater and could devote only part of its strength to hunting down dispersed pockets of resistance and the last Peruvian forces in the Sierra. After a costly occupation and prolonged counterinsurgency campaign, Chile sought a diplomatic exit. Rifts within Peruvian society and Peruvian defeat in the Battle of Huamachuco resulted in the peace treaty that ended the occupation.\nBoth sides used late 19th-century military technology, such as breech-loading rifles and cannons, remote-controlled land mines, armor-piercing shells, naval torpedoes, torpedo boats, and purpose-built landing craft. The second generation of ironclads, designed after the Battle of Hampton Roads, were used in battle for the first time. That was significant for a conflict in which no major power was involved and attracted British, French, and US observers. During the war, Peru developed the Toro Submarino (\"Submarine Bull\"), which never saw action and was scuttled at the end to prevent capture.\nThe USS Wachusett (1861) commanded by Alfred Thayer Mahan, was stationed at Callao, Peru, to protect American interests during the war's final stages. Mahan formulated his concept of sea power while he was reading history in a British gentlemen's club in Lima, Peru. The concept became the foundation for his celebrated The Influence of Sea Power upon History.[176][177]\nSince 1876, a submarine cable connected Valpara\u00edso and Lima.[178]:\u200a72\u200a At the beginning of the war, Antofagasta and Iquique were connected to the cable.[179] Both navies tried to take control of the cable or severed it according to its military and naval interests.[180]\nLima was not connected by cable to Panama, the southernmost post of the North American cable network. Valpara\u00edso had been connected to Buenos Aires by a cable over the Andes since July 26, 1872. Buenos Aires was connected via Uruguay and Brazil, to Portugal and Britain and, from there, to the US over a submarine cable.[178] It must be emphasized that La Paz, Bolivia's capital, was not connected by telegraph to the rest of the world. News coming from Tacna, Arica, and Antofagasta to La Paz had to be brought by foot or horse.[181] The alternative way was from Peruvian port Mollendo (Querejazu: Moliendo) by railroad to Puno and then by boat service to Chichilaya, at the Bolivian shore of Lake Titicaca. The last route to La Paz was by horse or foot. The only telegraph in Bolivia was in Tupiza, 606 kilometres (377\u00a0mi) south from La Paz, as the crow flies. Tupiza is at the border to Argentina and was connected to Buenos Aires via telegraph.[182]\nThe traditional transport for long distances were the steamships that connected Valpara\u00edso, Caldera, Antofagasta, Iquique, Arica, and Lima to the rest of the world.\nThe disruption of maritime trade routes and the unavailability of submarine telegraph cables from and in the war zone presented special problems for the press coverage of the war. On the other hand, the west coast was important for investors, farmers, manufacturers, and government officials because of their financial commitments. Hence, The Times of London and The New York Times covered the events of the war as much as possible, in spite of the absence of their own correspondents. Information was culled from government representatives in Europe and the US, merchant houses and Lloyd's of London, articles printed in the Panama Star and Herald, and Reuters.\nThe result was a mix of brief telegraphic dispatches a few days' old from cities with cable stations, along with lengthier but older reports carried by steamships to London or New York. For example, the Battle of Iquique occurred on May 21, but its first mention appeared in the May 30 edition of both The Times and The New York Times with an incorrect message. It was only on June 17 that The Times could provide a reasonably accurate version of the battle.[178]:\u200a72\u201374\nThe three nations claimed to adhere to the Geneva Red Cross Convention to protect the war wounded, prisoners, refugees, civilians, and other noncombatants.[184]\nAt the onset of the war, 30,000[185] Chileans were expelled from Peru (within 8 days) and Bolivia (within 10 days) and their property confiscated, most of them having to shelter in the camps, boats, and pontoons of the Peruvian ports until they were transported by ship to Antofagasta. It is calculated that 7,000[185] of the refugees from Peru enlisted in the Chilean battalions, and their resentfulness would later influence the war.[186] Peruvian and Bolivian residents in Chile were not expelled.[187]\nBoth sides complained that the other side had killed wounded soldiers after the battle and cited eyewitness accounts.[188][189]:\u200a8\nBesides the Peruvian-Chilean slaughter in the irregular war after the occupation of Lima, an ethnic and social conflict was simmering in Peru between the indigenous[190] peoples and (Chinese) coolies who had been enslaved by Peru's white criollo and mestizo upper class.[191][192] On July 2, 1884, the guerrillero Tom\u00e1s Laymes and three of his men were executed in Huancayo by Caceres's forces because of the atrocities and crimes committed by the guerrillas against the Peruvian inhabitants of the cities and hamlets.[190] In Ayacucho, indigenous peoples stood up against \"the whites,\" and in Chincha, the Afro-Peruvians banded together against their owners in the Haciendas of \"Lar\u00e1n,\" \"San Jos\u00e9,\" and \"Hoja Redonda\". Only the Peruvian army could forcibly suppress the revolt.[193]\nChinese coolies formed the battalion \"Vulcano\" within the Chilean Army. There were also interethnic tensions under blacks and coolies. For example, in Ca\u00f1ete, 2000 coolies from the Haciendas \"Montalb\u00e1n\" and \"Juan de Arona\" were massacred by blacks.[194][195]\nThe British historian B. Farcau stated: \"Contrary to the concept of the 'merchants of death,' the arms manufacturers of Europe and the United States conniving to keep alive the conflict, from which they had earned some welcome sales of their merchandise, the most influential foreign businessmen and their respective consuls and ambassadors were the traders in nitrate and the holders of the growing stacks of debts of all the belligerents. They were all aware that the only way they could hope to receive payment on their loans and earn the profits from the nitrate business was to see the war ended and trade resumed on a normal footing without legal disputes over ownership of the resources of the region hanging over their heads.\"[196]\nNonethelesses, belligerents were able to purchase torpedo boats, arms, and munitions abroad and to circumvent ambiguous neutrality laws, and firms like Baring Brothers in London were not averse to dealing with both Chile and Peru.[99]:\u200a129\u200a Arms were sold freely to any side that could pay for them but the British abstained from selling warships.[197] For example, in 1879 to 1880, Peru acquired weapons from the United States, Europe, Costa Rica, and Panama. Weapons offloaded on the Caribbean coast of Panama were sent overland to the Pacific coast by the isthmus railway. In the Pacific, a number of ships, including the Talism\u00e1n, Chalaco, Lime\u00f1a, Estrella, Enriqueta and Guadiana, transported the cargo to Peru. The trade was done with the consent of the president of the Sovereign State of Panam\u00e1, then part of Colombia. The Chilean consul in Panama persistently protested the trade by citing a Chile\u2013Colombia agreement of 1844 that prohibited Colombia from providing war supplies to Chile's enemies.[198]\nAfter the Chilean occupation of Arica, Tarapac\u00e1, and Antofagasta, the governments of Peru and Bolivia turned as their last hope to the United States to block the Chilean annexation of the occupied territories.[199]:\u200a41\u200a American diplomats were worried that European powers might be tempted to intervene in the Pacific. The Bolivian Minister in Washington offered US Secretary of State William Maxwell Evarts the prospects of lucrative guano and nitrate concessions to American investors in return for official protection of Bolivia's territorial integrity.[42]:\u200a131\u200a[199]:\u200a42\u200a Isaac P. Christiancy, US Minister in Peru, organized the USS Lackwanna Conference, which ultimately failed, as none of the belligerents was ready to negotiate. Earlier, Christiancy had written to the US that Peru should be annexed for ten years and then admitted in the Union to provide the United States with access to the rich markets of South America.[199]:\u200a42\nIn 1881, US President James Garfield took the oath of office, and the Anglophobic[200] Secretary of State James G. Blaine supported an assertive role for the US in the war,[199]:\u200a43\u200a ostensibly regarding the interests of promoting US ownership of nitrate and guano concessions.[42]:\u200a132\u200a Blaine argued that the South American republics \"are young sisters of this government\" and so he would not tolerate European intervention in South America. The groups \"Credit Industriel\" and \"Peruvian Company,\" representing European and American creditors, had guaranteed to the Peruvian provisional government of Francisco Garc\u00eda Calder\u00f3n to pay the Peruvian external debt and the reparations to Chile, but in return, the Peruvian government had to grant mining concessions in Tarapac\u00e1 to these corporations. With the acquiescence of Garc\u00eda Calder\u00f3n, both companies began to lobby in the United States for the territories to remain under Peruvian sovereignty. For example, the US \"Levi P. Morton, Bliss and Company\" would get a monopoly on the sales of Peruvian nitrate in the US.\nBeside the economic plans, Stephen A. Hurlbut, Christiancy's successor, had negotiated with Garc\u00eda Calder\u00f3n the cession to the US of a naval base in Chimbote and the railroads to the coal mines upcountry.[201] When it became known that Blaine's representative in Peru, Hurlbut, would personally profit from the settlement, it was clear he was complicating the peace process[202][203] The American attempts reinforced Garcia Calderon's refusal to discuss the matter of territorial cession. Blaine then dispatched William H. Trescot in a mission to Chile to establish that problems would be resolved through arbitration and that acts of war would not justify territorial seizures.[42]:\u200a132\u200a After the assassination of Garfield (July 2, 1881) and the accession of Chester A. Arthur to the US presidency, Blaine was replaced by Frederick Theodore Frelinghuysen as Secretary of State. Frelinghuysen thought that the US was in no position to back Blaine's policy and recalled the Trescot mission.\nKenneth D. Lehmann commented the US policy:\nRegarding a British intervention in the war, the British historian Victor Kiernan had stated: \"It should be emphasized that the Foreign Office never at any time contemplated any kind of active intervention.... It was especially scrupulous in seeing to it that no warships were smuggled out for sale to either side, for it was in mortal dread of another Alabama Award.\"[197] During the war, the British government embargoed four warships sold to Chile and Per\u00fa.[D]\nThe case of looting and war reparations done by Chilean occupation forces in Peru has caused controversy between historians. It is overlooked in Chile and a source of anti-Chilean sentiment in Peru. The Chilean historian Milton Godoy Orellana[205] distinguishes the looting after the battle of Chorrillos y Miraflores; the looting by Peruvians in Lima before the Chilean troops entered the city; and the Chilean destruction of locomotives, rails, printing machines, weapons, etc. The Chilean government tried to control it through the \"Oficina Recaudadora de las Contribuciones de Guerra,\" whose tasks were to inventory and realize the confiscation and to record and to confirm transport to Chile, the destination, and the sender. Allegedly, the strategic purposes were to obtain the peace. There is no general list of the looted goods, but many of the shipments were registered in private and official letters, newspaper articles, manifests, etc. Also, looting of cultural assets of Peru by the Chileans and Peruvians occurred; the development of international law regarding the protection of cultural objects evolved over the 19th and 20th centuries, but the idea of protecting cultural assets first emerged in Europe in the 18th century.[206]\nThe Lieber Code of 1863 unconditionally protected works of art during an armed conflict (Art. 35) but expressly consented to the use of cultural property as war reparations (Art. 36).[207] In fact, Sergio Villalobos states that in 1817, the US accepted the confiscation of art works but the 1874 Project of an International Declaration concerning the Laws and Customs of War asserted that the cultural assets were to be considered as protected.[208]\nIn March 1881, the Chilean government began to seize the Biblioteca Nacional del Per\u00fa, and 45,000 books were seized,[208] but some of the books were sold in Lima by Peruvians, and so it is contested how much of the booty was taken by the Chilean forces. In any case, in late March 1881, some of the books arrived to Chile, and the press began to inform and discuss about the legitimacy of looting oil paintings, books, statues, etc., or \"international robbery\", as a journalist of \"La Epoca\" described it.\nOn January 4, 1883, in a session of the Chilean Congress, the deputy Augusto Matte P\u00e9rez questioned Minister of the Interior Jos\u00e9 Manuel Balmaceda on the \"opprobrious and humiliating\" shipments of Peruvian cultural assets. Montt asked the devolution of the assets and was supported by deputies McClure and Puelma. The minister vowed to impede further exactions and to repatriate the objects mentioned in the discussion. Apparently, he did so since the shipments stopped, and the mentioned statues are not there anymore, but it was not until November 2007 that Chile returned 3,778 stolen books to the Biblioteca Nacional del Per\u00fa.[209] S. Villalobos asserted, \"There was no justification for the theft.\"[210]\nAnother issue was the damage from acts of war on properties owned by citizens of neutral countries. In 1884, the Tribunales Arbitrales were constituted with a Chilean judge, who was named by the country of the claimant, as well as a Brazilian judge to deal with the claims of citizens from Britain (118 claims), Italy (440 claims), and France (89 claims). A tribunal was established in 1886 for German citizens. The \"Italian\" tribunal also dealt with Belgian citizens, and the \"German\" tribunal acted for Austrian and Swiss citizens. Spaniards accepted the decision of the Chilean state without the tribunal's assistance and the US did not agree at the time.\nAccording to international law, animus manendi claims by foreign citizens could not be made unless the damaged property had been in an actual battleground (such as Arica, Chorrillos, and Miraflores, with Pisagua and Tacna being in a similar situation), but damages caused by individual or scattered soldiers were dismissed. Only 3.6% (1,080,562 Chilean pesos) of the value that was claimed was recognized by the tribunals. According to Villalobos, the verdicts proved that the accusations against the Chilean forces had been exaggerated by Peruvians because of their wounded pride and by foreign citizens because of monetary interests.[211]\nThe war had a profound and longlasting effect on the societies of all countries involved. The negotiations concerning territorial cessions continued until 1929, but the war ended in 1884 for all practical purposes.[212] Various authors have referred to the war as a trauma for Peru and Bolivia.[213]\nD\u00eda del Mar is celebrated in Bolivia on March 23, at the conclusion of the weeklong Semana del Mar with a ceremony at La Paz's Plaza Abaroa, in homage to war hero Eduardo Abaroa, and in parallel ceremonies nationwide.\nNaval Glories Day is a Chilean anniversary that commemorates two naval battles that occurred on Wednesday, May 21, 1879: that of Iquique, where captain of frigate Arturo Prat died along with the entire crew of the corvette Esmeralda, sunk by the Peruvian monitor Hu\u00e1scar (built in the United Kingdom for the Peruvian government in 1864, it served in the Peruvian Navy until it was captured by Chile in 1879) under the command of Captain Miguel Grau; and that of Punta Gruesa, where the schooner Covadonga, under the command of Carlos Condell, ran aground the Peruvian armored frigate Independencia, under the command of Juan Guillermo More, in the rocks of Punta Gruesa.\nEven though the 1873 treaty and the imposition of the 10 centavos tax proved to be the casus belli, there were deeper, more fundamental reasons for the outbreak of hostilities in 1879. On the one hand, there was the power, prestige, and relative stability of Chile compared to the economic deterioration and political discontinuity which characterised both Peru and Bolivia after independence. On the other, there was the ongoing competition for economic and political hegemony in the region, complicated by a deep antipathy between Peru and Chile. In this milieu, the vagueness of the boundaries between the three states, coupled with the discovery of valuable guano and nitrate deposits in the disputed territories, combined to produce a diplomatic conundrum of insurmountable proportions.[9]", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Pacific", " https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atacama_desert#bodyContent",
