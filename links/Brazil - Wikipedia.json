At 8.5\u00a0million square kilometers (3,300,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)[10] and with over 217 million people, Brazil is the world's fifth-largest country by area and the seventh most populous. Its capital is Bras\u00edlia, and its most populous city is S\u00e3o Paulo. The federation is composed of the union of the 26 states and the Federal District. It is the only country in the Americas to have Portuguese as an official language.[11][12] It is one of the most multicultural and ethnically diverse nations, due to over a century of mass immigration from around the world,[13] and the most populous Roman Catholic-majority country.\nBounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of 7,491 kilometers (4,655\u00a0mi).[14] It borders all other countries and territories in South America except Ecuador and Chile and covers roughly half of the continent's land area.[15] Its Amazon basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats.[14] This unique environmental heritage positions Brazil at number one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest, as environmental degradation through processes like deforestation has direct impacts on global issues like climate change and biodiversity loss.\nThe territory which would become known as Brazil was inhabited by numerous tribal nations prior to the landing in 1500 of explorer Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral, who claimed the discovered land for the Portuguese Empire. Brazil remained a Portuguese colony until 1808 when the capital of the empire was transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro. In 1815, the colony was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the formation of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. Independence was achieved in 1822 with the creation of the Empire of Brazil, a unitary state governed under a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary system. The ratification of the first constitution in 1824 led to the formation of a bicameral legislature, now called the National Congress. Slavery was abolished in 1888. The country became a presidential republic in 1889 following a military coup d'\u00e9tat. An authoritarian military junta came to power in 1964 and ruled until 1985, after which civilian governance resumed. Brazil's current constitution, formulated in 1988, defines it as a democratic federal republic.[16] Due to its rich culture and history, the country ranks thirteenth in the world by number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.[17]\nA major non-NATO ally of the United States, Brazil is a regional and middle power,[18][19][20] and is also classified as an emerging power.[21][22][23][24] Categorised as a developing country with a high Human Development Index,[25] Brazil is considered an advanced emerging economy,[26] having the twelfth largest GDP in the world by nominal, and ninth by PPP measures, the largest in Latin America.[27][28] As an upper-middle income economy by the World Bank[29] and a newly industrialized country,[30] Brazil has the largest share of global wealth in South America and it is one of the world's major breadbaskets, being the largest producer of coffee for the last 150 years.[31] However, the country retains noticeable corruption, crime and social inequality. Brazil is a founding member of the United Nations, the G20, BRICS, Mercosul, Organization of American States, Organization of Ibero-American States and the Community of Portuguese Language Countries.\nThe word \"Brazil\" likely comes from the Portuguese word for brazilwood, a tree that once grew plentifully along the Brazilian coast.[32] In Portuguese, brazilwood is called pau-brasil, with the word brasil commonly given the etymology \"red like an ember,\" formed from brasa (\"ember\") and the suffix -il (from -iculum or -ilium).[33] As brazilwood produces a deep red dye, it was highly valued by the European textile industry and was the earliest commercially exploited product from Brazil.[34] Throughout the 16th century, massive amounts of brazilwood were harvested by indigenous peoples (mostly Tupi) along the Brazilian coast, who sold the timber to European traders (mostly Portuguese, but also French) in return for assorted European consumer goods.[35]\nThe official Portuguese name of the land, in original Portuguese records, was the \"Land of the Holy Cross\" (Terra da Santa Cruz),[36] but European sailors and merchants commonly called it the \"Land of Brazil\" (Terra do Brasil) because of the brazilwood trade.[37] The popular appellation eclipsed and eventually supplanted the official Portuguese name. Some early sailors called it the \"Land of Parrots.\"[38]\nIn the Guaran\u00ed language, an official language of Paraguay, Brazil is called \"Pindorama\". This was the name the indigenous population gave to the region, meaning \"land of the palm trees.\"[39]\nSome of the earliest human remains found in the Americas, Luzia Woman, were found in the area of Pedro Leopoldo, Minas Gerais and provide evidence of human habitation going back at least 11,000 years.[41][42] \nThe earliest pottery ever found in the Western Hemisphere was excavated in the Amazon basin of Brazil and radiocarbon dated to 8,000 years ago (6000 BC). The pottery was found near Santar\u00e9m and provides evidence that the tropical forest region supported a complex prehistoric culture.[43] The Marajoara culture flourished on Maraj\u00f3 in the Amazon delta from AD 400 to 1400, developing sophisticated pottery, social stratification, large populations, mound building, and complex social formations such as chiefdoms.[44]\nAround the time of the Portuguese arrival, the territory of current day Brazil had an estimated indigenous population of 7 million people,[45] mostly semi-nomadic, who subsisted on hunting, fishing, gathering, and migrant agriculture. The indigenous population of Brazil comprised several large indigenous ethnic groups (e.g., the Tupis, Guaranis, G\u00eas, and Arawaks). The Tupi people were subdivided into the Tupiniquins and Tupinamb\u00e1s, and there were also many subdivisions of the other groups.[46]\nBefore the arrival of the Europeans, the boundaries between these groups and their subgroups were marked by wars that arose from differences in culture, language and moral beliefs.[47] These wars also involved large-scale military actions on land and water, with cannibalistic rituals on prisoners of war.[48][49] While heredity had some weight, leadership was a status more won over time than assigned in succession ceremonies and conventions.[47] Slavery among the indigenous groups had a different meaning than it had for Europeans, since it originated from a diverse socioeconomic organization, in which asymmetries were translated into kinship relations.[50]\nFollowing the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas, the land now called Brazil was claimed for the Portuguese Empire on 22 April 1500, with the arrival of the Portuguese fleet commanded by Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral.[52] The Portuguese encountered indigenous peoples divided into several ethnic societies, most of whom spoke languages of the Tupi\u2013Guarani family and fought among themselves.[53] Though the first settlement was founded in 1532, colonization effectively began in 1534, when King John\u00a0III of Portugal divided the territory into the fifteen private and autonomous captaincies.[54][55]\nHowever, the decentralized and unorganized tendencies of the captaincies proved problematic, and in 1549 the Portuguese king restructured them into the Governorate General of Brazil in the city of Salvador, which became the capital of a single and centralized Portuguese colony in South America.[55][56] In the first two centuries of colonization, Indigenous and European groups lived in constant war, establishing opportunistic alliances in order to gain advantages against each other.[57][58][59][60]\nBy the mid-16th century, cane sugar had become Brazil's most important export,[53][61] while slaves purchased in Sub-Saharan Africa in the slave market of Western Africa[62] (not only those from Portuguese allies of their colonies in Angola and Mozambique), had become its largest import,[63][64] to cope with sugarcane plantations, due to increasing international demand for Brazilian sugar.[65][66] Brazil received more than 2.8 million slaves from Africa between the years of 1500 to 1800.[67]\nBy the end of the 17th century, sugarcane exports began to decline[68] and the discovery of gold by bandeirantes in the 1690s would become the new backbone of the colony's economy, fostering a gold rush[69] which attracted thousands of new settlers to Brazil from Portugal and all Portuguese colonies around the world.[70] This increased level of immigration in turn caused some conflicts between newcomers and old settlers.[71]\nPortuguese expeditions known as bandeiras gradually expanded Brazil's original colonial frontiers in South America to its approximately current borders.[72][73] In this era other European powers tried to colonize parts of Brazil, in incursions that the Portuguese had to fight, notably the French in Rio during the 1560s, in Maranh\u00e3o during the 1610s, and the Dutch in Bahia and Pernambuco, during the Dutch\u2013Portuguese War, after the end of Iberian Union.[74]\nThe Portuguese colonial administration in Brazil had two objectives that would ensure colonial order and the monopoly of Portugal's wealthiest and largest colony: to keep under control and eradicate all forms of slave rebellion and resistance, such as the Quilombo of Palmares,[75] and to repress all movements for autonomy or independence, such as the Minas Gerais Conspiracy.[76]\nIn late 1807, Spanish and Napoleonic forces threatened the security of continental Portugal, causing Prince Regent John, in the name of Queen Maria I, to move the royal court from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro.[77] There they established some of Brazil's first financial institutions, such as its local stock exchanges[78] and its National Bank, additionally ending the Portuguese monopoly on Brazilian trade and opening Brazil's ports to other nations. In 1809, in retaliation for being forced into exile, the Prince Regent ordered the conquest of French Guiana.[79]\nWith the end of the Peninsular War in 1814, the courts of Europe demanded that Queen Maria I and Prince Regent John return to Portugal, deeming it unfit for the head of an ancient European monarchy to reside in a colony. In 1815, to justify continuing to live in Brazil, where the royal court had thrived for six years, the Crown established the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves, thus creating a pluricontinental transatlantic monarchic state.[80] However, the leadership in Portugal, resentful of the new status of its larger colony, continued to demand the return of the court to Lisbon (see Liberal Revolution of 1820). In 1821, acceding to the demands of revolutionaries who had taken the city of Porto,[81] John VI departed for Lisbon. There he swore an oath to the new constitution, leaving his son, Prince Pedro de Alc\u00e2ntara, as Regent of the Kingdom of Brazil.[82]\nTensions between Portuguese and Brazilians increased and the Portuguese Cortes, guided by the new political regime imposed by the Liberal Revolution, tried to re-establish Brazil as a colony.[83] The Brazilians refused to yield, and Prince Pedro decided to stand with them, declaring the country's independence from Portugal on 7 September 1822.[84] A month later, Prince Pedro was declared the first Emperor of Brazil, with the royal title of Dom Pedro\u00a0I, resulting in the founding of the Empire of Brazil.[85]\nThe Brazilian War of Independence, which had already begun along this process, spread through the northern, northeastern regions and in the Cisplatina province.[86] The last Portuguese soldiers surrendered on 8 March 1824;[87] Portugal officially recognized Brazilian independence on 29 August 1825.[88]\nOn 7 April 1831, worn down by years of administrative turmoil and political dissent with both liberal and conservative sides of politics, including an attempt of republican secession[89] and unreconciled to the way that absolutists in Portugal had given in the succession of King John VI, Pedro\u00a0I departed for Portugal to reclaim his daughter's crown after abdicating the Brazilian throne in favor of his five-year-old son and heir (who thus became the Empire's second monarch, with the royal title of Dom Pedro\u00a0II).[90]\nAs the new Emperor could not exert his constitutional powers until he came of age, a regency was set up by the National Assembly.[91] In the absence of a charismatic figure who could represent a moderate face of power, during this period a series of localized rebellions took place, such as the Cabanagem in Gr\u00e3o-Par\u00e1, the Mal\u00ea Revolt in Salvador, the Balaiada (Maranh\u00e3o), the Sabinada (Bahia), and the Ragamuffin War, which began in Rio Grande do Sul and was supported by Giuseppe Garibaldi. These emerged from the provinces' dissatisfaction with the central power, coupled with old and latent social tensions peculiar to a vast, slaveholding and newly independent nation state.[92] This period of internal political and social upheaval, which included the Praieira revolt in Pernambuco, was overcome only at the end of the 1840s, years after the end of the regency, which occurred with the premature coronation of Pedro II in 1841.[93]\nDuring the last phase of the monarchy, internal political debate centered on the issue of slavery. The Atlantic slave trade was abandoned in 1850,[94] as a result of the British Aberdeen Act and the Eus\u00e9bio de Queir\u00f3s Law, but only in May 1888, after a long process of internal mobilization and debate for an ethical and legal dismantling of slavery in the country, was the institution formally abolished with the approval of the Golden Law.[95]\nThe foreign-affairs policies of the monarchy dealt with issues with the countries of the Southern Cone with whom Brazil had borders. Long after the Cisplatine War that resulted in the independence of Uruguay,[96] Brazil won three international wars during the 58-year reign of Pedro\u00a0II. These were the Platine War, the Uruguayan War and the devastating Paraguayan War, the largest war effort in Brazilian history.[97][98]\nAlthough there was no desire among the majority of Brazilians to change the country's form of government,[99] on 15 November 1889, in disagreement with the majority of the Imperial Army officers, as well as with rural and financial elites (for different reasons), the monarchy was overthrown by a military coup.[100] A few days later, the national flag was replaced with a new design that included the national motto \"Ordem e Progresso\", influenced by positivism. 15 November is now Republic Day, a national holiday.[101]\nThe early republican government was a military dictatorship, with the army dominating affairs both in Rio de Janeiro and in the states. Freedom of the press disappeared and elections were controlled by those in power.[102] Not until 1894, following an economic crisis and a military one, did civilians take power, remaining there until October 1930.[103][104][105]\nIf in relation to its foreign policy, the country in this first republican period maintained a relative balance characterized by a success in resolving border disputes with neighboring countries,[106] only broken by the Acre War (1899\u20131902) and its involvement in World War I (1914\u20131918),[107][108][109] followed by a failed attempt to exert a prominent role in the League of Nations;[110] Internally, from the crisis of Encilhamento[111][112][113] and the Navy Revolts,[114] a prolonged cycle of financial, political and social instability began until the 1920s, keeping the country besieged by various rebellions, both civilian[115][116][117] and military.[118][119][120]\nLittle by little, a cycle of general instability sparked by these crises undermined the regime to such an extent that in the wake of the murder of his running mate, the defeated opposition presidential candidate Get\u00falio Vargas, supported by most of the military, successfully led the Revolution of 1930.[121][122] Vargas and the military were supposed to assume power temporarily, but instead closed down Congress, extinguished the Constitution, ruled with emergency powers and replaced the states' governors with his own supporters.[123][124]\nIn the 1930s, three failed attempts to remove Vargas and his supporters from power occurred. The first was the Constitutionalist Revolution in 1932, led by the S\u00e3o Paulo's oligarchy. The second was a Communist uprising in November 1935, and the last one a putsch attempt by local fascists in May 1938.[125][126][127] The 1935 uprising created a security crisis in which Congress transferred more power to the executive branch. The 1937 coup d'\u00e9tat resulted in the cancellation of the 1938 election and formalized Vargas as dictator, beginning the Estado Novo era. During this period, government brutality and censorship of the press increased.[128]\nThroughout World War II, Brazil remained neutral until August 1942, when the country suffered retaliation by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy in a strategic dispute over the South Atlantic, and, therefore, entered the war on the allied side.[129][130][131] In addition to its participation in the battle of the Atlantic, Brazil also sent an expeditionary force to fight in the Italian campaign.[132]\nWith the Allied victory in 1945 and the end of the fascist regimes in Europe, Vargas's position became unsustainable and he was swiftly overthrown in another military coup, with democracy \"reinstated\" by the same army that had ended it 15 years earlier.[133] Vargas committed suicide in August 1954 amid a political crisis, after having returned to power by election in 1950.[134][135]\nSeveral brief interim governments followed Vargas's suicide.[136] Juscelino Kubitschek became president in 1956 and assumed a conciliatory posture towards the political opposition that allowed him to govern without major crises.[137] The economy and industrial sector grew remarkably,[138] but his greatest achievement was the construction of the new capital city of Bras\u00edlia, inaugurated in 1960.[139] Kubitschek's successor, J\u00e2nio Quadros, resigned in 1961 less than a year after taking office.[140] His vice-president, Jo\u00e3o Goulart, assumed the presidency, but aroused strong political opposition[141] and was deposed in April 1964 by a coup that resulted in a military dictatorship.[142]\nThe new regime was intended to be transitory[143] but gradually closed in on itself and became a full dictatorship with the promulgation of the Fifth Institutional Act in 1968.[144] Oppression was not limited to those who resorted to guerrilla tactics to fight the regime, but also reached institutional opponents, artists, journalists and other members of civil society,[145][146] inside and outside the country through the infamous \"Operation Condor\".[147][148] Like other brutal authoritarian regimes, due to an economic boom, known as the \"economic miracle\", the regime reached a peak in popularity in the early 1970s.[149] Slowly, however, the wear and tear of years of dictatorial power that had not slowed the repression, even after the defeat of the leftist guerrillas,[150] plus the inability to deal with the economic crises of the period and popular pressure, made an opening policy inevitable, which from the regime side was led by Generals Ernesto Geisel and Golbery do Couto e Silva.[151] With the enactment of the Amnesty Law in 1979, Brazil began a slow return to democracy, which was completed during the 1980s.[93]\nCivilians returned to power in 1985 when Jos\u00e9 Sarney assumed the presidency. He became unpopular during his tenure through failure to control the economic crisis and hyperinflation he inherited from the military regime.[152] Sarney's unsuccessful government led to the election in 1989 of the almost-unknown Fernando Collor, who was subsequently impeached by the National Congress in 1992.[153] Collor was succeeded by his vice-president, Itamar Franco, who appointed Fernando Henrique Cardoso Minister of Finance. In 1994, Cardoso produced a highly successful Plano Real,[154] that, after decades of failed economic plans made by previous governments attempting to curb hyperinflation, finally stabilized the Brazilian economy.[155][156] Cardoso won the 1994 election, and again in 1998.[157]\nThe peaceful transition of power from Cardoso to his main opposition leader, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva (elected in 2002 and re-elected in 2006), was seen as proof that Brazil had achieved a long-sought political stability.[158][159] However, sparked by indignation and frustrations accumulated over decades from corruption, police brutality, inefficiencies of the political establishment and public service, numerous peaceful protests erupted in Brazil from the middle of first term of Dilma Rousseff, who had succeeded Lula after winning election in 2010 and again in 2014 by narrow margins.[160][161]\nRousseff was impeached by the Brazilian Congress in 2016, halfway into her second term,[162][163] and replaced by her Vice-president Michel Temer, who assumed full presidential powers after Rousseff's impeachment was accepted on 31 August. Large street protests for and against her took place during the impeachment process.[164] The charges against her were fueled by political and economic crises along with evidence of involvement with politicians (from all the primary political parties) in several bribery and tax evasion schemes.[citation needed] In 2017, the Supreme Court requested the investigation of 71 Brazilian lawmakers and nine ministers of President Michel Temer's cabinet who were allegedly linked to the Petrobras corruption scandal.[165] President Temer himself was also accused of corruption.[166] According to a 2018 poll, 62% of the population said that corruption was Brazil's biggest problem.[167]\nIn the fiercely disputed 2018 elections, the controversial conservative candidate Jair Bolsonaro of the Social Liberal Party (PSL) was elected president, winning in the second round Fernando Haddad, of the Workers Party (PT), with the support of 55.13% of the valid votes.[168] In the early 2020s, Brazil became one of the hardest hit countries during the COVID-19 pandemic, receiving the second-highest death toll worldwide after the United States.[169] Experts have largely blamed the situation on the leadership of President Bolsonaro, who throughout the pandemic has repeatedly downplayed the threat of COVID-19 and dissuaded states and cities from enforcing quarantine measures, prioritizing the nation's economy.[169][170][171]\nBrazil occupies a large area along the eastern coast of South America and includes much of the continent's interior,[172] sharing land borders with Uruguay to the south; Argentina and Paraguay to the southwest; Bolivia and Peru to the west; Colombia to the northwest; and Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname and France (French overseas region of French Guiana) to the north. It shares a border with every South American country except Ecuador and Chile.[14]\nIt also encompasses a number of oceanic archipelagos, such as Fernando de Noronha, Rocas Atoll, Saint Peter and Paul Rocks, and Trindade and Martim Vaz.[14] Its size, relief, climate, and natural resources make Brazil geographically diverse.[172] Including its Atlantic islands, Brazil lies between latitudes 6\u00b0N and 34\u00b0S, and longitudes 28\u00b0 and 74\u00b0W.[14]\nBrazil is the fifth largest country in the world, and third largest in the Americas, with a total area of 8,515,767.049\u00a0km2 (3,287,956\u00a0sq\u00a0mi),[173] including 55,455\u00a0km2 (21,411\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of water. North to South, Brazil is also the longest country in the world, spanning 4,395\u00a0km (2,731\u00a0mi) from north to south,[14] and the only country in the world that has the equator and the Tropic of Capricorn running through it.[14]\nIt spans four time zones; from UTC\u22125 comprising the state of Acre and the westernmost portion of Amazonas, to UTC\u22124 in the western states, to UTC\u22123 in the eastern states (the national time) and UTC\u22122 in the Atlantic islands.[174]\nBrazilian topography is also diverse and includes hills, mountains, plains, highlands, and scrublands. Much of the terrain lies between 200 meters (660\u00a0ft) and 800 meters (2,600\u00a0ft) in elevation.[175] The main upland area occupies most of the southern half of the country.[175] The northwestern parts of the plateau consist of broad, rolling terrain broken by low, rounded hills.[175]\nThe southeastern section is more rugged, with a complex mass of ridges and mountain ranges reaching elevations of up to 1,200 meters (3,900\u00a0ft).[175] These ranges include the Mantiqueira and Espinha\u00e7o mountains and the Serra do Mar.[175] In the north, the Guiana Highlands form a major drainage divide, separating rivers that flow south into the Amazon Basin from rivers that empty into the Orinoco River system, in Venezuela, to the north. The highest point in Brazil is the Pico da Neblina at 2,994 meters (9,823\u00a0ft), and the lowest is the Atlantic Ocean.[14]\nBrazil has a dense and complex system of rivers, one of the world's most extensive, with eight major drainage basins, all of which drain into the Atlantic.[176] Major rivers include the Amazon (the world's second-longest river and the largest in terms of volume of water), the Paran\u00e1 and its major tributary the Igua\u00e7u (which includes the Iguazu Falls), the Negro, S\u00e3o Francisco, Xingu, Madeira and Tapaj\u00f3s rivers.[176]\nThe climate of Brazil comprises a wide range of weather conditions across a large area and varied topography, but most of the country is tropical.[14] According to the K\u00f6ppen system, Brazil hosts six major climatic subtypes: desert, equatorial, tropical, semiarid, oceanic and subtropical. The different climatic conditions produce environments ranging from equatorial rainforests in the north and semiarid deserts in the northeast, to temperate coniferous forests in the south and tropical savannas in central Brazil.[177] Many regions have starkly different microclimates.[178][179]\nAn equatorial climate characterizes much of northern Brazil. There is no real dry season, but there are some variations in the period of the year when most rain falls.[177] Temperatures average 25\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F),[179] with more significant temperature variation between night and day than between seasons.[178]\nOver central Brazil rainfall is more seasonal, characteristic of a savanna climate.[178] This region is as extensive as the Amazon basin but has a very different climate as it lies farther south at a higher altitude.[177] In the interior northeast, seasonal rainfall is even more extreme.[180]\nThe semiarid climatic region generally receives less than 800 millimeters (31.5\u00a0in) of rain,[180] most of which generally falls in a period of three to five months of the year[181] and occasionally less than this, creating long periods of drought.[178] Brazil's 1877\u201378 Grande Seca (Great Drought), the worst in Brazil's history,[182] caused approximately half a million deaths.[183] A similarly devastating drought occurred in 1915.[184]\nSouth of Bahia, near the coasts, and more southerly most of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, the distribution of rainfall changes, with rain falling throughout the year.[177] The south enjoys subtropical conditions, with cool winters and average annual temperatures not exceeding 18\u00a0\u00b0C (64.4\u00a0\u00b0F);[179] winter frosts and snowfall are not rare in the highest areas.[177][178]\nIn 2020 the government of Brazil pledged to reduce its annual greenhouse gases emissions by 43% by 2030. It also set as indicative target of reaching carbon neutrality by 2060 if the country gets 10 billion dollars per year.[185]\nThe wildlife of Brazil comprises all naturally occurring animals, plants, and fungi in the South American country. Home to 60% of the Amazon Rainforest, which accounts for approximately one-tenth of all                                                      \nspecies in the world,[186] Brazil is considered to have the greatest biodiversity of any country on the planet, containing over 70% of all animal and plant species catalogued.[187] It has the most known species of plants (55,000), freshwater fish (3,000), and mammals (over 689).[188] It also ranks third on the list of countries with the most bird species (1,832) and second with the most reptile species (744).[188] The number of fungal species is unknown but is large.[189] Brazil is second only to Indonesia as the country with the most endemic species.[190]\nBrazil's large territory comprises different ecosystems, such as the Amazon rainforest, recognized as having the greatest biological diversity in the world,[191] with the Atlantic Forest and the Cerrado, sustaining the greatest biodiversity.[192] In the south, the Araucaria moist forests grow under temperate conditions.[192] The rich wildlife of Brazil reflects the variety of natural habitats. Scientists estimate that the total number of plant and animal species in Brazil could approach four million, mostly invertebrates.[192] Larger mammals include carnivores pumas, jaguars, ocelots, rare bush dogs, and foxes, and herbivores peccaries, tapirs, anteaters, sloths, opossums, and armadillos. Deer are plentiful in the south, and many species of New World monkeys are found in the northern rain forests.[192][193]\nMore than one-fifth of the Amazon Rainforest in Brazil has been completely destroyed, and more than 70 mammals are endangered.[188] The threat of extinction comes from several sources, including deforestation and poaching. Extinction is even more problematic in the Atlantic Forest, where nearly 93% of the forest has been cleared.[196] Of the 202 endangered animals in Brazil, 171 are in the Atlantic Forest.[197] The Amazon rainforest has been under direct threat of deforestation since the 1970s because of rapid economic and demographic expansion. Extensive legal and illegal logging destroy forests the size of a small country per year, and with it a diverse series of species through habitat destruction and habitat fragmentation.[198] Since 1970, over 600,000 square kilometers (230,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of the Amazon Rainforest have been cleared by logging.[199]\nBy 2013, however, Brazil's \"dramatic policy-driven reduction in Amazon Basin deforestation\" was a \"global exception in terms of forest change\", according to scientific journal Science.[200]:\u200a852\u200a From 2003 to 2011, compared to all other countries in the world, Brazil had the \"largest decline in annual forest loss\", as indicated in the study using high-resolution satellite maps showing global forest cover changes,[200]:\u200a850\u200a reversing widespread deforestation from the 1970s to 2003.[200]:\u200a852\u200a In 2017, preserved native vegetation occupies 61% of the Brazilian territory. Agriculture occupied only 8% of the national territory and pastures 19.7%.[201] In terms of comparison, in 2019, although 43% of the entire European continent has forests, only 3% of the total forest area in Europe is of native forest.[202] Brazil has a strong interest in conservation as its agriculture sector directly depends on its forests.[203]\nThe form of government is a democratic federative republic, with a presidential system.[16] The president is both head of state and head of government of the Union and is elected for a four-year term,[16] with the possibility of re-election for a second successive term. The current president is Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.[204] The President appoints the Ministers of State, who assist in government.[16]\nLegislative houses in each political entity are the main source of law in Brazil. The National Congress is the Federation's bicameral legislature, consisting of the Chamber of Deputies and the Federal Senate. Judiciary authorities exercise jurisdictional duties almost exclusively. In 2021, the Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index categorized Brazil as a \"flawed democracy\", ranking 46th in the report,[205] and Freedom House classified it as a free country at Freedom in the World report.[206]\nThe political-administrative organization of the Federative Republic of Brazil comprises the Union, the states, the Federal District, and the municipalities.[16] The Union, the states, the Federal District, and the municipalities, are the \"spheres of government\". The federation is set on five fundamental principles: sovereignty, citizenship, dignity of human beings, the social values of labor and freedom of enterprise, and political pluralism.[16]\nThe classic tripartite branches of government (executive, legislative and judicial under a checks and balances system) are formally established by the Constitution.[16] The executive and legislative are organized independently in all three spheres of government, while the judiciary is organized only at the federal and state and Federal District spheres. All members of the executive and legislative branches are directly elected.[207][208][209]\nFor most of its democratic history, Brazil has had a multi-party system, with proportional representation. Voting is compulsory for the literate between 18 and 70 years old and optional for illiterates and those between 16 and 18 or beyond 70.[16] The country has more than 40 active political parties. Fifteen political parties are represented in Congress. It is common for politicians to switch parties, and thus the proportion of congressional seats held by particular parties changes regularly.[210]\nBrazilian law is based on the civil law legal system[211] and civil law concepts prevail over common law practice. Most of Brazilian law is codified, although non-codified statutes also represent a substantial part, playing a complementary role. Court decisions set out interpretive guidelines; however, they are seldom binding on other specific cases. Doctrinal works and the works of academic jurists have strong influence in law creation and in law cases. Judges and other judicial officials are appointed after passing entry exams.[207]\nThe legal system is based on the Federal Constitution, promulgated on 5 October 1988, and the fundamental law of Brazil. All other legislation and court decisions must conform to its rules.[212] As of July\u00a02022[update], there have been 124 amendments.[213] States have their own constitutions, which must not contradict the Federal Constitution.[214] Municipalities and the Federal District have \"organic laws\" (leis org\u00e2nicas), which act in a similar way to constitutions.[215] Legislative entities are the main source of statutes, although in certain matters judiciary and executive bodies may enact legal norms.[16] Jurisdiction is administered by the judiciary entities, although in rare situations the Federal Constitution allows the Federal Senate to pass on legal judgments.[16] There are also specialized military, labor, and electoral courts.[16] The highest court is the Supreme Federal Court.\nThis system has been criticized over the last few decades for the slow pace of decision-making. Lawsuits on appeal may take several years to resolve, and in some cases more than a decade elapses before definitive rulings.[216] Nevertheless, the Supreme Federal Tribunal was the first court in the world to transmit its sessions on television, and also via YouTube.[217][218] In December 2009, the Supreme Court adopted Twitter to display items on the day planner of the ministers, to inform the daily actions of the Court and the most important decisions made by them.[219]\nThe armed forces of Brazil are the largest in Latin America by active personnel and the largest in terms of military equipment.[220] The country was considered the 9th largest military power on the planet in 2021.[221][222] It consists of the Brazilian Army (including the Army Aviation Command), the Brazilian Navy (including the Marine Corps and Naval Aviation), and the Brazilian Air Force. Brazil's conscription policy gives it one of the world's largest military forces, estimated at more than 1.6\u00a0million reservists annually.[223]\nNumbering close to 236,000 active personnel,[224] the Brazilian Army has the largest number of armored vehicles in South America, including armored transports and tanks.[225] It is also unique in Latin America for its large, elite forces specializing in unconventional missions, the Brazilian Special Operations Command,[226][227][228] and the versatile Strategic Rapid Action Force, made up of highly mobilized and prepared Special Operations Brigade, Infantry Brigade Parachutist,[229][230] 1st Jungle Infantry Battalion (Airmobile)[231] and 12th Brigade Light Infantry (Airmobile)[232] able to act anywhere in the country, on short notice, to counter external aggression.[233] The states' Military Police and the Military Firefighters Corps are described as an ancillary forces of the Army by the constitution, but are under the control of each state's governor.[16]\nBrazil's navy once operated some of the most powerful warships in the world with the two Minas Geraes-class dreadnoughts, sparking a naval arms race between Argentina, Brazil, and Chile.[234] Today, it is a green water force and has a group of specialized elite in retaking ships and naval facilities, GRUMEC, unit specially trained to protect Brazilian oil platforms along its coast.[235] As of 2022[update], it is the only navy in Latin America that operates an aircraft carrier, NAM Atl\u00e2ntico, and one of twelve navies in the world to operate or have one under construction.[236][237]\nThe Air Force is the largest in Latin America and has about 700 crewed aircraft in service and effective about 67,000 personnel.[238]\nBrazil has not been invaded since 1865 during the Paraguayan War.[239] Additionally, Brazil has no contested territorial disputes with any of its neighbors[240] and neither does it have rivalries, such as that between Chile and Bolivia.[241][242] The Brazilian military has also three times intervened militarily to overthrow the Brazilian government.[243] It has built a tradition of participating in UN peacekeeping missions such as in Haiti, East Timor and Central African Republic.[244]\nBrazil's international relations are based on Article 4 of the Federal Constitution, which establishes non-intervention, self-determination, international cooperation and the peaceful settlement of conflicts as the guiding principles of Brazil's relationship with other countries and multilateral organizations.[245] According to the Constitution, the President has ultimate authority over foreign policy, while the Congress is tasked with reviewing and considering all diplomatic nominations and international treaties, as well as legislation relating to Brazilian foreign policy.[246]\nBrazil's foreign policy is a by-product of the country's position as a regional power in Latin America, a leader among developing countries, and an emerging world power.[247] Brazilian foreign policy has generally been based on the principles of multilateralism, peaceful dispute settlement, and non-intervention in the affairs of other countries.[248] Brazil is a founding member state of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP), also known as the Lusophone Commonwealth, an international organization and political association of Lusophone nations across four continents, where Portuguese is an official language.\nAn increasingly well-developed tool of Brazil's foreign policy is providing aid as a donor to other developing countries.[249] Brazil does not just use its growing economic strength to provide financial aid, but it also provides high levels of expertise and most importantly of all, a quiet non-confrontational diplomacy to improve governance levels.[249] Total aid is estimated to be around $1\u00a0billion per year, which includes.[249] In addition, Brazil already managed a peacekeeping mission in Haiti ($350\u00a0million) and makes in-kind contributions to the World Food Programme ($300\u00a0million).[249] This is in addition to humanitarian assistance and contributions to multilateral development agencies. The scale of this aid places it on par with China and India.[249] The Brazilian South-South aid has been described as a \"global model in waiting\".[250]\nIn Brazil, the Constitution establishes six different police agencies for law enforcement: Federal Police Department, Federal Highway Police, Federal Railroad Police, Federal, District and State Penal Police (included by the Constitutional Amendment No. 104, of 2019), Military Police and Civil Police. Of these, the first three are affiliated with federal authorities, the last two are subordinate to state governments and the Penal Police can be subordinated to the federal or state/district government. All police forces are the responsibility of the executive branch of any of the federal or state powers.[16] The National Public Security Force also can act in public disorder situations arising anywhere in the country.[251]\nThe country still has above-average levels of violent crime and particularly high levels of gun violence and homicide. In 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated the number of 32 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, one of the highest rates of homicide of the world.[252] The number considered tolerable by the WHO is about 10 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants.[253] In 2018, Brazil had a record 63,880 murders.[254] However, there are differences between the crime rates in the Brazilian states. While in S\u00e3o Paulo the homicide rate registered in 2013 was 10.8 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, in Alagoas it was 64.7 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants.[255]\nBrazil also has high levels of incarceration and the third largest prison population in the world (behind only China and the United States), with an estimated total of approximately 700,000 prisoners around the country (June 2014), an increase of about 300% compared to the index registered in 1992.[256] The high number of prisoners eventually overloaded the Brazilian prison system, leading to a shortfall of about 200,000 accommodations.[257]\nBrazil is a federation composed of 26 states, one federal district, and the 5,570 municipalities.[16] States have autonomous administrations, collect their own taxes and receive a share of taxes collected by the Federal government. They have a governor and a unicameral legislative body elected directly by their voters. They also have independent Courts of Law for common justice. Despite this, states have much less autonomy to create their own laws than in the United States. For example, criminal and civil laws can be voted by only the federal bicameral Congress and are uniform throughout the country.[16]\nThe states and the federal district may be grouped into regions: Northern, Northeast, Central-West, Southeast and Southern. The Brazilian regions are merely geographical, not political or administrative divisions, and they do not have any specific form of government. Although defined by law, Brazilian regions are useful mainly for statistical purposes, and also to define the distribution of federal funds in development projects.\nMunicipalities, as the states, have autonomous administrations, collect their own taxes and receive a share of taxes collected by the Union and state government.[16] Each has a mayor and an elected legislative body, but no separate Court of Law. Indeed, a Court of Law organized by the state can encompass many municipalities in a single justice administrative division called comarca (county).\nBrazil's upper-middle income mixed market economy is rich in natural resources.[260] It has the largest national economy in Latin America, the tenth-largest economy in the world by nominal GDP, and the ninth-largest by PPP. After rapid growth in preceding decades, the country entered an ongoing recession in 2014 amid a political corruption scandal and nationwide protests. A developing country, Brazil has a labor force of roughly 100 million,[261] which is the world's fifth-largest; with a high unemployment rate of 14.4% as of 2021[update].[262] Its foreign exchange reserves are the tenth-highest in the world.[263] The B3 in S\u00e3o Paulo is the largest stock exchange in Brazil. In regards to poverty, about 1.9% of the total population lives at $2.15 a day,[264] while about 19% live at $6.85 a day.[265] Brazil's economy suffers from endemic corruption and high income inequality.[266] The Brazilian real is the national currency.\nBrazil's diversified economy includes agriculture, industry, and a wide range of services.[267] The large service sector accounts for about 72.7% of total GDP, followed by the industrial sector (20.7%), while the agriculture sector is by far the smallest, making up 6.6% of total GDP.[268]\nBrazil is one of the largest producers of various agricultural commodities,[269] and also has a large cooperative sector that provides 50% of the food in the country.[270] It has been the world's largest producer of coffee for the last 150 years.[31] Brazil is the world's largest producer of sugarcane, soy, coffee and orange; is one of the top 5 producers of maize, cotton, lemon, tobacco, pineapple, banana, beans, coconut, watermelon and papaya; and is one of the top 10 world producers of cocoa, cashew, mango, rice, tomato, sorghum, tangerine, avocado, persimmon, and guava, among others. Regarding livestock, it is one of the 5 largest producers of chicken meat, beef, pork and cow's milk in the world.[271] In the mining sector, Brazil is among the largest producers of iron ore, copper, gold,[272] bauxite, manganese, tin, niobium,[273] and nickel. In terms of precious stones, Brazil is the world's largest producer of amethyst, topaz, agate and one of the main producers of tourmaline, emerald, aquamarine, garnet and opal.[274][275] The country is a major exporter of soy, iron ore, pulp (cellulose), maize, beef, chicken meat, soybean meal, sugar, coffee, tobacco, cotton, orange juice, footwear, airplanes, cars, vehicle parts, gold, ethanol, semi-finished iron, among other products.[276][277]\nBrazil is the world's 24th-largest exporter and 26th-largest importer as of 2021[update].[278][279] China is its largest trading partner, accounting for 32% of the total trade. Other large trading partners include the United States, Argentina, the Netherlands and Canada.[280] Its automotive industry is the eighth-largest in the world.[281] In the food industry, Brazil was the second-largest exporter of processed foods in the world in 2019.[282] The country was the second-largest producer of pulp in the world and the eighth-largest producer of paper in 2016.[283] In the footwear industry, Brazil was the fourth-largest producer in 2019.[284] It was also the ninth-largest producer of steel in the world.[285][286][287] In 2018, the chemical industry of Brazil was the eighth-largest in the world.[288][289][290] Although, it was among the five largest world producers in 2013, Brazil's textile industry is very little integrated into world trade.[291]\nThe tertiary sector (trade and services) represented 75.8% of the country's GDP in 2018, according to the IBGE. The service sector was responsible for 60% of GDP and trade for 13%. It covers a wide range of activities: commerce, accommodation and catering, transport, communications, financial services, real estate activities and services provided to businesses, public administration (urban cleaning, sanitation, etc.) and other services such as education, social and health services, research and development, sports activities, etc., since it consists of activities complementary to other sectors.[292][293] Micro and small businesses represent 30% of the country's GDP. In the commercial sector, for example, they represent 53% of the GDP within the activities of the sector.[294]\nTourism in Brazil is a growing sector and key to the economy of several regions of the country. The country had 6.36\u00a0million visitors in 2015, ranking in terms of the international tourist arrivals as the main destination in South America and second in Latin America after Mexico.[295] Revenues from international tourists reached US$6 billion in 2010, showing a recovery from the 2008\u20132009 economic crisis.[296] Historical records of 5.4\u00a0million visitors and US$6.8 billion in receipts were reached in 2011.[297][298] In the list of world tourist destinations, in 2018, Brazil was the 48th most visited country, with 6.6 million tourists (and revenues of 5.9 billion dollars).[299]\nNatural areas are its most popular tourism product, a combination of ecotourism with leisure and recreation, mainly sun and beach, and adventure travel, as well as cultural tourism. Among the most popular destinations are the Amazon Rainforest, beaches and dunes in the Northeast Region, the Pantanal in the Center-West Region, beaches at Rio de Janeiro and Santa Catarina, cultural tourism in Minas Gerais and business trips to S\u00e3o Paulo.[300]\nIn terms of the 2015 Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI), which is a measurement of the factors that make it attractive to develop business in the travel and tourism industry of individual countries, Brazil ranked in the 28st place at the world's level, third in the Americas, after Canada and United States.[301][302]\nBrazil's main competitive advantages are its natural resources, which ranked 1st on this criteria out of all countries considered, and ranked 23rd for its cultural resources, due to its many World Heritage Sites. The TTCI report notes Brazil's main weaknesses: its ground transport infrastructure remains underdeveloped (ranked 116th), with the quality of roads ranking in 105th place; and the country continues to suffer from a lack of price competitiveness (ranked 114th), due in part to high ticket taxes and airport charges, as well as high prices and high taxation. Safety and security have improved significantly: 75th in 2011, up from 128th in 2008.[302]\nTechnological research in Brazil is largely carried out in public universities and research institutes, with the majority of funding for basic research coming from various government agencies.[303] Brazil's most esteemed technological hubs are the Oswaldo Cruz Institute, the Butantan Institute, the Air Force's Aerospace Technical Center, the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation and the National Institute for Space Research.[304][305]\nThe Brazilian Space Agency has the most advanced space program in Latin America, with significant resources to launch vehicles, and manufacture of satellites.[306] Owner of relative technological sophistication, the country develops submarines, aircraft, as well as being involved in space research, having a Vehicle Launch Center Light and being the only country in the Southern Hemisphere the integrate team building International Space Station (ISS).[307]\nThe country is also a pioneer in the search for oil in deep water, from where it extracts 73% of its reserves.\nUranium is enriched at the Resende Nuclear Fuel Factory, mostly for research purposes (as Brazil obtains 88% of its electricity from hydroelectricity[308]) and the country's first nuclear submarine is expected to be launched in 2029.[309]\nBrazil is one of the three countries in Latin America[310] with an operational Synchrotron Laboratory, a research facility on physics, chemistry, material science and life sciences, and Brazil is the only Latin American country to have a semiconductor company with its own fabrication plant, the CEITEC.[311] According to the Global Information Technology Report 2009\u20132010 of the World Economic Forum, Brazil is the world's 61st largest developer of information technology.[312] Brazil was ranked 57th in the Global Innovation Index in 2021, up from 66th in 2019.[313][314][315][316]\nAmong the most renowned Brazilian inventors are priests Bartolomeu de Gusm\u00e3o, Landell de Moura and Francisco Jo\u00e3o de Azevedo, besides Alberto Santos-Dumont,[317] Evaristo Conrado Engelberg,[318] Manuel Dias de Abreu,[319] Andreas Pavel[320] and N\u00e9lio Jos\u00e9 Nicolai.[321]\nBrazilian science is represented by the likes of C\u00e9sar Lattes (Brazilian physicist Pathfinder of Pi Meson),[322] M\u00e1rio Schenberg (considered the greatest theoretical physicist of Brazil),[323] Jos\u00e9 Leite Lopes (only Brazilian physicist holder of the UNESCO Science Prize),[324] Artur \u00c1vila (the first Latin American winner of the Fields Medal)[325] and Fritz M\u00fcller (pioneer in factual support of the theory of evolution by Charles Darwin).[326]\nBrazil is the world's tenth largest energy consumer with much of its energy coming from renewable sources, particularly hydroelectricity and ethanol; the Itaipu Dam is the world's largest hydroelectric plant by energy generation,[327] and the country has other large plants like Belo Monte and Tucuru\u00ed. The first car with an ethanol engine was produced in 1978 and the first airplane engine running on ethanol in 2005.[328]\nAt the end of 2021 Brazil was the 2nd country in the world in terms of installed hydroelectric power (109.4 GW) and biomass (15.8 GW), the 7th country in the world in terms of installed wind power (21.1 GW) and the 14th country in the world in terms of installed solar power (13.0 GW) \u2013 on track to also become one of the top 10 in the world in solar energy.[329] At the end of 2021, Brazil was the 4th largest producer of wind energy in the world (72 TWh), behind only China, USA and Germany, and the 11th largest producer of solar energy in the world (16.8 TWh).[330]\nThe main characteristic of the Brazilian energy matrix is that it is much more renewable than that of the world. While in 2019 the world matrix was only 14% made up of renewable energy, Brazil's was at 45%. Petroleum and oil products made up 34.3% of the matrix; sugar cane derivatives, 18%; hydraulic energy, 12.4%; natural gas, 12.2%; firewood and charcoal, 8.8%; varied renewable energies, 7%; mineral coal, 5.3%; nuclear, 1.4%, and other non-renewable energies, 0.6%.[331]\nIn the electric energy matrix, the difference between Brazil and the world is even greater: while the world only had 25% of renewable electric energy in 2019, Brazil had 83%. The Brazilian electric matrix was composed of: hydraulic energy, 64.9%; biomass, 8.4%; wind energy, 8.6%; solar energy, 1%; natural gas, 9.3%; oil products, 2%; nuclear, 2.5%; coal and derivatives, 3.3%.[331]\nBrazil has the largest electricity sector in Latin America.\nIts capacity at the end of 2021 was 181,532 MW.[332]\nAs for oil, the Brazilian government has embarked on a program over the decades to reduce dependence on imported oil, which previously accounted for more than 70% of the country's oil needs. Brazil became self-sufficient in oil in 2006\u20132007. In 2021, the country closed the year as the 7th oil producer in the world, with an average of close to 3 million barrels per day, becoming an exporter of the product.[333][334]\nBrazilian roads are the primary carriers of freight and passenger traffic. The road system totaled \n1,720,000\u00a0km (1,068,758\u00a0mi) in 2019.[337] The total of paved roads increased from 35,496\u00a0km (22,056\u00a0mi) in 1967 to 215,000\u00a0km (133,595\u00a0mi) in 2018.[338][339] The country has about 14,000\u00a0km (8,699\u00a0mi) of divided highways, 5,000\u00a0km (3,107\u00a0mi) only in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo. Currently it's possible to travel from Rio Grande, in the extreme south of the country, to Bras\u00edlia (2,580\u00a0km (1,603\u00a0mi)) or Casimiro de Abreu, in the state of Rio de Janeiro (2,045\u00a0km (1,271\u00a0mi)), only on divided highways. The first investments in road infrastructure have given up in the 1920s, the government of Washington Lu\u00eds, being pursued in the governments of Get\u00falio Vargas and Eurico Gaspar Dutra.[340] President Juscelino Kubitschek (1956\u201361), who designed and built the capital Bras\u00edlia, was another supporter of highways.[341]\nBrazil's railway system has been declining since 1945, when emphasis shifted to highway construction. The total length of railway track was 30,875\u00a0km (19,185\u00a0mi) in 2002, as compared with 31,848\u00a0km (19,789\u00a0mi) in 1970. Most of the railway system belonged to the Federal Railroad Corporation RFFSA, which was privatized in 2007.[342] The S\u00e3o Paulo Metro was the first underground transit system in Brazil. The other metro systems are in Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, Recife, Belo Horizonte, Federal District, Salvador and Fortaleza. The country has an extensive rail network of 28,538 kilometers (17,733 miles) in length, the tenth largest network in the world.[343] Currently, the Brazilian government, unlike the past, seeks to encourage this mode of transport; an example of this incentive is the project of the Rio\u2013S\u00e3o Paulo high-speed rail, that will connect the two main cities of the country to carry passengers.\nThere are about 2,500 airports in Brazil, including landing fields: the second largest number in the world, after the United States.[344] S\u00e3o Paulo\u2013Guarulhos International Airport, near S\u00e3o Paulo, is the largest and busiest airport with nearly 20 million passengers annually, while handling the vast majority of commercial traffic for the country.[345]\nFor freight transport waterways are of importance, e.g. the industrial zones of Manaus can be reached only by means of the Solim\u00f5es\u2013Amazonas waterway (3,250 kilometers or 2,020 miles in length, with a minimum depth of six meters or 20 feet). The country also has 50,000 kilometers (31,000 miles) of waterways.[343] Coastal shipping links widely separated parts of the country. Bolivia and Paraguay have been given free ports at Santos. Of the 36 deep-water ports, Santos, Itaja\u00ed, Rio Grande, Paranagu\u00e1, Rio de Janeiro, Sepetiba, Vit\u00f3ria, Suape, Manaus and S\u00e3o Francisco do Sul are the most important.[346] Bulk carriers have to wait up to 18 days before being serviced, container ships 36.3 hours on average.[347]\nThe population of Brazil, as recorded by the 2008 PNAD, was approximately 190 million[348] (22.31 inhabitants per square kilometer or 57.8/sq\u00a0mi), with a ratio of men to women of 0.95:1[349] and 83.75% of the population defined as urban.[350] The population is heavily concentrated in the Southeastern (79.8\u00a0million inhabitants) and Northeastern (53.5\u00a0million inhabitants) regions, while the two most extensive regions, the Center-West and the North, which together make up 64.12% of the Brazilian territory, have a total of only 29.1\u00a0million inhabitants.\nThe first census in Brazil was carried out in 1872 and recorded a population of 9,930,478.[351] From 1880 to 1930, 4 million Europeans arrived.[352] Brazil's population increased significantly between 1940 and 1970, because of a decline in the mortality rate, even though the birth rate underwent a slight decline. In the 1940s the annual population growth rate was 2.4%, rising to 3.0% in the 1950s and remaining at 2.9% in the 1960s, as life expectancy rose from 44 to 54 years[353] and to 72.6 years in 2007.[354]\nIt has been steadily falling since the 1960s, from 3.04% per year between 1950 and 1960 to 1.05% in 2008 and is expected to fall to a negative value of\u00a0\u20130.29% by 2050[355] thus completing the demographic transition.[356]\nIn 2008, the illiteracy rate was 11.48%[357] and among the youth (ages 15\u201319) 1.74%. It was highest (20.30%) in the Northeast, which had a large proportion of rural poor.[358] Illiteracy was high (24.18%) among the rural population and lower (9.05%) among the urban population.[359]\nRace and ethnicity in Brazil[360][361][362]\nAccording to the National Research by Household Sample (PNAD) of 2008, 48.43% of the population (about 92 million) described themselves as White; 43.80% (about 83 million) as Pardo (brown), 6.84% (about 13 million) as Black; 0.58% (about 1.1\u00a0million) as East Asian (officially called yellow or amarela); and 0.28% (about 536 thousand) as Amerindian (officially called ind\u00edgena, Indigenous), while 0.07% (about 130 thousand) did not declare their race.[363]\nSince the arrival of the Portuguese in 1500, considerable genetic mixing between Amerindians, Europeans, and Africans has taken place in all regions of the country (with European ancestry being dominant nationwide according to the vast majority of all autosomal studies undertaken covering the entire population, accounting for between 65% to 77%).[364][365][366][367] From the 19th century, Brazil opened its borders to immigration. About five million people from over 60 countries migrated to Brazil between 1808 and 1972, most of them of Portuguese, Italian, Spanish, German, Ukrainian, Polish, Jewish, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, and Arab origin.[368][369] Brazil has the second largest Jewish community in Latin America making up 0.06% of its population.[370]\nBrazilian society is more markedly divided by social class lines, although a high income disparity is found between race groups, so racism and classism often overlap. Socially significant closeness to one racial group is taken in account more in the basis of appearance (phenotypes) rather than ancestry, to the extent that full siblings can pertain to different \"racial\" groups.[371] Socioeconomic factors are also significant, because a minority of pardos are likely to start declaring themselves White or Black if socially upward.[372] Skin color and facial features do not line quite well with ancestry (usually, Afro-Brazilians are evenly mixed and European ancestry is dominant in Whites and pardos with a significant non-European contribution, but the individual variation is great).[367][373][374][375] The brown population (officially called pardo in Portuguese, also colloquially moreno)[376][377] is a broad category that includes caboclos (assimilated Amerindians in general, and descendants of Whites and Natives), mulatos (descendants of primarily Whites and Afro-Brazilians) and cafuzos (descendants of Afro-Brazilians and Natives).[376][377][378][379][380] Higher percents of Blacks, mulattoes and tri-racials can be found in the eastern coast of the Northeastern region from Bahia to Para\u00edba[380][381] and also in northern Maranh\u00e3o,[382][383] southern Minas Gerais[384] and in eastern Rio de Janeiro.[380][384]\nPeople of considerable Amerindian ancestry form the majority of the population in the Northern, Northeastern and Center-Western regions.[385] In 2007, the National Indian Foundation estimated that Brazil has 67 different uncontacted tribes, up from their estimate of 40 in 2005. Brazil is believed to have the largest number of uncontacted peoples in the world.[386]\nReligion in Brazil (2010 Census)\nChristianity is the country's predominant faith, with Roman Catholicism being its largest denomination. Brazil has the world's largest Catholic population.[387][388] According to the 2010 Demographic Census (the PNAD survey does not inquire about religion), 64.63% of the population followed Roman Catholicism; 22.2% Protestantism; 2.0% Kardecist spiritism; 3.2% other religions, undeclared or undetermined; while 8.0% had no religion.[2]\nReligion in Brazil was formed from the meeting of the Catholic Church with the religious traditions of enslaved African peoples and indigenous peoples.[389] This confluence of faiths during the Portuguese colonization of Brazil led to the development of a diverse array of syncretistic practices within the overarching umbrella of Brazilian Catholic Church, characterized by traditional Portuguese festivities,[390]\nReligious pluralism increased during the 20th century,[391] and the Protestant community has grown to include over 22% of the population.[392] The most common Protestant denominations are Evangelical Pentecostal ones. Other Protestant branches with a notable presence in the country include the Baptists, Seventh-day Adventists, Lutherans and the Reformed tradition.[393]\nIn recent decades, Protestantism, particularly in forms of Pentecostalism and Evangelicalism, has spread in Brazil, while the proportion of Catholics has dropped significantly.[394] After Protestantism, individuals professing no religion are also a significant group, exceeding 8% of the population as of the 2010 census. The cities of Boa Vista, Salvador, and Porto Velho have the greatest proportion of Irreligious residents in Brazil. Teresina, Fortaleza, and Florian\u00f3polis were the most Roman Catholic in the country.[395] Greater Rio de Janeiro, not including the city proper, is the most irreligious and least Roman Catholic Brazilian periphery, while Greater Porto Alegre and Greater Fortaleza are on the opposite sides of the lists, respectively.[395]\nIn October 2009, the Brazilian Senate approved and enacted by the President of Brazil in February 2010, an agreement with the Vatican, in which the Legal Statute of the Catholic Church in Brazil is recognized. The agreement confirmed norms that were normally complied with regarding religious education in public elementary schools (which also ensures the teaching of other beliefs), marriage and spiritual assistance in prisons and hospitals. The project was criticized by parliamentarians who understood the end of the secular state with the approval of the agreement.[396][397]\nThe Brazilian public health system, the Unified Health System (Sistema \u00danico de Sa\u00fade \u2013 SUS), is managed and provided by all levels of government,[398] being the largest system of this type in the world.[399] On the other hand, private healthcare systems play a complementary role.[400]\nPublic health services are universal and offered to all citizens of the country for free. However, the construction and maintenance of health centers and hospitals are financed by taxes, and the country spends about 9% of its GDP on expenditures in the area. In 2012, Brazil had 1.85 doctors and 2.3 hospital beds for every 1,000 inhabitants.[401][402]\nDespite all the progress made since the creation of the universal health care system in 1988, there are still several public health problems in Brazil. In 2006, the main points to be solved were the high infant (2.51%) and maternal mortality rates (73.1 deaths per 1000 births).[403]\nThe number of deaths from noncommunicable diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases (151.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants) and cancer (72.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants), also has a considerable impact on the health of the Brazilian population. Finally, external but preventable factors such as car accidents, violence and suicide caused 14.9% of all deaths in the country.[403] The Brazilian health system was ranked 125th among the 191 countries evaluated by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2000.[404]\nThe Federal Constitution and the Law of Guidelines and Bases of National Education determine that the Union, the states, the Federal District, and the municipalities must manage and organize their respective education systems. Each of these public educational systems is responsible for its own maintenance, which manages funds as well as the mechanisms and funding sources. The constitution reserves 25% of the state budget and 18% of federal taxes and municipal taxes for education.[405]\nAccording to the IBGE, in 2019, the literacy rate of the population was 93.4%, meaning that 11.3 million (6.6% of population) people are still illiterate in the country, with some states like Rio de Janeiro and Santa Catarina reaching around 97% of literacy rate;[406] functional illiteracy has reached 21.6% of the population.[407] Illiteracy is higher in the Northeast, where 13.87% of the population is illiterate, while the South, has 3.3% of its population illiterate.[408][406]\nBrazil's private institutions tend to be more exclusive and offer better quality education, so many high-income families send their children there. The result is a segregated educational system that reflects extreme income disparities and reinforces social inequality. However, efforts to change this are making impacts.[409]\nThe University of S\u00e3o Paulo is the second best university in Latin America, according to recent 2019 QS World University Rankings. Of the top 20 Latin American universities, eight are Brazilian. Most of them are public.\nAttending an institution of higher education is required by Law of Guidelines and Bases of Education. Kindergarten, elementary and medium education are required of all students.[410]\nThe official language of Brazil is Portuguese (Article 13 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Brazil), which almost all of the population speaks and is virtually the only language used in newspapers, radio, television, and for business and administrative purposes. Brazil is the only Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas, making the language an important part of Brazilian national identity and giving it a national culture distinct from those of its Spanish-speaking neighbors.[411]\nBrazilian Portuguese has had its own development, mostly similar to 16th-century Central and Southern dialects of European Portuguese[412] (despite a very substantial number of Portuguese colonial settlers, and more recent immigrants, coming from Northern regions, and in minor degree Portuguese Macaronesia), with a few influences from the Amerindian and African languages, especially West African and Bantu restricted to the vocabulary only.[413] As a result, the language is somewhat different, mostly in phonology, from the language of Portugal and other Portuguese-speaking countries (the dialects of the other countries, partly because of the more recent end of Portuguese colonialism in these regions, have a closer connection to contemporary European Portuguese). These differences are comparable to those between American and British English.[413]\nThe 2002 sign language law[414] requires government authorities and public agencies to accept and provide information in L\u00edngua Brasileira dos Sinais or \"LIBRAS\", the Brazilian Sign Language, while a 2005 presidential edict[415] extends this to require teaching of the language as a part of the education and speech and language pathology curricula. LIBRAS teachers, instructors and translators are recognized professionals. Schools and health services must provide access (\"inclusion\") to deaf people.[416]\nMinority languages are spoken throughout the nation. One hundred and eighty Amerindian languages are spoken in remote areas and a significant number of other languages are spoken by immigrants and their descendants.[413] In the municipality of S\u00e3o Gabriel da Cachoeira, Nheengatu (a currently endangered South American creole language \u2013 or an 'anti-creole', according to some linguists \u2013 with mostly Indigenous Brazilian languages lexicon and Portuguese-based grammar that, together with its southern relative l\u00edngua geral paulista, once was a major lingua franca in Brazil,[417] being replaced by Portuguese only after governmental prohibition led by major political changes)[excessive detail?], Baniwa and Tucano languages had been granted co-official status with Portuguese.[418]\nThere are significant communities of German (mostly the Brazilian Hunsr\u00fcckisch, a High German language dialect) and Italian (mostly the Talian, a Venetian dialect) origins in the Southern and Southeastern regions, whose ancestors' native languages were carried along to Brazil, and which, still alive there, are influenced by the Portuguese language.[419][420] Talian is officially a historic patrimony of Rio Grande do Sul,[421] and two German dialects possess co-official status in a few municipalities.[422] Italian is also recognized as ethnic language in the Santa Teresa microregion and Vila Velha (Espirito Santo state), and is taught as mandatory second language at school.[423]\nAccording to IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) urban areas already concentrate 84.35% of the population, while the Southeast region remains the most populated one, with over 80 million inhabitants.[424]\nThe largest urban agglomerations in Brazil are S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Belo Horizonte \u2013 all in the Southeastern Region \u2013 with 21.1, 12.3, and 5.1\u00a0million inhabitants respectively.[425][426][427] The majority of state capitals are the largest cities in their states, except for Vit\u00f3ria, the capital of Esp\u00edrito Santo, and Florian\u00f3polis, the capital of Santa Catarina.[428]\nThe core culture of Brazil is derived from Portuguese culture, because of its strong colonial ties with the Portuguese Empire.[432] Among other influences, the Portuguese introduced the Portuguese language, Roman Catholicism and colonial architectural styles. The culture was also strongly influenced by African, indigenous and non-Portuguese European cultures and traditions.[433]\nSome aspects of Brazilian culture were influenced by the contributions of Italian, German and other European as well as Japanese, Jewish and Arab immigrants who arrived in large numbers in the South and Southeast of Brazil during the 19th and 20th centuries.[434] The indigenous Amerindians influenced Brazil's language and cuisine; and the Africans influenced language, cuisine, music, dance and religion.[435]\nBrazilian art has developed since the 16th century into different styles that range from Baroque (the dominant style in Brazil until the early 19th century)[436][437] to Romanticism, Modernism, Expressionism, Cubism, Surrealism and Abstractionism. Brazilian cinema dates back to the birth of the medium in the late 19th century and has gained a new level of international acclaim since the 1960s.[438]\nThe architecture of Brazil is influenced by Europe, especially Portugal. It has a history that goes back 500 years to the time when Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral landed in Brazil in 1500. Portuguese colonial architecture was the first wave of architecture to go to Brazil.[439] It is the basis for all Brazilian architecture of later centuries.[440] In the 19th century during the time of the Empire of Brazil, the country followed European trends and adopted Neoclassical and Gothic Revival architecture. Then in the 20th century especially in Brasilia, Brazil experimented with Modernist architecture.\nThe colonial architecture of Brazil dates to the early 16th century when Brazil was first explored, conquered and settled by the Portuguese. The Portuguese built architecture familiar to them in Europe in their aim to colonize Brazil. They built Portuguese colonial architecture which included churches, civic architecture including houses and forts in Brazilian cities and the countryside.[441]\nDuring 19th century, Brazilian architecture saw the introduction of more European styles to Brazil such as Neoclassical and Gothic Revival architecture. This was usually mixed with Brazilian influences from their own heritage which produced a unique form of Brazilian architecture.[441]\nIn the 1950s, the modernist architecture was introduced when Brasilia was built as new federal capital in the interior of Brazil to help develop the interior. The architect Oscar Niemeyer idealized and built government buildings, churches and civic buildings in the modernist style.[442]\nThe music of Brazil was formed mainly from the fusion of European, Native Indigenous, and African elements.[443] Until the nineteenth century, Portugal was the gateway to most of the influences that built Brazilian music, although many of these elements were not of Portuguese origin, but generally European. The first was Jos\u00e9 Maur\u00edcio Nunes Garcia, author of sacred pieces with influence of Viennese classicism.[444] The major contribution of the African element was the rhythmic diversity and some dances and instruments that had a bigger role in the development of popular music and folk, flourishing especially in the twentieth century.[443]\nPopular music since the late eighteenth century began to show signs of forming a characteristically Brazilian sound, with samba considered the most typical and on the UNESCO cultural heritage list.[445] Maracatu and Afox\u00ea are two music traditions that have been popularized by their appearance in the annual Brazilian Carnivals.[446] Capoeira is usually played with its own music referred to as capoeira music, which is usually considered to be a call-and-response type of folk music.[447] Forr\u00f3 is a type of folk music prominent during the Festa Junina in northeastern Brazil.[448] Jack A. Draper III, a professor of Portuguese at the University of Missouri,[449] argues that Forr\u00f3 was used as a way to subdue feelings of nostalgia for a rural lifestyle.[450]\nChoro is a very popular music instrumental style. Its origins are in 19th-century Rio de Janeiro. In spite of the name, the style often has a fast and happy rhythm, characterized by virtuosity, improvisation, subtle modulations and full of syncopation and counterpoint.[451] Bossa nova is also a well-known style of Brazilian music developed and popularized in the 1950s and 1960s.[452] The phrase \"bossa nova\" means literally \"new trend\".[453] A lyrical fusion of samba and jazz, bossa nova acquired a large following starting in the 1960s.[454]\nBrazilian literature dates back to the 16th century, to the writings of the first Portuguese explorers in Brazil, such as P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha, filled with descriptions of fauna, flora and commentary about the indigenous population that fascinated European readers.[455]\nBrazil produced significant works in Romanticism \u2013 novelists like Joaquim Manuel de Macedo and Jos\u00e9 de Alencar wrote novels about love and pain. Alencar, in his long career, also treated indigenous people as heroes in the Indigenist novels O Guaran\u00ed, Iracema and Ubirajara.[456] Machado de Assis, one of his contemporaries, wrote in virtually all genres and continues to gain international prestige from critics worldwide.[457][458][459]\nBrazilian Modernism, evidenced by the Modern Art Week in 1922, was concerned with a nationalist avant-garde literature,[460] while Post-Modernism brought a generation of distinct poets like Jo\u00e3o Cabral de Melo Neto, Carlos Drummond de Andrade, Vinicius de Moraes, Cora Coralina, Graciliano Ramos, Cec\u00edlia Meireles, and internationally known writers dealing with universal and regional subjects like Jorge Amado, Jo\u00e3o Guimar\u00e3es Rosa, Clarice Lispector and Manuel Bandeira.[461][462][463]\nBrazil's most significant literary award is the Cam\u00f5es Prize, which it shares with the rest of the Portuguese-speaking world. As of 2016, Brazil has eleven recipients of the prize.[464] Brazil also holds its own literary academy, the Brazilian Academy of Letters, a non-profit cultural organization pointed in perpetuating the care of the national language and literature.[465]\nBrazilian cuisine varies greatly by region, reflecting the country's varying mix of indigenous and immigrant populations. This has created a national cuisine marked by the preservation of regional differences.[466] Examples are Feijoada, considered the country's national dish;[467] and regional foods such as beiju, feij\u00e3o tropeiro, vatap\u00e1, moqueca, polenta (from Italian cuisine) and acaraj\u00e9 (from African cuisine).[468]\nThe national beverage is coffee and cacha\u00e7a is Brazil's native liquor. Cacha\u00e7a is distilled from sugar cane and is the main ingredient in the national cocktail, Caipirinha.[469]\nA typical meal consists mostly of rice and beans with beef, salad, french fries and a fried egg.[470] Often, it is mixed with cassava flour (farofa). Fried potatoes, fried cassava, fried banana, fried meat and fried cheese are very often eaten in lunch and served in most typical restaurants.[471] Popular snacks are pastel (a fried pastry); coxinha (a variation of chicken croquete); p\u00e3o de queijo (cheese bread and cassava flour / tapioca); pamonha (corn and milk paste); esfirra (a variation of Lebanese pastry); kibbeh (from Arabic cuisine); empanada (pastry) and empada, little salt pies filled with shrimps or heart of palm.\nBrazil has a variety of desserts such as brigadeiros (chocolate fudge balls), bolo de rolo (roll cake with goiabada), cocada (a coconut sweet), beijinhos (coconut truffles and clove) and romeu e julieta (cheese with goiabada). Peanuts are used to make pa\u00e7oca, rapadura and p\u00e9-de-moleque. Local common fruits like a\u00e7a\u00ed, cupua\u00e7u, mango, papaya, cocoa, cashew, guava, orange, lime, passionfruit, pineapple, and hog plum are turned in juices and used to make chocolates, ice pops and ice cream.[472]\nThe Brazilian film industry began in the late 19th century, during the early days of the Belle \u00c9poque. While there were national film productions during the early 20th century, American films such as Rio the Magnificent were made in Rio de Janeiro to promote tourism in the city.[473] The films Limite (1931) and Ganga Bruta (1933), the latter being produced by Adhemar Gonzaga through the prolific studio Cin\u00e9dia, were poorly received at release and failed at the box office, but are acclaimed nowadays and placed among the finest Brazilian films of all time.[474] The 1941 unfinished film It's All True was divided in four segments, two of which were filmed in Brazil and directed by Orson Welles; it was originally produced as part of the United States' Good Neighbor Policy during Get\u00falio Vargas' Estado Novo government.\nDuring the 1960s, the Cinema Novo movement rose to prominence with directors such as Glauber Rocha, Nelson Pereira dos Santos, Paulo Cesar Saraceni and Arnaldo Jabor. Rocha's films Deus e o Diabo na Terra do Sol (1964) and Terra em Transe (1967) are considered to be some of the greatest and most influential in Brazilian film history.[475]\nDuring the 1990s, Brazil saw a surge of critical and commercial success with films such as O Quatrilho (F\u00e1bio Barreto, 1995), O Que \u00c9 Isso, Companheiro? (Bruno Barreto, 1997) and Central do Brasil (Walter Salles, 1998), all of which were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, the latter receiving a Best Actress nomination for Fernanda Montenegro. The 2002 crime film City of God, directed by Fernando Meirelles, was critically acclaimed, scoring 90% on Rotten Tomatoes,[476] being placed in Roger Ebert's Best Films of the Decade list[477] and receiving four Academy Award nominations in 2004, including Best Director. Notable film festivals in Brazil include the S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro International Film Festivals and the Gramado Festival.\nThe Brazilian press was officially born in Rio de Janeiro on 13 May 1808 with the creation of the Royal Printing National Press by the Prince Regent Dom Jo\u00e3o.[479] The Gazeta do Rio de Janeiro, the first newspaper published in the country, began to circulate on 10 September 1808.[480] The largest newspapers nowadays are Folha de S.Paulo, Super Not\u00edcia, O Globo and O Estado de S. Paulo.[481]\nRadio broadcasting began on 7 September 1922, with a speech by then President Pessoa, and was formalized on 20 April 1923 with the creation of \"Radio Society of Rio de Janeiro\".[482]\nTelevision in Brazil began officially on 18 September 1950, with the founding of TV Tupi by Assis Chateaubriand.[483] Since then television has grown in the country, creating large commercial broadcast networks such as Globo, SBT, RecordTV, Bandeirantes and RedeTV. Today it is the most important factor in popular culture of Brazilian society, indicated by research showing that as much as 67%[484][485] of the general population follow the same daily soap opera broadcast. Digital Television, using the SBTVD standard (based on the Japanese standard ISDB-T), was adopted on 29 June 2006 and launched on 2 November 2007.[486] In May 2010, the Brazilian government launched TV Brasil Internacional, an international television station, initially broadcasting to 49 countries.[487] Commercial television channels broadcast internationally include Globo Internacional, RecordTV Internacional and Band Internacional.\nThe theatre in Brazil has its origins in the period of Jesuit expansion when theater was used for the dissemination of Catholic doctrine in the 16th century. in the 17th and 18th centuries the first dramatists who appeared on the scene of European derivation was for court or private performances.[488] During the 19th century, dramatic theater gained importance and thickness, whose first representative was Luis Carlos Martins Pena (1813\u20131848), capable of describing contemporary reality. Always in this period the comedy of costume and comic production was imposed. Significant, also in the nineteenth century, was also the playwright Ant\u00f4nio Gon\u00e7alves Dias.[489] There were also numerous operas and orchestras. The Brazilian conductor Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Gomes became internationally known with operas like Il Guarany. At the end of the 19th century orchestrated dramaturgias became very popular and were accompanied with songs of famous artists like the conductress Chiquinha Gonzaga.[490]\nAlready in the early 20th century there was the presence of theaters, entrepreneurs and actor companies, but paradoxically the quality of the products staggered, and only in 1940 the Brazilian theater received a boost of renewal thanks to the action of Paschoal Carlos Magno and his student's theater, the comedians group and the Italian actors Adolfo Celi, Ruggero Jacobbi and Aldo Calvo, founders of the Teatro Brasileiro de Comedia. From the 1960s it was attended by a theater dedicated to social and religious issues and to the flourishing of schools of dramatic art. The most prominent authors at this stage were Jorge Andrade and Ariano Suassuna.[489]\nBrazilian painting emerged in the late 16th century,[491] influenced by Baroque, Rococo, Neoclassicism, Romanticism, Realism, Modernism, Expressionism, Surrealism, Cubism and Abstracionism making it a major art style called Brazilian academic art.[492][493]\nThe French Artistic Mission arrived in Brazil in 1816 proposing the creation of an art academy modeled after the respected Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts, with graduation courses both for artists and craftsmen for activities such as modeling, decorating, carpentry and others and bringing artists like Jean-Baptiste Debret.[493]\nUpon the creation of the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts, new artistic movements spread across the country during the 19th century and later the event called Modern Art Week definitely broke with academic tradition in 1922 and started a nationalist trend which was influenced by modernist arts.[494]\nAmong the best-known Brazilian painters are Ricardo do Pilar and Manuel da Costa Ata\u00edde (baroque and rococo), Victor Meirelles, Pedro Am\u00e9rico and Almeida J\u00fanior (romanticism and realism), Anita Malfatti, Ismael Nery, Lasar Segall, Emiliano di Cavalcanti, Vicente do Rego Monteiro, and Tarsila do Amaral (expressionism, surrealism and cubism), Aldo Bonadei, Jos\u00e9 Pancetti and C\u00e2ndido Portinari (modernism).[495]\nThe most popular sport in Brazil is football.[496] The Brazilian men's national team is ranked among the best in the world according to the FIFA World Rankings, and has won the World Cup tournament a record five times.[497][498]\nVolleyball, basketball, auto racing, and martial arts also attract large audiences. The Brazil men's national volleyball team, for example, currently holds the titles of the World League, World Grand Champions Cup, World Championship and the World Cup. In auto racing, three Brazilian drivers have won the Formula One world championship eight times.[499][500][501] The country has also produced significant achievements in other sports such as sailing, swimming, tennis, surfing, skateboarding, MMA, gymnastics, boxing, judo, athletics and table tennis.\nSome sport variations have their origins in Brazil: beach football,[502] futsal (indoor football)[503] and footvolley emerged in Brazil as variations of football. In martial arts, Brazilians developed Capoeira,[504] Vale tudo,[505] and Brazilian jiu-jitsu.[506]\nBrazil has hosted several high-profile international sporting events, like the 1950 FIFA World Cup[507] and recently has hosted the 2014 FIFA World Cup, 2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica and 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica .[508] The S\u00e3o Paulo circuit, Aut\u00f3dromo Jos\u00e9 Carlos Pace, hosts the annual Grand Prix of Brazil.[509] S\u00e3o Paulo organized the IV Pan American Games in 1963, and Rio de Janeiro hosted the XV Pan American Games in 2007.[510] On 2 October 2009, Rio de Janeiro was selected to host the 2016 Olympic Games and 2016 Paralympic Games, making it the first South American city to host the games[511] and second in Latin America, after Mexico City. Furthermore, the country hosted the FIBA Basketball World Cups in 1954 and 1963. At the 1963 event, the Brazil national basketball team won one of its two world championship titles.[512]\nGovernment\nLat. and Long. 15\u00b045\u2032S 47\u00b057\u2032W\ufeff / \ufeff15.750\u00b0S

Wikipedia": {"text": "Acre ([\u02c8ak\u027ei] (listen)) is a state located in the west of the North Region of Brazil and the Amazonia Legal. Located in the westernmost part of the country, at a two-hour time difference from Bras\u00edlia, Acre is bordered clockwise by the Brazilian states of Amazonas and Rond\u00f4nia to the north and east, the Bolivian department of Pando to the southeast, and the Peruvian regions of Madre de Dios, Ucayali and Loreto to the south and west. The state, which has 0.42% of the Brazilian population, generates 0.2% of the Brazilian GDP.[3]\nIts capital and largest city is Rio Branco. Other important places include Cruzeiro do Sul, Sena Madureira, Tarauac\u00e1 and Feij\u00f3.\nIntense extractive activity in the rubber industry, which reached its height in the early 20th century, attracted Brazilians from many regions to the state. From the mixture of sulista, southeastern Brazil, nordestino, and indigenous traditions arose a diverse cuisine. It combines sun-dried meat (carne-de-sol) with pirarucu, a typical fish of the region. Such dishes are seasoned with tucupi, a sauce made from manioc.\nFluvial transport, concentrated on the Juru\u00e1 and Moa rivers, in the western part of the state, and the Tarauac\u00e1 and Envira rivers in the northwest, is the principal form of transportation, especially between November and June. Heavy seasonal rains frequently make the BR-364 impassable in those months; it usually connects Rio Branco to Cruzeiro do Sul.\nThe name, which was given to the territory in 1904, is derived from one of the local rivers, and to the state in 1962, perhaps originates from the Tupi word a'kir \u00fc \"green river\", or from the form a'kir, of the Tupi word ker, \"to sleep, to rest\". It is believed more likely to be derived from Aquiri, a transliteration by European explorers of the term Um\u00e1k\u00fcr\u00fc, or Uakiry, from the Ipurin\u00e3 dialect. Another hypothesis is that Acquiri derives from Yasi'ri, or Ysi'ri, meaning \"flowing or swift water\".\nAccording to one account, agriculturist Jo\u00e3o Gabriel de Carvalho Melo wrote during an 1878 trip on the Pur\u00fas River to merchant Viscount of Santo Elias (from Par\u00e1), asking him for goods to be sent to the \"mouth of the Aquiri River\". In Bel\u00e9m, the local merchant or his employees either misinterpreted Gabriel's handwriting, or he spelled the name wrong: the goods and invoice which Gabriel received were marked as having been sent to the Acre River.\nAcre possesses some nicknames: the End of Brazil, The Rubber Tree State, the Latex State (from when it was a center of rubber production) and the Western End.\nThe native inhabitants of Acre are called acrianos, in the singular acriano. Until the entry according to the Orthographic Agreement of 1990, the correct spelling was acreano in the singular and in the plural acreanos. In 2009, with the new orthographic agreement, the change generated controversy between the Academy of Letters of Acre (Academia Acreana de Letras) and the Brazilian Academy of Letters (Academia Brasileira de Letras). The latter said that the change would mean the denial of the state's historical and cultural roots, by changing the last letter of the toponym from \"E\" to \"I\".\nThe state of Acre occupies an area of 152,581\u00a0km2 (58,912\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) (58,911\u00a0mi2) in the extreme west of Brazil. It is located at 70\u00ba west longitude and at 9\u00ba south latitude. In Brazil, the state is part of the North Region, forming borders with the states of Amazonas and Rond\u00f4nia, and with two countries: Peru and Bolivia.\nPractically all of the terrain of the state of Acre is part of the low sandstone plateau, or terra firme, morphological unit which dominates most of the Brazilian Amazon. These terranes rise, in Acre, from the southeast to the northeast, with very tabular topography in general. In the extreme west is found the Serra da Contamana or Serra do Divisor, along the western border, with the highest altitudes in the state (609\u00a0m; 1,998\u00a0ft). About 63% of the state's surface lies between 200 and 300\u00a0m (660 and 980\u00a0ft) in height; 16% between 300 and 609 (984 and 1,998\u00a0ft); and 21% between 200 and 135 (656 and 443\u00a0ft).\nThe climate is hot and very humid, of the Am type in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system, and the monthly average temperatures vary between 24 and 27\u00a0\u00b0C (75 and 81\u00a0\u00b0F), being the lowest average of the North Region. The rainfall reaches an annual total of 2,100\u00a0mm (83\u00a0in), with a clear dry season in the months of June, July, and August.\nThe Amazon Rainforest covers all of the state territory. Very rich in rubber trees of the most valuable species (Hevea brasiliensis) and Brazil nut trees (Bertholletia excelsa), the forest guarantees that Acre is the greatest national producer of rubber and nuts. Acre's principal rivers, mostly navigable during the wet season (the Juru\u00e1, Tarauac\u00e1, Envira, Pur\u00fas, Iaco, and Acre), cross the state with almost parallel courses which converge only outside of its territory.\nThe largest recorded Black Caiman, measured at 7.7 meters (25 feet) and weighing 1,310\u00a0kg (2,890\u00a0lb), was shot in Acre in 1965.\nThe Amazon represents over half of the planet's remaining rainforests and comprises the largest and most species-rich tract of tropical rainforest in the world. Wet tropical forests are the most species-rich biome, and tropical forests in the Americas are consistently more species-rich than the wet forests in Africa and Asia.[4] As the largest tract of tropical rainforest in the Americas, the Amazonian rainforests have unparalleled biodiversity. More than 1/3 of all species in the world live in the Amazon Rainforest.[5]\nAcre is divided into twenty-two municipalities, five immediate regions and two intermediate regions:\nViceroyalty of Peru 1542\u20131824\u00a0Bolivia 1825\u20131836 Peru-Bolivian Confederation 1836\u20131839 Bolivia 1839\u20131899 First Republic of Acre 1899-1900 Bolivia 1900 Second Republic of Acre 1900 Bolivia 1900-1903 Third Republic of Acre 1903\u00a0Brazil 1903-present\nThe region of present-day Acre is thought to have been inhabited by Pre-Columbian civilizations since at least 2,100 years ago. Evidence includes complex geoglyphs of this age found in the area. The natives who crafted them are believed to have had a relatively advanced knowledge of this technology. Since at least the early 15th century, the region has been inhabited by peoples who spoke Panoan languages; their territory was geographically close to that of the Inca.\nIn the mid-18th century, the region was colonized by the Spanish and became part of the Viceroyalty of Peru. Following the Peruvian and Bolivian wars of independence, which ended in 1826, the region and large portions around it became part of Bolivia, but independent of Spain. It was a territory of the short-lived Peru\u2013Bolivian Confederation (1836\u20131839), until the two countries separated and the region returned to Bolivian control.\nThe discovery of rubber tree groves in the region in the mid-19th century attracted numerous immigrants, especially from Brazil and Europe, seeking to build on the rubber boom. Despite the increased numbers of Brazilians, the Treaty of Ayacucho (1867) determined that the region belonged to Bolivia. By 1877, Acre's population was composed almost entirely of Brazilians coming from the Northeast.\nIn 1899, Brazilian settlers from Acre created an independent state in the region called the Republic of Acre. Bolivians tried to gain control of the area, but Brazilians revolted and there were border confrontations. This resulted in what was known as the Acre War. On November 17, 1903, with the signing over and sale in the Treaty of Petr\u00f3polis, Brazil received final possession of the region. Acre was integrated into Brazil as a territory divided into three departments. The territory was acquired by Brazil for two million pounds sterling. The land was taken from Mato Grosso in accordance with terms for the construction of the Madeira-Mamor\u00e9 railway.\nAcre was united in 1920. On June 15, 1962, it was elevated to the category of state, and was the first to be governed by a woman, Iolanda Fleming, a teacher.\nDuring the early twentieth century, rubber seedlings were taken to Southeast Asia, where competitive plantations were established, reducing the importance of the Amazon in production. But during the Second World War, Japanese forces took over the rubber tree groves of Malaya.\nAcre was called on to produce rubber for the Allied war effort. The Rubber Soldiers, natives mostly of the Cear\u00e1 plantation, increased production and provided critical supplies to the Allies.\nAcre's decisive contribution to the Allied victory may have helped Brazil attract North American investment to form the National Steel Company (Companhia Sider\u00fargica Nacional) in the postwar era. This company aided in the industrialization of the Central-south, which did not yet possess basic heavy industries.\nOn April 4, 2008, Acre won a judicial debate with the state of Amazonas in relation to the dispute surrounding the Cunha Gomes Line. It annexed part of the municipalities of Envira, Guajar\u00e1, Boca do Acre, Pauini, Eirunep\u00e9 and Ipixuna. The territorial redefinition consolidated the incorporation of 1.2 million hectares of the Liberdade, Greg\u00f3rio, and Mogno forest complex to the territory of Acre, which corresponds to 11,583.87\u00a0km2 (4,472.56\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).\nSince the 1970s, numerous geoglyphs, major geometric earthworks, have been discovered on deforested land in Acre, and dated to between 1\u20131250 AD. These are cited as evidence of complex Pre-Columbian societies.[6][7] The BBC's Unnatural Histories explored studies of this area, concluding that the Amazon rainforest, rather than being a pristine \"wilderness\", has been shaped by man for at least 11,000 years. Traditional ancient practices included  forest gardening.[8] Ondemar Dias is credited as the first to discover the geoglyphs in 1977. Alceu Ranzi expanded their findings by flying over Acre.[8][9]\nDuring the 17th century, Portuguese expeditions reached many of the far ends of present-day Brazil. The expansion of the exploration to the west followed, and they reached lands under control by the Spanish colonies. The two nations negotiated to establish their territories, under the Treaties of Madrid (1750) and San Ildefonso (1777).[10] Both of the treaties were based on the explorations of Portuguese bandeirante Manoel F\u00e9lix de Lima of the Guapor\u00e9 and Madeira river basins. The treaties established the riverbeds of the Mamor\u00e9 and Guapor\u00e9 to their maximum western limits on the left bank of the Javari as the border between the Spanish and Portuguese territories.\nThe Portuguese created the new royal captaincy of Mato Grosso (1751), stimulating settlement toward the frontier. New centers developed: Vila Bela (1752)[11] on the banks of the Guapor\u00e9, Vila Maria (1778)[12] on the Paraguay River, and Casalvasco (1783).[13] Until the mid-19th century, there was little effort to settle the area systematically. At that time, the great virgin source of rubber attracted commercial interest, and development followed.\nThe empire was directed towards agricultural exports, based on coffee as the most important commodity. The territories of the extreme west were unknown and usually overlooked. For example, although C\u00e2ndido Mendes de Almeida's Atlas of the Empire of Brazil (1868), was considered a model of its time, geographers knew nothing of the Acre River and its principal tributaries, which did not appear at all in the atlas.\nSome few armed bands of Brazilian explorers exploited the rural and unpopulated region,[14] not knowing and little interested in whether they were \"controlled\" by Brazil, Peru, or Bolivia.\nBut the rubber boom of the mid-19th century, stimulated exploration by various expeditions to survey this resource and develop a plan for colonial settlement. At that time, Jo\u00e3o Rodrigues Camet\u00e1 initiated the conquest of the Pur\u00fas River;[15] Manuel Urbano da Encarna\u00e7\u00e3o, an Indian with extensive knowledge of the region, reached the Acre River, traveling up it as far as the vicinity of the Xapuri;[15] and Jo\u00e3o da Cunha Correia reached the drainage basin of the upper Tarauac\u00e1.[16] For the most part, these expeditions took place on Bolivian land.\nExploitative activities, the industrial importance of the rubber reserves, and the penetration of Brazilian colonists in the region raised the attention of Bolivia, which solicited a better fixation of boundaries. After much failed negotiation, in 1867 the Treaty of Ayacucho was signed, which recognized the colonial uti possidetis, or use of that territory by Brazil.[17] A border was established parallel to the confluence of the Beni and Mamor\u00e9 rivers, running eastward to the headwaters of the Javari River, even though the source of this river was not yet known.\nAs the price of rubber rose in the market,[18] the demand for it grew. The race to the Amazon increased. Plantations multiplied in the valleys of the Acre, Pur\u00fas and, farther west, the Tarauac\u00e1. In the year 1873\u20131874, in the drainage basin of the Pur\u00fas, the population rose from around one thousand to four thousand inhabitants. The Brazilian imperial government, already sensitive to the resulting offerings of rubber, considered the entire valley of the Pur\u00fas to be Brazilian.\nIn the second half of the 19th century, disturbances were registered in the demographic and geo-economic balance of the empire. The coffee boom in the south attracted financial resources and workers, to detriment of the northeast.[19] The growing impoverishment of that region stimulated migratory waves to the states of Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, and S\u00e3o Paulo.[19] The movement of population became particularly active during the prolonged drought of the northeastern interior, from 1877 to 1880. Hundreds of  Cear\u00e1 indigenous people headed for the rubber plantations in search of work.[20]\nThe Cearense migration reached the banks of the Juru\u00e1[21] and accelerated the occupation of land which Bolivia would later reclaim. The great fluvial rivers and their tributary systems were full of small ship fleets  transporting colonists, goods, and supply material to the most isolated centers. The governments of Amazonas and Par\u00e1 quickly established supply houses, which financed various types of operations, guaranteed credit, and promoted the commercial incentive of the rubber tree groves.[22]\nThe rubber race had the frantic urgency of gold rushes of the 18th century.[23] The situation drew the attention of the government to the economic use and development of an almost completely unknown area. The activities of private businesses would enable the government to incorporate the new region.\nIn 1890, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Pando, a Bolivian official, alerted his government to the fact that more than three hundred rubber plantations had been developed in the Jura basin, and most were occupied by Brazilians on what was nominally Bolivian territory.[24] The Brazilian penetration had advanced west from the 64th meridian to beyond the 72nd, in an extension of one thousand kilometers, despite the borders having been established. The Treaty of 1867 limited Brazil to land above the confluence of the Beni and Mamor\u00e9 rivers. [25]\nIn 1895 a new commission to define the borders was created.[23] The Brazilian representative, Greg\u00f3rio Taumaturgo de Azevedo, resigned after verifying that the ratification of the Treaty of 1867 would harm the Brazilian rubber gatherers already settled in Bolivian territory.[26][27]  In 1899, the Bolivians established an administrative post in Puerto Alonso, exacting taxes and customs duties upon Brazilian activities.[28] The following year, Brazil accepted the sovereignty of Bolivia in the zone, when it officially recognized the old boundaries at the confluence of the Beni and Mamor\u00e9 rivers.\nDistant from the diplomatic process, the rubber workers judged their interests to have been cheated, and initiated insurrection movements. Some of this was in response to brutal treatment and abuse by forces managed by the major rubber companies. In the same year that Bolivia established administration in Puerto Alonso (1899), two serious uprisings occurred.[28]\nIn April, a Cearense lawyer, Jos\u00e9 Carvalho, led an armed movement, which culminated in the expulsion of the Bolivian authorities.[23] Shortly thereafter, Bolivia began negotiations with an Anglo-American trust, the Bolivian Syndicate, in order to promote, with exceptional force (exacting of taxes, armed force), the political and economic incorporation of Acre into its territory.[23] The governor of Amazonas, Ramalho J\u00fanior, informed of the agreement by a functionary of the Bolivian consulate in Bel\u00e9m, Luis G\u00e1lvez Rodr\u00edguez de Arias, sent military contingents forward to occupy Puerto Alonso.[23] G\u00e1lvez proclaimed the independence of Acre, in the form of a republic. He became its president with the acquiescence of the rubber gatherers. Under protests from Bolivia, President Campos Sales abolished the ephemeral republic (March 1900).[23]\nBolivians, reinstated in the region, suffered in 1900 from the assault of the so-called Floriano Peixoto expedition, or \"expedition of the poets\".[29] It was made up of intellectual bohemians from Manaus.[29] Following brief fighting in the area surrounding Puerto Alonso, the expedition was completely scattered.[29]\nUltimately, the Bolivian government signed a contract with the Bolivian Syndicate (July 1901).[23] The Brazilian congress, shocked by the arbitrariness of the act, took measures, canceling commercial accords and navigation between the two countries, and suspending the right of travel to Bolivia.\nAt the same time, Brazilians organized a large armed assault on the disputed area.[23] The operations were led by a former student of the Military School of Rio Grande do Sul (Escola Militar do Rio Grande do Sul), Jos\u00e9 Pl\u00e1cido de Castro. The rubber gatherers occupied the village of Xapuri in Alto Acre (August 1902), and took  Bolivian officials into custody.[23] Finally, Pl\u00e1cido de Castro's forces besieged Puerto Alonso, proclaiming the Independent State of Acre, after the capitulation of Bolivian troops (February 1903).[23]\nJos\u00e9 Pl\u00e1cido de Castro was proclaimed governor of the new Independent State of Acre,[30] and he had to discuss the question of borders in the diplomatic sphere.[31] The Baron of Rio Branco, who had just assumed the role of Brazil's Minister of External Relations,[32] immediately opened channels which were meant to have put an end to the question.\nThe simplest problem, with the Bolivian Syndicate, was resolved by Brazil paying one hundred and ten thousand pounds to renounce the contract (February 1903).[33] Next, commercial relations were reestablished with Bolivia,[23] while a part of the territory on the upper Pur\u00fas and Juru\u00e1, militarily occupied in March 1903, was declared litigious.\nBolivia finally agreed to cede to Brazil an area of 142,800\u00a0km2 (55,100\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), in exchange for two million pounds sterling, paid in two installments.[23] Brazil committed to the construction of a Madeira-Mamor\u00e9 Railway, connecting Porto Velho to Guajar\u00e1-Mirim, at the confluence of the Beni and Madeira rivers.[23] These actions were ratified in the Treaty of Petr\u00f3polis (November 17, 1903), through which Brazil acquired the future territory, now state of Acre.[23]\nPeru had also claimed sovereignty over the entire territory of Acre and part of the state of Amazonas, based on historic colonial titles.[34] After armed conflicts between Brazilians and Peruvians on the upper Pur\u00fas and Juru\u00e1, a joint administration was established in those regions (1904).[20] The studies to determine the borders proceeded until the end of 1909, when a treaty was signed that completed the political integration of Acre into Brazilian territory.\nExercising a prominent role in national exports until 1913,[35] when rubber was introduced to European and North American markets, Acre enjoyed a period of great prosperity. At the start of the 20th century, in a period of less than ten years, it grew to have more than 50,000 inhabitants.\nFrom 1946 on, the federal government undertook actions to revive the economy of the Amazon Basin, and to include it in regional development projects.\nAttending to the judicial arrangements of the Treaty of Petr\u00f3polis, President Rodrigues Alves sanctioned the law which created the Territory of Acre (1904),[36] further dividing it into three departments: Alto Acre, Alto Pur\u00fas, and Alto Juru\u00e1, the latter being separated to form Alto Tarauac\u00e1 (1912). The departmental administration was exercised until 1921 by mayors appointed by the President of Brazil.[37] At that time the arrangements were altered, passing the administration to a governor. The second Constitution of Brazil (1934) conceded to Acre the right to elect representatives to the National Congress of Brazil.[38]\nDuring the Estado Novo (New State) political ideas involving the valorization of the interior took hold, with the intention of promoting the articulation of more isolated areas. Thereafter, the vote of 1946 commended the channeling of budgetary resources from the Union to the Amazon, determining that the Territory of Acre would be elevated to the condition of state as soon as its revenue reached the equivalent of the lowest state tax exaction.[39]\nIn the 1960s, the second cycle of efforts to accelerate the progress of the Amazon area was begun with the Superintendency of the Development of the Amazon (Superintend\u00eancia do Desenvolvimento da Amaz\u00f4nia or SUDAM, 1966).[40] Better networking of regional sub-sectors within the state was sought out, thus connecting the branch lines of the Transamaz\u00f4nica, which connected Rio Branco and Brasil\u00e9ia, on the upper course of the Acre River, and Cruzeiro do Sul, on the banks of the Juru\u00e1, crossing the valleys of the Pur\u00fas and the Tarauac\u00e1. Planning politics developed, therefore, destined to correct the demographic, economic, and political distortions of national integration.\nAccording to the IBGE of 2007, there were 664,000 people residing in the state. making Acre the third least populated state. The population density was 4.5 inh./km2.\nUrbanization: 69.6% (2006); Population growth: 3.3% (1991\u20132000); Houses: 162,000 (2006).[41]\nThe last PNAD (National Research for Sample of Domiciles) census revealed the following numbers: 441,000 Brown (Multiracial) people (66.5%), 172,000 White (26.0%), 45,000 Black (6.8%), 4,000 Asian or Amerindian people (0.7%).[42]\nAcre is inhabited by various indigenous groups of the Panoan language family, including Kashinawa, Jaminawa and Xanenawa. There are also three groups of other language families, Madiha (Kulina) of the Arawan family as well as Yine (Manchineri) and Ashaninka (Kampa) of the Arawakan family.\nPortuguese is the official national language, and thus the primary language taught in schools. English and Spanish are also part of the official high school curriculum.\nThe service sector is the largest component of GDP at 66%, followed by the industrial sector at 28.1%. Agriculture represents 5.9%, of GDP (2004). Acre exports: wood 85.6%, poultry (chicken and wild turkey) 4.7%,  wood products 1.7% (2002).\nShare of the Brazilian economy: 0.2% (2005).\nRio Branco International Airport is located in a rural zone of the municipality of Rio Branco, in the state of Acre. It was opened on November 2, 1999, with a unique characteristic: it moved 22 kilometers away from the previous airport site. Rio Branco Airport serves domestic and international flights (by scheduled carriers and air taxi firms) along with general and military aviation. The terminal can receive 270 thousand passengers a year and serves an average of 14 daily operations.\nCruzeiro do Sul International Airport is located 18 kilometers away from the city center, which helps access to the Alto Juru\u00e1 region. It was opened on October 28, 1970, and absorbed by Infraero on March 31, 1980. The airport infrastructure was built in 1976 by the municipal government. In 1994 the runway was totally renovated.\nRio Branco provides visitors and residents with various sport activities.\nThe Arena da Floresta stadium in Rio Branco was one of the 18 candidates to host games in the 2014 FIFA World Cup, which was held in Brazil, but did not make it to the final 12 chosen.\nThe flag was adopted on March 15, 1921. It is a variation of the flags used by the secessionist state of Acre, with the yellow and green parts exchanged and mirrored. The yellow color symbolizes peace, green hope, and the star symbolizes the light which guided those who worked to make Acre a state of Brazil.", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acre_(state)",

Gusm\u00e3o - Wikipedia": {"text": "Bartolomeu Louren\u00e7o de Gusm\u00e3o (December 1685 \u2013 18 November 1724) was a Portuguese born in Brazil priest and naturalist, who was a pioneer of lighter-than-air airship design.\nGusm\u00e3o was born at Santos, then part of the Portuguese colony of Brazil.\nHe began his novitiate in the Society of Jesus at Bahia when he was about fifteen years old, but left the order in 1701. He went to Portugal and found a patron at Lisbon in the person of the Marquis of Abrantes. He completed his course of study at the University of Coimbra, devoting his attention principally to philology and mathematics, but received the title of Doctor of Canon Law (related to Theology). He is said to have had a remarkable memory and a great command of languages.\nIn 1709 he presented a petition to King Jo\u00e3o V of Portugal, seeking royal favour for his invention of an airship, in which he expressed the greatest confidence. The contents of this petition have been preserved, together with a picture and description of his airship. Developing the ideas of Francesco Lana de Terzi,[citation needed] S.J., Gusm\u00e3o wanted to spread a huge sail over a boat-like body like the cover of a transport wagon; the boat itself was to contain tubes through which, when there was no wind, air would be blown into the sail by means of bellows. The vessel was to be propelled by the agency of magnets which were to be encased in two hollow metal balls.[citation needed] The public test of the machine, which was set for 24 June 1709, did not take place.\nIt is known that Gusm\u00e3o was working on this principle at the public exhibition he gave before the Court on 8 August  1709, in the hall of the Casa da \u00cdndia in Lisbon, when he propelled a ball to the roof by combustion.  The king rewarded the inventor by appointing him to a professorship at Coimbra and made him a canon.  He was also one of the fifty selected as members of the Academia Real de Hist\u00f3ria, founded in 1720; and in 1722 he was made chaplain to the Court. Gusm\u00e3o also busied himself with other inventions, but in the meantime continued his work on his airship schemes, the idea for which he is said to have conceived while a novice at Bahia. His designs included a ship to sail in the air consisting of a triangular gas-filled pyramid, but he died without making progress.\nOne account of Gusm\u00e3o's work suggests that the Portuguese Inquisition forbade him to continue his aeronautic investigations and persecuted him because of them, but this is probably a later invention.  It dates, however, from at least the end of the 18th century, as the following article in the London Daily Universal Register (later The Times) of 20 October 1786, makes clear:\nBy accounts from Lisbon we are assured, that in consequence of the experiments made there with the Montgolfier balloon, the literati of Portugal had been incited to make numerous researches on the subject; in consequence of which they pretend that the honour of the invention is due to Portugal.  They say that in 1720, a Brazilian Jesuit, named Bartholomew Gusmao, possessed of abilities, imagination, and address, by permission of John V. fabricated a balloon in a place contiguous to the Royal Palace, and one day, in presence of their Majesties, and an immense crowd of spectators, raised himself, by means of a fire lighted in the machine, as high as the cornice of the building; but through the negligence and want of experience of those who held the cords, the machine took an oblique direction, and, touching the cornice, burst and fell.\nThe balloon was in the form of a bird with a tail and wings.  The inventor proposed to make new experiments, but, chagrined at the raillery of the common people, who called him wizzard, and terrified by the Inquisition, he took the advice of his friends, burned his manuscripts, disguised himself, and fled to Spain, where he soon after died in an hospital.\nThey add, that several learned men, French and English, who had been at Lisbon to verify the fact, had made enquiries at the Carmelite monastery, where Gusmao had a brother, who had preserved some of his manuscripts on the manner of constructing aerostatic machines.  Various living persons affirm that they were present at the Jesuit's experiments, and that he received the surname of Voador, or Flying-man.\nContemporary documents do attest that information was laid before the Inquisition against Gusm\u00e3o, but on quite another charge.  The inventor fled to Spain and fell ill of a fever, of which he died in Toledo. He wrote: Manifesto summ\u00e1rio para os que ignoram poderse navegar pelo elemento do ar (Short Manifesto for those who are unaware that is possible to sail through the element air, 1709); and V\u00e1rios modos de esgotar sem gente as naus que fazem \u00e1gua (Several ways of draining, without people, ships that leak water, 1710); some of his sermons also have been printed.\nIn 1936, the Bartolomeu de Gusm\u00e3o Airport was built in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, by the Luftschiffbau Zeppelin to operate with the rigid airships Graf Zeppelin and Hindenburg. In 1941, it was taken over by the Brazilian Air Force and renamed Santa Cruz Air Force Base. Presently, the airport serving Araraquara is named Bartolomeu de Gusm\u00e3o Airport.", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartolomeu_de_Gusm%C3%A3o", "

producing countries of agricultural commodities - Wikipedia": {"text": "Production (and consumption) of agricultural plant commodities has a diverse geographical distribution. Along with climate and corresponding types of vegetation, the economy of a nation also influences the level of agricultural production. Production of some products is highly concentrated in a few countries, China, the leading producer of wheat and ramie in 2013, produces 6% of the world's ramie fiber but only 17% of the world's wheat. Products with more evenly distributed production see more frequent changes in the ranking of the top producers.\nThe major agricultural products can be broadly categorised into foods, fibers, fuels,

literature references.\nThe Bibliographic Reference Code (refcode) was originally developed to be used in SIMBAD and the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED), but it became a de facto standard and is now used more widely, for example, by the NASA Astrophysics Data System, which coined and prefers the term \"bibcode\".[1][2]\nThe code has a fixed length of 19 characters and has the form\nwhere YYYY is the four-digit year of the reference and JJJJJ is a code indicating where the reference was published. In the case of a journal reference, VVVV is the volume number, M indicates the section of the journal where the reference was published (e.g., L for a letters section), PPPP gives the starting page number, and A is the first letter of the last name of the first author. Periods (.) are used to fill unused fields and to pad fields out to their fixed length if too short; padding is done on the right for the publication code and on the left for the volume number and page number.[1][2] Page numbers greater than 9999 are continued in the M column. The 6-digit article ID numbers (in lieu of page numbers) used by the Physical Review publications since the late 1990s are treated as follows: The first two digits of the article ID, corresponding to the issue number, are converted to a lower-case letter (01 = a, etc.) and inserted into column M. The remaining four digits are used in the page field.[2]\nSome examples of bibcodes are:", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibcode_(identifier)", "

political science and philosophy in 1954 from Denison University. He received a Fulbright Fellowship to study philosophy at Magdalen College, Oxford where he met his wife Felicity. He received a second B.A. in Philosophy, Politics and Economics in 1956 and a master's degree in 1959. He obtained his Ph.D. at Harvard University in 1960 with a thesis on the German Chancellor Leo von Caprivi.[2]\nHis attention shifted to South America after the Cuban Revolution. His Harvard post-doctorate focused on Brazil. In 1967 he published Politics in Brazil: 1930-64, An Experiment in Democracy.[2]\nHe began his teaching career at Harvard as an instructor (1960-61), research fellow in Latin American studies (1961-64), and then assistant professor (1964-66).[3]  In 1966, Skidmore joined the faculty of the University of Wisconsin, Madison. He became a full professor in 1968. In 1986, Skidmore moved to Brown University.[2]\nThis biography of an American historian is a stub.

of Brazil) - Wikipedia": {"text": "Regency period is how the decade from 1831 to 1840 became known in the history of the Empire of Brazil, between the abdication of Emperor Pedro I on 7 April 1831 and the Golpe da Maioridade, when his son Pedro II was legally declared of age by the Senate at the age of 14 on 23 July 1840.\nBorn on 2 December 1825, Pedro II was, at the time of his father's abdication, 5 years and 4 months old, and therefore could not assume the government which, by law, would be headed by a regency made up of three representatives. During this decade there were four regencies: the Provisional Triumviral, the Permanent Triumviral, the una (sole) of Diogo Ant\u00f4nio Feij\u00f3 and the una of Pedro de Ara\u00fajo Lima.\nIt was one of the most defining and eventful periods in Brazilian history; in this period the territorial unity of the country was established and the Armed Forces were structured, in addition, it was the period when the degree of autonomy of the provinces and the centralization of power was discussed.\nIn this phase, a series of local provincial rebellions took place, such as the Cabanagem, in Gr\u00e3o-Par\u00e1, the Balaiada in Maranh\u00e3o, the Sabinada, in Bahia, and the Ragamuffin War, in Rio Grande do Sul, the latter being the largest and longest. These revolts showed the growing discontent with the central power and the latent social tensions of the newly independent nation, which provoked the joint effort of their opponents and the central government to maintain order. Historians have remarked that the regency period was the first republican experience in Brazil, given its elective nature.[1]\nAccording to historian Em\u00edlia Viotti da Costa, the structure which came to be as a result of the Independence of Brazil led to the organization of a political system that placed the municipalities dependant on the provinces and these on the central power; and also that:\n\"A system of indirect elections based on qualified (census) suffrage, which excluded most of the population from the electoral process, was adopted. They eagerly disputed titles of nobility and monopolized positions in the Chamber of Deputies, the Senate, the Council of State and the Ministries\".[2]\nThis \"Council of State\" implemented the Moderating Power instituted by emperor Pedro I when he dissolved the Constituent Assembly that was tasked with drafting Brazil's first constitution right after its independence from Portugal. The Constituent Assembly was formed by lifetime members, which were appointed by the monarch and no more than ten in number. Their function was to be heard \"in all serious and general measures of public administration, especially concerning the declaration of war, peace negotiations, negotiations with foreign nations, as well as on all occasions when the Emperor proposed to exercise any of the prerogatives of the Moderating Power\" - and to which the liberals were strongly opposed.[3]\nThe 1830 revolutions across Europe, which resulted in the overthrow of the French monarch Charles X, spread its liberal ideas to other nations, including Brazil. Liberal newspapers such as the Aurora Fluminense, published by Evaristo da Veiga in Rio de Janeiro, started to appear in the country; in S\u00e3o Paulo, the death of liberal journalist L\u00edbero Badar\u00f3 severely steered public opinion against the emperor.[4]\nThe liberals - divided between the moderated and the exalted - sought Pedro I to secure a moderate ministry and disconnect it from the institutional framework inherited from his father. They were opposed by the restorers - who defended its permanence. The emperor had made a trip to Minas Gerais, where he was received with apathy; upon returning to the court, he was received by the Portuguese nationals in Brazil with a nighttime demonstration of luminaries. The Brazilians reacted and the conflict known as the Night of the Bottle Fight took place. The emperor then dismissed all the ministers, which were of a moderate leaning, and replaced them with others that were perceived as absolutist - this inflamated public opinion even more against him.[4]\nPedro I's reaction as a result of the popular unrest and the events that followed caused surprise even among the exalted liberals, as the emperor decided to abdicate in favor of his son at dawn on 7 April 1831. His opponents only wanted the restoration of the moderate ministry. The abdication led the establishment of the regency.[4]\nDespite the parliamentary recess, within a few hours after Pedro I's abdication, the senators and deputies who were in the Court met. They officially received the Emperor's resignation in the Palace of the Senate from general Francisco de Lima e Silva.[5] They elected a Provisional Regency, composed of three senators: Francisco de Lima e Silva, Nicolau Pereira de Campos Vergueiro and Jos\u00e9 Joaquim Carneiro de Campos.[4] It was thus composed of a prestigious military officer, a liberal and a conservative, respectively.[5] Such regency was provided for in title 5, chapter V, articles 121 to 130 of the Political Constitution of the Empire of Brazil.[6]\nAs soon as it took office, one of the regency's first acts was to restore the ministers dismissed by Pedro I to their positions. It convened the Legislative Assembly, gave amnesty to political prisoners and removed suspicious and disorderly foreigners from the troops.[4]\nA manifesto was published in which the people were exhorted to maintain order, and further explaining the political and administrative guidelines of the new government.[5] In it the governing board declared, with exaggeration, that its enemies \"were so few and so weak, that they deserved no consideration; but that it watched over them as if they were many and strong\".[7] Despite efforts to restore order, it could not prevent conflicts between soldiers and Portuguese supporters of the Restorer Party, which sought to restore Pedro I to the throne of Brazil, both in Rio and in the provinces.[4]\nTwo days after the abdication, on April 9, the young successor to the throne was acclaimed emperor. The board of regents took him to the Imperial Palace, where he was presented to the people. So young, the boy had to wave his handkerchief over a chair, in a scene that was portrayed by French painter Jean-Baptiste Debret.[8] On the same day, the board issued an amnesty decree \"to citizens convicted or even sentenced for political crimes and to military defendants convicted of crimes of desertion\".[6]\nPedro I had appointed Jos\u00e9 Bonif\u00e1cio de Andrada e Silva, with whom he had reconciled after a troubled breakup, as his children's tutor. For the protection of the young emperor and his sisters, Francisca and Janu\u00e1ria, who also remained in the country. The princes stayed in the palace of S\u00e3o Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o or Boa Vista, then in the suburbs of the capital. A troubled period had begun, in which the territorial unity and the central authority of Brazil were questioned and put to the test by riots, revolts and rebellions.[9]\nJos\u00e9 Bonif\u00e1cio, had asked French diplomat Edouard Pontois to support a possible transfer of the young prince, in case of need due to political instabilities, to S\u00e3o Paulo, where he would move the capital, obtaining an evasive response from the diplomat.[9]\nPedro I had stayed in Brazilian waters until his return to Europe; initially boarded in an English frigate, it was in the French corvette Volage that the former emperor departed to Europe.[4] On April 13, the regency announced the former monarch's departure from Brazil and the people took to the streets to celebrate the \"fall of the tyrant\".[6]\nThe Provisional Regency had to act immediately to contain revolts that broke out in the provinces: in Bahia, under the pretext of old distrusts from the Brazilian War of Independence, Brazilians attacked Portuguese nationals. Likewise, the regency also had to act in Pernambuco and Minas Gerais.[7]\nThe provisional character of this regency lasted until the election of a new triumviral regency, now \"permanent\", on 3 May 1831.[5]\nOn 17 June 1831, in the Palace of the Senate, with the Legislative General Assembly gathered and presided over by Jos\u00e9 Caetano da Silva Coutinho, a senator and bishop of S\u00e3o Paulo, the election of the Permanent Triumviral Regency took place. The elected regents were the deputies Jos\u00e9 da Costa Carvalho from Bahia, Jo\u00e3o Br\u00e1ulio Muniz from Maranh\u00e3o, and senator Francisco de Lima e Silva from Rio de Janeiro. The election was based on article 123 of the 1824 Constitution.[6] As the moderates made up the majority in the parliament, the elected regents were also adherents of this side, thus leaving out the exalted ones (in a large minority, especially in the Chamber of Deputies).[10]\nThe composition of this triumvirate sought to maintain the balance of forces that already existed in the provisional regency: representing the north and northeast was Jo\u00e3o Br\u00e1ulio Muniz from Maranh\u00e3o, who replaced Carneiro de Campos in this role;[a] the south and southeast were represented by Costa Carvalho who, despite being born in Bahia, lived in S\u00e3o Paulo, where he published the newspaper O Farol Paulistano. Lima e Silva was, therefore, the only one of the Provisional Regency who was re-elected as regent.[12]\nIn its administration, the newly elected regency promoted the reforms of the Schools of Medicine in Rio and Salvador, converting them into faculties; the judicial power was reorganized and the jury trial was established.[4]\nAmong the first measures that the liberal majority proposed was to reform the legislation that regulated the regency itself. This amendment was drafted by deputies Francisco de Paula Sousa e Melo, the regent Costa Carvalho, and Hon\u00f3rio Hermeto Carneiro Le\u00e3o,[b] from Minas Gerais, and aimed at increasing the primacy of the Legislative power over the Executive.[12]\nThrough the reform, the Moderating power came to be exercised by the regency itself, through the Minister who was invested with such power, and its prerogatives were further reduced. Unlike when it was first instituted by emperor Pedro I, it would no longer have the power to dismiss the Chamber of Deputies - although this was already included in the changes made during the Provisional Regency, which also could not grant noble titles or decorations.[5]\nOne of the innovations instituted by the Triumviral Regency was the creation of the National Guard, already in 1831. This military force relegated the army to a secondary role and constituted the main public force with which the central power would seek to contain the riots that broke out. Its structure was made up of provinces, and was subordinated to the provincial government: first, they were linked to the jurisdiction of the justice of the peace, in charge of enlistment; after these they were subordinated to the criminal judges, to the presidents of the provinces and, finally, to the Minister of Justice.[12]\nAll citizens between the ages of 21 and 60 eligible to vote were required to enlist; it was up to the government to supply them with weapons, but the uniforms were up to the enlisted men. Command positions were elective at each location. A model was sought that privileged the civic participation of the citizens, as occurred in the similar institution in France, which inspired the Brazilian one.[12]\nIts main role was the maintenance of the territorial unity of the Empire and the suppression of local revolts.[12]\nDiogo Antonio Feij\u00f3, Minister of Justice, resigned for not overthrowing Bonif\u00e1cio\nJos\u00e9 Bento Leite Ferreira de Melo, one of the priests of the \"Revolution of the 3 Priests\"\nHon\u00f3rio Hermeto Carneiro Le\u00e3o, stopped the 30th of July coup\nThe regency found the country in serious difficulties, as a result of a serious financial crisis and unrest that threatened national unity. To face this situation, Diogo Ant\u00f4nio Feij\u00f3, also a deputy, was appointed as Minister of Justice.[4]\nThe Moderate and the Exalted parties were later joined by the Restorer (its members were nicknamed caramurus), who preached the return of Emperor Pedro I and was headed by Jos\u00e9 Bonif\u00e1cio,[4] who had recovered his previous political prestige by being appointed tutor to the young monarch.[5]\nFaced with nationwide instability, Feij\u00f3 demanded that the Regency give him written authorization that he would have full autonomy in the affairs of his ministry, so that he could face the riots that broke out, especially in Rio de Janeiro. Part of the unrest, provoked by Jos\u00e9 Bonif\u00e1cio and the caramurus, aimed to destabilize the regency. On 3 April 1832, a revolt broke out in the capital, in the midst of many political intrigues; blaming Bonif\u00e1cio for the agitations, Feij\u00f3 demanded his resignation from his position of tutor, having declared: \"either Jos\u00e9 Bonif\u00e1cio leaves the tutorship or I leave the ministry of Justice\".[5]\nThe deputies, with a moderate majority, were in favor of the dismissal requested by Feij\u00f3; but the senate, where Bonif\u00e1cio still enjoyed prestige and had a conservative majority, rejected, by a difference of just one vote, the project to dismiss the tutor; Feij\u00f3 then presented his resignation on April 5.[5]\nIn his office Feij\u00f3 acted with great rigor and efficiency. He also had the Feij\u00f3 Law approved, which freed slaves who came from outside the empire, but whose effectiveness was null.[5]\nDespite now being outside the government, Feij\u00f3 made a new attempt to make moderate reforms prosper in the episode that became known as the 30th of July coup. Counting on the help of priest Jos\u00e9 Bento Leite Ferreira de Melo in the typography where Melo edited the newspaper O Pregoeiro Constitucional - a liberal newspaper that opposed Pedro I - the Constitution of Pouso Alegre was printed, a kind of new Letter that brought the amendments that dragged on in the General Assembly, and that the coup planned to see approved.[13]\nBonif\u00e1cio lost prestige with the death of Pedro I and was arrested\nThe Marquis of Itanha\u00e9m replaced Jos\u00e9 Bonif\u00e1cio as tutor of emperor Pedro II\nThe coup failed, above all because it lacked the support of the deputies, most of whom were averse to adopting measures that contradicted the constitutional order itself.[12] The then unknown town of Pouso Alegre, a few years prior known simply as Arraial de Mandu, became known throughout Brazil,[13] thanks to the figure of priest Jos\u00e9 Bento, who had gained notoriety. In addition to Feij\u00f3 (who was a catholic priest himself) and Jos\u00e9 Bento, there was a third priest, Jos\u00e9 Cust\u00f3dio Dias,[14] who lent his estate to serve as the location to the preparations for the plot. This led the coup to also be called the \"Revolution of the Three Priests\".[13]\nIn addition to the approval of the Constitution of Pouso Alegre, the priests wanted to remove Jos\u00e9 Bonif\u00e1cio from the post of tutor of the future monarch. The coup's failure was in great part thanks to Hon\u00f3rio Hermeto Carneiro Le\u00e3o, the Marquis of Paran\u00e1, who acted as the most important dissent figure among the liberals, and the one who sought to dissuade his peers from supporting the initiative, mainly for fear that the act could serve as an example to other breaches of legality.[14]\nFearful that Jos\u00e9 Bonif\u00e1cio would use the young monarch as a guarantee to attempt new coups, the regents demanded that he would not leave the Imperial Palace. Despite this, Bonif\u00e1cio took Pedro II and his sisters to the Palace of S\u00e3o Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o; Aureliano Coutinho, who had replaced Feij\u00f3 in the Ministry of Justice, demanded Bonif\u00e1cio's return, which he disobeyed. On 15 December 1833, Jos\u00e9 Bonif\u00e1cio was finally dismissed. Manuel In\u00e1cio de Andrade, the Marquis of Itanha\u00e9m, was appointed to the position of Royal Tutor to replace Bonif\u00e1cio.[5] One of the key figures behind Bonif\u00e1cio's dismissal and imprisonment was C\u00e2ndido de Ara\u00fajo Viana.[15]\nJos\u00e9 Bonif\u00e1cio was then arrested and later sent to the Paquet\u00e1 Island, where he remained in his beach house. After his trial, he was finally acquitted of the charges; however, Bonif\u00e1cio did not recover from this last blow, dying a few years later in Niter\u00f3i.[15]\nThe Additional Act was a direct result of the liberal majority in the Chamber of Deputies, which preached greater autonomy for the provinces and was a programmatic goal of the liberals. Thus, the Regency proposed that the 1824 Constitution be amended.[5]\nThe project for the constitutional amendment had been proposed in 1831 by a commission composed mostly of liberal deputies from the province of S\u00e3o Paulo; it included Francisco de Paula Sousa e Melo and Jos\u00e9 Ces\u00e1rio de Miranda Ribeiro. The initial proposal contained quite radical changes, in the sense of expanding provincial power, these included: the election of a sole regent would be made by the provincial assemblies, as well as the senators; the senators would lose their status of senators for life; the Executive's veto power would be limited, and could be overthrown by a simple majority in the parliament. The point of greatest controversy, however, was the insertion in Article One of the constitution of the words \"the government of the Empire of Brazil shall be a federative monarchy\".[12]\nThe Senate reacted through amendments that altered the text originated in the Chamber; those that were rejected had to be considered in a joint session of the two houses and, in it, the senators managed to block the insertion of the federal system in Article One and maintain their lifetime status.[12]\nRatified on 12 August 1834, the Additional Act adapted federalist principles to the monarchy. Its main editor was deputy Bernardo Pereira de Vasconcelos,[5] who had been a colleague and friend of two of the regents from his college days in the University of Coimbra,[11] and was one of the most influential deputies. Among its biggest innovations were:[5]\nHistorian Jo\u00e3o Batista Ribeiro de Andrade Fernandes remarked that politics then took a new direction, with a supremacy of the Moderate Party:\n\"The most complete expression of this policy is found in the Additional Act that satisfied the local demands by creating provincial assemblies and abolished the Council of State while reinforcing the authority of the central government by reducing the regents to a single one; with great prudence it was possible to prevent the fragmentation of the country, which was the adoption of elected presidents for the provinces and thus other radical proposals did not find approval\".[16]\nIn 1835, the first election to choose the sole regent took place. The candidates were the exalted Ant\u00f4nio Francisco de Paula de Holanda Cavalcanti de Albuquerque, from Pernambuco, and Diogo Ant\u00f4nio Feij\u00f3, from S\u00e3o Paulo, from the Moderate Party; the latter emerged victorious from the election, obtaining about six thousand votes.[17] This Regency lasted from 12 October 1835 to 19 September 1837.[5]\nFeij\u00f3 faced difficulties from his very first moments in office; among his opponents stood out Bernardo Pereira de Vasconcelos, Hon\u00f3rio Hermeto Carneiro Le\u00e3o and Maciel Monteiro. To face them, Feij\u00f3 unsuccessfully tried to found a new party, the Progressist.[17] His opponents, however, succeeded in founding the Regressive Party (composed of the former restorers and liberals and was the basis of the future Conservative Party). Feij\u00f3 also did not have the support of the Holy See, as he was a defender of the end of celibacy for the catholic priests, and for having insisted on launching his friend Manuel Maria de Moura as a candidate for bishop of Rio de Janeiro, who had already been refused by the Pope.[5]\nWith skill, however, his policy gave way in some points, such as having accepted decentralization proposals; he tried to satisfy the peoples and provincial demands, without, however, strengthening the aristocrats or the parliament; and, finally, he acted rigorously in repelling merchants and large landowners. Despite depending on the Congress, he was not obedient to it.[17]\nHis regency was marked by the beginning of two of the most serious internal conflicts in Brazil: the Cabanagem, in Par\u00e1, and Ragamuffin War, in Rio Grande do Sul, in addition to other local revolts.[5]\nWith a fragile health,[17] Feij\u00f3 was discouraged and without the same energy that he had when at the head of the Ministry of Justice.[5] Feij\u00f3 ended up becoming unpopular for his intransigence and losing the support of his great ally Evaristo da Veiga, who had died prematurely. Feij\u00f3 was unable to form the ministry he wanted, and ended up resigning from the position of regent.[4]\nOn the eve of his resignation, Feij\u00f3 had appointed as Minister of the Empire the conservative Pedro de Ara\u00fajo Lima. Lima formed, as interim regent, the so-called Ministry of Capabilities, which obtained a relative order and a certain economic development - this enabled him to run for regent in the elections that were held in April 1838.[5]\nAmong the main achievements of his interim regency was the foundation of the Col\u00e9gio Pedro II, in 1837.[5]\nAfter his interim period, Pedro de Ara\u00fajo Lima ran for office in the elections that took place in April 1838. Running with him was, once again, Ant\u00f4nio Francisco de Paula de Holanda Cavalcanti de Albuquerque, whom Lima easily defeated.[5]\nDuring his regency, the Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute was founded and the Military School was reformed.[5] Ara\u00fajo Lima represented the end of liberal policies, with the suppression of the Criminal Procedure Code and the Additional Act (the latter being later made official by the so-called Interpretative Law of the Additional Act, of 12 May 1840) - which increased the centralization of power, decreasing provincial and municipal autonomy, by controlling the police and the judiciary.[18]\nAlthough he did not face the turmoil that had troubled the previous governments, Ara\u00fajo Lima had to deal with the Ragamuffin War, which continued to rage in southern Brazil, the Cabanagem, in Gr\u00e3o-Par\u00e1, and also with other provincial revolts: the Sabinada, in Bahia, and the Balaiada, in Maranh\u00e3o.[4] His government promoted intense repression of the rebels. In Bahia and Maranh\u00e3o there was great violence.[18]\nPolitical disputes in the Congress increased in the second year of his government, which resulted in the declaration of age of emperor Pedro II and consequently in the end of the regency period.[18]\nAra\u00fajo Lima was, in the words of historian Oct\u00e1vio Tarqu\u00ednio de Sousa:\n\"The constitutional king that Feij\u00f3 didn't know how to be, but knew how to choose\".[19]\nOr yet:\n\"It could be said that the continued exercise of the presidency of the Chamber of Deputies had given him the habit of a spectator, or rather, of an arbitrator, making him willing to act only as the mediator, who composes, accommodates and prevents clashes and disagreements\".[19]\nSeveral rebellions broke out during the regency period, seen by historiography in general from two approaches: a more conservative one, which portrays them as mere \"disorders\", and another that seeks to boast that they had \"popular causes\".[20]\nAmong the rebellions there were three slave revolts: the Carrancas Revolt in Minas Gerais (1833), the Mal\u00ea Revolt in Salvador (1835) and the Manuel Congo revolt in Rio de Janeiro (1838).[20] In a period of nine years, rebellions broke out in almost all of Brazil, most of them resulting from the dissatisfaction of the regional elites allied with the urban middle class (made up of liberal workers such as journalists, officials and the military) who, dissatisfied with the central power in Rio de Janeiro, protested against the economic hardships, the increase of taxes and the appointment of governors without local support.[18]\nThe main rebellions of the period were:\nIt broke out in Pernambuco, among the poorer strata of the population - called cabanos, as in the Cabanagem in Par\u00e1 - and was caused mainly by the misunderstanding of the humble classes in face of the changes in the regime resulting from the abdication of Pedro I, which is why they had support from Recife's restorers.[21]\nWith religious ideals, the Cabanada was finally defeated in 1835 by Manuel de Carvalho Pais de Andrade - the same officer who, in 1824, proclaimed the Confederation of the Equator and presided over the province.[21]\nHalf the population of the city of Salvador consisted of blacks who carried out profitable activities for their masters, in professions such as tailors, carpenters or street vendors. In January 1835, Muslim slaves, then called mal\u00eas, organized a revolt that had an intense reaction from the government, which decimated them.[18]\nIt was the largest of the country's urban slave uprisings, although it lasted less than a day; around 600 slaves took over the capital, most of them literate in Arabic and in the religious context of a jihad. In the intense fighting 70 slaves died, and about 500 were arrested and sentenced to lashes, imprisonment or death.[22]\nIts main effect, along with the other slave uprisings of the period, was to sow fear in the ruling class, which reacted in two ways: on the one hand, it reinforced repressive laws and, on the other, it opened the debate on the slavery issue.[22]\nThe rebellion began in 1835 in Bel\u00e9m, then a small city with 12,000 inhabitants, of which very few were white. The majority was of indigenous people, slaves and mestizos. After disagreements among the elites over the choice of the new president of the province, which, at the time, had very few ties with the central government in Rio de Janeiro, independence was proclaimed.[23]\nBel\u00e9m was then attacked by troops made up mostly of mestizos, amerindians and blacks, among which Eduardo Angelim, from Cear\u00e1, stood out as leader. Angelim had migrated to the province of Gr\u00e3o-Par\u00e1 after a great drought in his home province and was then 21 years old.[23]\nCalled cabanos, the rebels had the goal of restoring Par\u00e1 to Brazil, defending Pedro II as monarch and fighting foreigners. The result of five years of fighting, in which the loyalists won, was the death of an estimated 20% of the local population of the province, its economic destructuring and the destruction of the capital.[23]\nThe Ragamuffin War was the largest and longest lasting of the rebellions that broke out during the regency period, even extending beyond it up until 1845.\nIts immediate economic cause was the increase in taxes in the Rio Grande do Sul province, which directly affected ranchers who were already dissatisfied with competition from Argentine and Uruguayan producers.[18]\nOn 20 September 1835, the city of Porto Alegre was taken by rebels. The rebels later proclaimed their independence as the Riograndense Republic. The leader of the rebels, Bento Gon\u00e7alves, was imprisoned and sent to Salvador, from where he managed to escape and return to his province, ruling it in 1837. Under the command of Giuseppe Garibaldi, the Juliana Republic was proclaimed in Santa Catarina, united in a confederation with the Riograndense Republic.[18]\nThe regencies were not able to put an end to this uprising. It was only defeated during the Second Reign, when emperor Pedro II was already of age.\nThe rebellion began in Salvador, on 7 November 1837, and was named after one of its leaders, the doctor Francisco Sabino. It achieved initial success, after the uprising that began at the S\u00e3o Pedro fort, which spread to the other garrisons, causing the authorities to flee, including the president of the province, Francisco de Sousa Para\u00edso.[24]\nA provisional government was then formed, within the context of a Bahian Republic, which however would be interim until the emperor Pedro II came of age. This provoked controversies among historians about the actual liberal and republican character of the movement.[25]\nThe government remained inoperative, under the presidency of vice-governor Jo\u00e3o Carneiro da Silva Rego; at the beginning of January of the following year their positions were being lost, until the final defeat with the military occupation of the city on March 13, which lasted until shortly after the emperor was declared of age.[24] About 1,800 rebels died, after the hand-to-hand fights.[26]\nThe movement that took place in Maranh\u00e3o had an economic cause: the crisis in cotton production, which came to erupt in a revolt of slaves and cattle herders from the large farms, in December 1838, with the support of the urban liberals, who opposed the landowners.[27]\nHaving as its main leader Manuel Francisco dos Anjos Ferreira, a basket (Portuguese: balaio) maker, from which it gained its name. In 1839, the rebels took over the city of Caxias, while the escaped slaves settled in quilombos in the jungle. The confrontations lasted for 3 years, causing enormous damage to the farmers, but they remained without a common political leader to organize them, being finally defeated by the reaction of the elites, with the support of imperial troops under the command of then colonel Lu\u00eds Alves de Lima e Silva, future Duke of Caxias.[27]\nThe Executive power in the Regency had inherited the existing structure for the ministerial body from the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves, with changes made shortly before independence, or shortly after it.\nIn 1808, when the Portuguese court fled to Brazil, there were only 3 ministries: the Kingdom (which took care of the treasury), the Navy and Overseas, and that of War and Foreigners.[28]\nBy the decree of 22 April 1821, foreign affairs began to be housed in the Ministry of the Kingdom, while the Ministry of Overseas became the new Ministry of the Navy; the same decree also created the Finance ministry, increasing the total to 4: Kingdom and Foreigners, War, Navy and Finance.[28]\nThe Ministry of Justice was created in a letter of law of August 23 of that same year, dismembered from the ministry of the Kingdom, increasing the number of ministries to 5 - a number that was initially maintained at the time of independence, in 1822, changing the name of the Kingdom Ministry to Empire. However, on 13 November 1823, the ministry of Foreigners was separated as an autonomous ministry from the Empire.[28]\nSix, therefore, were the ministries that made up the government during the regencies, which were composed of a total of 13 cabinets for the duration of the regency.[28]\nThe regency period kept in its core the seeds of the two parties that would succeed each other in power during the reign of emperor Pedro II: the Conservative - composed mostly of magistrates, bureaucrats, large Portuguese-majority merchants and rural landowners from states such as Bahia, Rio de Janeiro and Pernambuco - and the Liberal, formed mainly by some priests, the urban middle class and landowners from provinces such as Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul.[23]\nThese two currents emerged during the election to choose a sole regent, with two opposing candidacies. Alongside Diogo Ant\u00f4nio Feij\u00f3 were the exalted liberals and part of the moderates; the candidate Holanda Cavalcanti was joined by part of the moderates, the former restorers allied to the Andrada brothers, led by Bernardo de Vasconcelos, from Minas Gerais.[18]\nThe liberals won the government with Feij\u00f3, while the conservatives succeeded him with Ara\u00fajo Lima, when the liberals achieved success with the declaration of age of emperor Pedro II.[18]\nA local romanticism movement began to gain attraction in Brazil during the regency period, under European influence, but keeping local elements. It sought to create a literature with typically local figures, such as the amerindians.[18]\nThe inaugural \"landmark\" of Brazilian romanticism belongs to Gon\u00e7alves de Magalh\u00e3es with the publication, in 1836, of the compilation of poems Suspiros Po\u00e9ticos e Saudades, in the middle of the regency period.[29]\nMagalh\u00e3es produced dramatic texts, while others such as Martins Pena dedicated themselves with greater emphasis to theater and the comedy of manners, in which the actor Jo\u00e3o Caetano, creator of a theater company at the Court, stood out. The public initially reacted negatively to these plays, which denounced British dominance in the local economy, corruption and social abuses.[18]\nEducation already had, in 1827, a General Law, which established the creation of primary schools in all villages, establishing the salary for the teachers and the subjects to be taught; the Additional Act of 1834 decentralized school administration: the provinces would be responsible for elementary and secondary education and the Crown would be responsible for higher education. It was in this context that the Col\u00e9gio Pedro II was founded.[30]\nAlthough the death penalty existed throughout the imperial period, it was during the regency that it was most widely carried out; The Criminal Code, approved in 1830, and the Criminal Procedure Code, of 1832, treated free men and slaves alike, but in 1835, the Carrancas Revolt, which took place two years earlier in Minas Gerais, caused a law to be passed on the 10th of June that made the situation of slaves different.[31]\nThe new law allowed capital punishment to be applied by a decision of two thirds of the jurors and no longer the unanimity required by the codes, for crimes exclusively committed by slaves (such as murdering, poisoning or harming the master, his wife, ascendants or descendants, the administrator, the overseer, etc. or participating in an insurrection); the penalty could not be appealed.[31]\nAlthough the Moderating power allowed the ruler to commute the death penalty to another, this almost never occurred during the regency period, with the result that it was at this time that prisoners in Brazil were most easily executed, most of them slaves.[31]\nThe press experienced a growth hitherto unseen in Brazil. In 1837 Manuel de Ara\u00fajo Porto-Alegre published the first caricature in Brazil, portraying the disputes that took place within the regencies; the lithograph shows Justiniano Jos\u00e9 da Rocha,[32] a journalist who was hired for a large salary to be the editor of the Correio Oficial and, in the engraving, appears on his knees receiving a bag of money from the governor.[33]\nIn Recife, the newspaper O Carapuceiro, which circulated from 1832 to 1942, is a paradigm of the press of the period, especially in the provinces. There social criticism, as well as political criticism, in which the declared objective was to publish their observations that would serve as a hood to whomever they could, were published; its editor and redactor, Miguel do Sacramento Lopes Gama, would go down in history by the nickname of Father Carapuceiro.[34]\nAlthough in Europe the growth of print runs made it possible in the 1830s to create literary and scientific magazines, and the publication of novels in periodicals,[c] this phenomenon still lingered in the Brazil, where newspapers were, before, engaged in the political disputes between the parties and factions in formation - and this type of publication only came to light in the country when these disputes settled down, during the Second Reign: until then, political disputes and the partisanship of the press prevailed.[35]\nThe press of the time, therefore, had as its main objective the formation of opinion, intervening directly in political life. An exception was the magazine Niter\u00f3i, edited in France by Francisco de Sales Torres Homem, Gon\u00e7alves de Magalh\u00e3es and Manuel de Ara\u00fajo Porto-Alegre, in 1836, whose declared purpose was to show Brazilian literature, arts and economy. It is considered a precursor of romanticism in Brazil.[35]\nA noteworthy fact is the existence of newspapers aimed at blacks and mestizos, which appeared during the Permanent Regency, whose titles made clear the public they were addressed to: O Crioulinho, O Homem de Cor ou o Mulato and O Brasileiro Pardo, which discussed racial issues.[20]", "links":

*bant\u028a\u0300)[1][2] are a language family of about 600 languages that are spoken by the Bantu peoples of Central, Southern, Eastern and Southeast Africa. They form the largest branch of the Southern Bantoid languages.\nThe total number of Bantu languages is estimated at between 440 and 680 distinct languages, depending on the definition of \"language\" versus \"dialect\".[3] Many Bantu languages borrow words from each other, and some are mutually intelligible.[4]\nThe total number of Bantu speakers is estimated to be around 350 million in 2015 (roughly 30% of the population of Africa or 5% of the world population).[5] Bantu languages are largely spoken southeast of Cameroon, and throughout Central, Southern, Eastern, and Southeast Africa. About one-sixth of Bantu speakers, and one-third of Bantu languages, are found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nThe most widely spoken Bantu language by number of speakers is Swahili, with 16 million native speakers and 80 million L2 speakers (2015).[6] Most native speakers of Swahili live in Tanzania, where it is a national language, while as a second language it is taught as a mandatory subject in many schools in East Africa, and is a lingua franca of the East African Community.\nOther major Bantu languages include Zulu with 12 million speakers (South Africa and Zimbabwe), Xhosa with 8.2 million speakers, and Shona with less than 10 million speakers (if Manyika and Ndau are included). Zimbabwe has Kalanga, Matebele, Nambiya and Zulu speakers.[7][8] Ethnologue separates the largely mutually intelligible Kinyarwanda and Kirundi, which together have 20 million speakers.[9]\nThe similarity among dispersed Bantu languages had been observed as early as the 17th century.[10] The term Bantu as a name for the group was coined (as B\u00e2-ntu) by Wilhelm Bleek in 1857 or 1858, and popularized in his Comparative Grammar of 1862.[11] He coined the term to represent the word for \"people\" in loosely reconstructed Proto-Bantu, from the plural noun class prefix *ba- categorizing \"people\", and the root *nt\u028a\u0300- \"some (entity), any\" (e.g. Zulu umuntu \"person\", abantu \"people\").\nThere is no indigenous term for the group, as Bantu-speaking populations refer to themselves by their endonyms, but did not have a concept for the larger ethno-linguistic phylum. Bleek's coinage was inspired by the anthropological observation of groups frequently self-identifying as \"people\" or \"the true people\" (as is the case, for example, with the term Khoikhoi, but this is a kare \"praise address\" and not an ethnic name).[12]\nThe term narrow Bantu, excluding those languages classified as Bantoid by Guthrie (1948), was introduced in the 1960s.[13]\nThe prefix ba- specifically refers to people. Endonymically, the term for cultural objects, including language, is formed with the ki- noun class (Nguni \u00edsi-), as in KiSwahili (Swahili language and culture), IsiZulu (Zulu language and culture) and KiGanda (Ganda religion and culture).\nIn the 1980s, South African linguists suggested referring to these languages as KiNtu. The word kintu exists in some places, but it means \"thing\", with no relation to the concept of \"language\".[14] In addition, delegates at the African Languages Association of Southern Africa conference in 1984 reported that, in some places, the term Kintu has a derogatory significance.[15] This is because kintu refers to \"things\" and is used as a dehumanizing term for people who have lost their dignity.[16]\nIn addition, Kintu is a figure in some mythologies.[17]\nIn the 1990s, the term Kintu was still occasionally used by South African linguists.[18] But in contemporary decolonial South African linguistics, the term Ntu languages is used.[18]\nThe Bantu languages descend from a common Proto-Bantu language, which is believed to have been spoken in what is now Cameroon in Central Africa.[19] An estimated 2,500\u20133,000 years ago (1000 BC to 500 BC), speakers of the Proto-Bantu language began a series of migrations eastward and southward, carrying agriculture with them. This Bantu expansion came to dominate Sub-Saharan Africa east of Cameroon, an area where Bantu peoples now constitute nearly the entire population.[19][20] Some other sources estimate the Bantu Expansion started closer to 3000 BC.[21]\nThe technical term Bantu, meaning \"human beings\" or simply \"people\", was first used by Wilhelm Bleek (1827\u20131875), as the concept is reflected in many of the languages of this group. A common characteristic of Bantu languages is that they use words such as muntu or mutu for \"human being\" or in simplistic terms \"person\", and the plural prefix for human nouns starting with mu- (class 1) in most languages is ba- (class 2), thus giving bantu for \"people\". Bleek, and later Carl Meinhof, pursued extensive studies comparing the grammatical structures of Bantu languages.\nThe most widely used classification is an alphanumeric coding system developed by Malcolm Guthrie in his 1948 classification of the Bantu languages. It is mainly geographic. The term \"narrow Bantu\" was coined by the Benue\u2013Congo Working Group to distinguish Bantu as recognized by Guthrie, from the Bantoid languages not recognized as Bantu by Guthrie.[22]\nIn recent times,[when?] the distinctiveness of Narrow Bantu as opposed to the other Southern Bantoid languages has been called into doubt (cf. Piron 1995, Williamson & Blench 2000, Blench 2011), but the term is still widely used.\nThere is no true genealogical classification of the (Narrow) Bantu languages. Until recently[when?] most attempted classifications only considered languages that happen to fall within traditional Narrow Bantu, but there seems to be a continuum with the related languages of South Bantoid.[23]\nAt a broader level, the family is commonly split in two depending on the reflexes of proto-Bantu tone patterns:  Many Bantuists group together parts of zones A through D (the extent depending on the author) as Northwest Bantu or Forest Bantu, and the remainder as Central Bantu or Savanna Bantu. The two groups have been described as having mirror-image tone systems: where Northwest Bantu has a high tone in a cognate, Central Bantu languages generally have a low tone, and vice versa.\nNorthwest Bantu is more divergent internally than Central Bantu, and perhaps less conservative due to contact with non-Bantu Niger\u2013Congo languages; Central Bantu is likely the innovative line cladistically. Northwest Bantu is clearly not a coherent family, but even for Central Bantu the evidence is lexical, with little evidence that it is a historically valid group.\nAnother attempt at a detailed genetic classification to replace the Guthrie system is the 1999 \"Tervuren\" proposal of Bastin, Coupez, and Mann.[24] However, it relies on lexicostatistics, which, because of its reliance on overall similarity rather than shared innovations, may predict spurious groups of conservative languages that are not closely related. Meanwhile, Ethnologue has added languages to the Guthrie classification which Guthrie overlooked, while removing the Mbam languages (much of zone A), and shifting some languages between groups (much of zones D and E to a new zone J, for example, and part of zone L to K, and part of M to F) in an apparent effort at a semi-genetic, or at least semi-areal, classification. This has been criticized for sowing confusion in one of the few unambiguous ways to distinguish Bantu languages. Nurse & Philippson (2006) evaluate many proposals for low-level groups of Bantu languages, but the result is not a complete portrayal of the family.[22][11] Glottolog has incorporated many of these into their classification.[25]\nThe languages that share Dahl's law may also form a valid group, Northeast Bantu. The infobox at right lists these together with various low-level groups that are fairly uncontroversial, though they continue to be revised. The development of a rigorous genealogical classification of many branches of Niger\u2013Congo, not just Bantu, is hampered by insufficient data.[26][13]\nSimplified phylogeny of northwestern branches of Bantu by Grollemund (2012):[27]\nA40-50-60-70: Basaa languages, Bafia languages, Mbam languages, Beti language\nA10-20-30: Sawabantu languages, Manenguba languages\nA80-90: Makaa\u2013Njem languages\nB20: Kele languages\nB10: Myene language\nB30: Tsogo languages\nC10-20-30: Ngondi\u2013Ngiri languages, Mboshi languages, Bangi\u2013Ntomba languages\nC40-D20-D32: Bati\u2013Angba languages, Lega\u2013Binja languages, Bira language\nB80-C60-70-80: Boma\u2013Dzing languages, Soko languages, Tetela languages, Bushoong languages\nB40-H10-30-B50-60-70: Sira languages, Kongo languages, Yaka languages, Nzebi languages, Mbete languages, Teke languages\nL10-H40: Pende languages, Hungana language\nC50-D10: Soko languages, Lengola language\nD10-20-30-40-JD50: Mbole\u2013Enya languages, Komo\u2013Bira languages, Shi\u2013Havu languages\nOther computational phylogenetic analyses of Bantu include Currie et al. (2013),[28] Grollemund et al. (2015),[29] Rexova et al. 2006,[30] Holden et al., 2016,[31] and Whiteley et al. 2018.[32]\nGlottolog (2021) does not consider the older geographic classification by Guthrie relevant for its ongoing classification based on more recent linguistic studies, and Divides Bantu into four main branches (Bantu A-B10-B20-B30, Central-Western Bantu, East Bantu and Mbam-Bube-Jarawan).[33]\nGuthrie reconstructed both the phonemic inventory and the vocabulary of Proto-Bantu.[3]\nThe most prominent grammatical characteristic of Bantu languages is the extensive use of affixes (see Sotho grammar and Ganda noun classes for detailed discussions of these affixes). Each noun belongs to a class, and each language may have several numbered classes, somewhat like grammatical gender in European languages. The class is indicated by a prefix that is part of the noun, as well as agreement markers on verb and qualificative roots connected with the noun. Plural is indicated by a change of class, with a resulting change of prefix.[18][13] All Bantu languages are agglutinative.\nThe verb has a number of prefixes, though in the western languages these are often treated as independent words.[34] In Swahili, for example, Mtoto mdogo amekisoma (for comparison, Kamwana kadoko karikuverenga in Shona language) means 'The small child has read it [a book]'. Mtoto 'child' governs the adjective prefix m- (representing the diminutive form of the word) and the verb subject prefix a-. Then comes perfect tense -me- and an object marker -ki- agreeing with implicit kitabu 'book' (from Arabic kitab). Pluralizing to 'children' gives Watoto wadogo wamekisoma (Vana vadoko varikuverenga in Shona), and pluralizing to 'books' (vitabu) gives watoto wadogo wamevisoma.[21]\nBantu words are typically made up of open syllables of the type CV (consonant-vowel) with most languages having syllables exclusively of this type. The Bushong language recorded by Vansina, however, has final consonants,[35] while slurring of the final syllable (though written) is reported as common among the Tonga of Malawi.[36] The morphological shape of Bantu words is typically CV, VCV, CVCV, VCVCV, etc.; that is, any combination of CV (with possibly a V- syllable at the start). In other words, a strong claim for this language family is that almost all words end in a vowel, precisely because closed syllables (CVC) are not permissible in most of the documented languages, as far as is understood.[37][23]\nThis tendency to avoid consonant clusters in some positions is important when words are imported from English or other non-Bantu languages. An example from Chewa: the word \"school\", borrowed from English, and then transformed to fit the sound patterns of this language, is sukulu. That is, sk- has been broken up by inserting an epenthetic -u-; -u has also been added at the end of the word. Another example is buledi for \"bread\". Similar effects are seen in loanwords for other non-African CV languages like Japanese. However, a clustering of sounds at the beginning of a syllable can be readily observed in such languages as Shona,[38] and the Makua languages.[39]\nWith few exceptions, such as Kiswahili and Rutooro, Bantu languages are tonal and have two to four register tones.\nReduplication is a common morphological phenomenon in Bantu languages and is usually used to indicate frequency or intensity of the action signalled by the (unreduplicated) verb stem.[37]\nWell-known words and names that have reduplication include:\nRepetition emphasizes the repeated word in the context that it is used. For instance, \"Mwenda pole hajikwai,\" while, \"Pole pole ndio mwendo,\" has two to emphasize the consistency of slowness of the pace. The meaning of the former in translation is, \"He who goes slowly doesn't trip,\" and that of the latter is, \"A slow but steady pace wins the race.\" Haraka haraka would mean hurrying just for the sake of hurrying, reckless hurry, as in \"Njoo! Haraka haraka\" [come here! Hurry, hurry].\nIn contrast, there are some words in some of the languages in which reduplication has the opposite meaning. It usually denotes short durations, and or lower intensity of the action and also means a few repetitions or a little bit more.\nThe following is a list of nominal classes in Bantu languages:[40]\nVirtually all Bantu languages have a Subject\u2013verb\u2013object word order with some exceptions such as \nthe Nen language which has a Subject-Object-Verb word order.[41]\nFollowing is an incomplete list of the principal Bantu languages of each country.[42] Included are those languages that constitute at least 1% of the population and have at least 10% the number of speakers of the largest Bantu language in the country.\nMost languages are referred to in English without the class prefix (Swahili, Tswana, Ndebele), but are sometimes seen with the (language-specific) prefix (Kiswahili, Setswana, Sindebele). In a few cases prefixes are used to distinguish languages with the same root in their name, such as Tshiluba and Kiluba (both Luba), Umbundu and Kimbundu (both Mbundu). The prefixless form typically does not occur in the language itself, but is the basis for other words based on the ethnicity. So, in the country of Botswana the people are the Batswana, one person is a Motswana, and the language is Setswana; and in Uganda, centred on the kingdom of Buganda, the dominant ethnicity are the Baganda (singular Muganda), whose language is Luganda.\nLingua franca\nAngola\nBotswana\nBurundi\nCameroon\nCentral African Republic\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo\nEquatorial Guinea\nEswatini (formerly Swaziland)\nGabon\nKenya\nLesotho\nMalawi\nMozambique\nNamibia\nNigeria\nRepublic of the Congo (Congo-Brazzaville)\nRwanda\nSomalia\nSouth Africa\nAccording to the South African National Census of 2011[43][full citation needed]\nTanzania\nUganda\nZambia\nZimbabwe\nMap 1 shows Bantu languages in Africa and map 2 a magnification of the Benin, Nigeria and Cameroon area, as of July 2017.[citation needed]\nA case has been made out for borrowings of many place-names and even misremembered rhymes \u2013 chiefly from one of the Luba varieties \u2013 in the USA.[44]\nSome words from various Bantu languages have been borrowed into western languages. These include:\nAlong with the Latin script and Arabic script orthographies, there are also some modern indigenous writing systems used for Bantu languages:", "links":
