{"Scotland - Wikipedia": {"text": "\u2013\u00a0in Europe\u00a0(green &\u00a0dark grey)\u2013\u00a0in the United Kingdom\u00a0(green)\nScotland (Scots: Scotland, Scottish Gaelic: Alba [\u02c8al\u032a\u02e0ap\u0259] (listen)) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom.[16] Covering the northern third of the island of Great Britain,[17][18][19] mainland Scotland has a 96-mile (154-kilometre) border with England to the southeast and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the north and west, the North Sea to the northeast and east, and the Irish Sea to the south. It also contains more than 790 islands,[20] principally in the archipelagos of the Hebrides and the Northern Isles. Most of the population, including the capital Edinburgh, is concentrated in the Central Belt\u2014the plain between the Scottish Highlands and the Southern Uplands\u2014in the Scottish Lowlands.\nScotland is divided into 32 administrative subdivisions or local authorities, known as council areas.[21] Glasgow City is the largest council area in terms of population, with Highland being the largest in terms of area. Limited self-governing power, covering matters such as education, social services and roads and transportation, is devolved from the Scottish Government to each subdivision.[21] Scotland is the second-largest country in the United Kingdom, and accounted for 8.3% of the population in 2012.[22]\nThe Kingdom of Scotland emerged in the 9th century, from the merging of the Gaelic Kingdom of D\u00e1l Riata and the Kingdom of the Picts, and continued to exist as an independent sovereign state until 1707. By inheritance in 1603, James VI of Scotland became king of England and Ireland, thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms. Scotland subsequently entered into a political union with the Kingdom of England on 1 May 1707 to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain.[23][24] The union also created the Parliament of Great Britain, which succeeded both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England. In 1801, the Kingdom of Great Britain entered into a political union with the Kingdom of Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (in 1922, the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom, leading to the latter being officially renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1927).[25]\nWithin Scotland, the monarchy of the United Kingdom has continued to use a variety of styles, titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to the pre-union Kingdom of Scotland. The legal system within Scotland has also remained separate from those of England and Wales and Northern Ireland; Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in both public and private law.[26] The continued existence of legal, educational, religious and other institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the UK have all contributed to the continuation of Scottish culture and national identity since the 1707 incorporating union with England.[27]\nIn 1999, a Scottish Parliament was re-established, in the form of a devolved unicameral legislature comprising 129 members, having authority over many areas of domestic policy.[28] The head of the Scottish Government is the first minister, who is supported by the deputy first minister.[29] Scotland is represented in the United Kingdom Parliament by 59 members of parliament (MPs). It is also a member of the British\u2013Irish Council,[30] sending five members of the Scottish Parliament to the British\u2013Irish Parliamentary Assembly,[31] as well as being part of the Heads of Government Council, represented by the first minister,[32] and the \nInter-ministerial Standing Committee Council, represented by relevant cabinet secretaries and ministers in areas relating to education, finance and economy, environment and trade and investment.[33]\nScotland comes from Scoti, the Latin name for the Gaels. Philip Freeman has speculated on the likelihood of a group of raiders adopting a name from an Indo-European root, *skot, citing the parallel in Greek skotos (\u03c3\u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2), meaning \"darkness, gloom\".[34] The Late Latin word Scotia ('land of the Gaels') was initially used to refer to Ireland,[35] and likewise in early Old English Scotland was used for Ireland.[36] By the 11th century at the latest, Scotia was being used to refer to (Gaelic-speaking) Scotland north of the River Forth, alongside Albania or Albany, both derived from the Gaelic Alba.[37] The use of the words Scots and Scotland to encompass all of what is now Scotland became common in the Late Middle Ages.[23]\nRepeated glaciations, which covered the entire land mass of modern Scotland, destroyed any traces of human habitation that may have existed before the Mesolithic period. It is believed the first post-glacial groups of hunter-gatherers arrived in Scotland around 12,800 years ago, as the ice sheet retreated after the last glaciation.[38] At the time, Scotland was covered in forests, had more bog-land, and the main form of transport was by water.[39]:\u200a9\u200a These settlers began building the first known permanent houses on Scottish soil around 9,500 years ago, and the first villages around 6,000 years ago. The well-preserved village of Skara Brae on the mainland of Orkney dates from this period. Neolithic habitation, burial, and ritual sites are particularly common and well preserved in the Northern Isles and Western Isles, where a lack of trees led to most structures being built of local stone.[40] Evidence of sophisticated pre-Christian belief systems is demonstrated by sites such as the Callanish Stones on Lewis and the Maes Howe on Orkney, which were built in the third millennium BC.[41]:\u200a38\nThe first written reference to Scotland was in 320 BC by Greek sailor Pytheas, who called the northern tip of Britain \"Orcas\", the source of the name of the Orkney islands.[39]:\u200a10\u200a During the first millennium BC, the society changed dramatically to a chiefdom model, as consolidation of settlement led to the concentration of wealth and underground stores of surplus food.[39]:\u200a11\nThe Roman conquest of Britain was never completed, and most of modern Scotland was not brought under Roman political control.[42] The first Roman incursion into Scotland occurred in 79 AD, when Agricola invaded Scotland; he defeated a Caledonian army at the Battle of Mons Graupius in 83 AD.[39]:\u200a12\u200a After the Roman victory, Roman forts were briefly set along the Gask Ridge close to the Highland line, but by three years after the battle, the Roman armies had withdrawn to the Southern Uplands.[43] Remains of Roman forts established in the 1st century have been found as far north as the Moray Firth.[42] By the reign of the Roman emperor Trajan (r.\u00a098\u2013117), Roman control had lapsed to Britain south of a line between the River Tyne and the Solway Firth.[44] Along this line, Trajan's successor Hadrian (r.\u00a0117\u2013138) erected Hadrian's Wall in northern England[39]:\u200a12\u200a and the Limes Britannicus became the northern border of the Roman Empire.[45][46] The Roman influence on the southern part of the country was considerable, and they introduced Christianity to Scotland.[39]:\u200a13\u201314\u200a[41]:\u200a38\nThe Antonine Wall was built from 142 at the order of Hadrian's successor Antoninus Pius (r.\u00a0138\u2013161), defending the Roman part of Scotland from the unadministered part of the island, north of a line between the Firth of Clyde and the Firth of Forth. The Roman invasion of Caledonia 208\u2013210 was undertaken by emperors of the imperial Severan dynasty in response to the breaking of treaty by the Caledonians in 197,[42] but permanent conquest of the whole of Great Britain was forestalled by Roman forces becoming bogged down in punishing guerrilla warfare and the death of the senior emperor Septimius Severus (r.\u00a0193\u2013211) at Eboracum (York) after taking ill while on campaign. Although forts erected by the Roman army of the Severan campaign were placed near those established by Agricola and were clustered at the mouths of the glens in the Highlands, the Caledonians were again in revolt in 210\u2013211 and these were overrun.[42]\nTo the Roman historians Tacitus and Cassius Dio, the Scottish Highlands and the area north of the River Forth was called Caledonia.[42] According to Cassius Dio, the inhabitants of Caledonia were the Caledonians and the Maeatae.[42] Other ancient authors used the adjective \"Caledonian\" to pertain to anywhere in northern or inland Britain, often mentioning the region's people and animals, its cold climate, its pearls, and a noteworthy region of wooden hills (Latin: saltus) which the 2nd-century AD Roman philosopher Ptolemy, in his Geography, described as being south-west of the Beauly Firth.[42] The name Caledonia is echoed in the place names of Dunkeld, Rohallion, and Schiehallion.[42]\nThe Great Conspiracy constituted a seemingly coordinated invasion against Roman rule in Britain in the later 4th century, which included the participation of the Gaelic Scoti and the Caledonians, who were then known as Picts by the Romans. This was defeated by the comes Theodosius, however, Roman military government was withdrawn from the island altogether by the early 5th century, resulting in the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain and the immigration of the Saxons to southeastern Scotland and the rest of eastern Great Britain.[44]\nBeginning in the sixth century, the area that is now Scotland was divided into three areas: Pictland, a patchwork of small lordships in central Scotland;[39]:\u200a25\u201326\u200a the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Northumbria, which had conquered southeastern Scotland;[39]:\u200a18\u201320\u200a and D\u00e1l Riata, which included territory in western Scotland and northern Ireland, and spread Gaelic language and culture into Scotland.[47] These societies were based on the family unit and had sharp divisions in wealth, although the vast majority were poor and worked full-time in subsistence agriculture. The Picts kept slaves (mostly captured in war) through the ninth century.[39]:\u200a26\u201327\nGaelic influence over Pictland and Northumbria was facilitated by the large number of Gaelic-speaking clerics working as missionaries.[39]:\u200a23\u201324\u200a Operating in the sixth century on the island of Iona, Saint Columba was one of the earliest and best-known missionaries.[41]:\u200a39\u200a The Vikings began to raid Scotland in the eighth century. Although the raiders sought slaves and luxury items, their main motivation was to acquire land. The oldest Norse settlements were in northwest Scotland, but they eventually conquered many areas along the coast. Old Norse entirely displaced Gaelic in the Northern Isles.[39]:\u200a29\u201330\nIn the ninth century, the Norse threat allowed a Gael named Cin\u00e1ed mac Ailp\u00edn (Kenneth I) to seize power over Pictland, establishing a royal dynasty to which the modern monarchs trace their lineage, and marking the beginning of the end of Pictish culture.[39]:\u200a31\u201332\u200a[48] The kingdom of Cin\u00e1ed and his descendants, called Alba, was Gaelic in character but existed on the same area as Pictland. By the end of the tenth century, the Pictish language went extinct as its speakers shifted to Gaelic.[39]:\u200a32\u201333\u200a From a base in eastern Scotland north of the River Forth and south of the River Spey, the kingdom expanded first southwards, into the former Northumbrian lands, and northwards into Moray.[39]:\u200a34\u201335\u200a Around the turn of the millennium, there was a centralization in agricultural lands and the first towns began to be established.[39]:\u200a36\u201337\nIn the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, much of Scotland was under the control of a single ruler. Initially, Gaelic culture predominated, but immigrants from France, England and Flanders steadily created a more diverse society, with the Gaelic language starting to be replaced by Scots. Altogether, a modern nation-state emerged from this. At the end of this period, war against England started the growth of a Scottish national consciousness.[49]:\u200a37-39\u200a[50]:\u200ach 1\u200a David I (1124\u20131153) and his successors centralized royal power[49]:\u200a41\u201342\u200a and united mainland Scotland, capturing regions such as Moray, Galloway, and Caithness, although he did not succeed at extending his power over the Hebrides, which had been ruled by various Scottish clans following the death of Somerled in 1164.[49]:\u200a48\u201349\u200a The system of feudalism was consolidated, with both Anglo-Norman incomers and native Gaelic chieftains being granted land in exchange for serving the king.[49]:\u200a53\u201354\u200a The complex relationship with Scotland's southern neighbour over this period is characterised by Scottish kings making successful and unsuccessful attempts to exploit English political turmoil, followed by the longest period of peace between Scotland and England in the mediaeval period: from 1217\u20131296.[49]:\u200a45-46\nThe death of Alexander III in March 1286 broke the succession line of Scotland's kings. Edward I of England arbitrated between various claimants for the Scottish crown. In return for surrendering Scotland's nominal independence, John Balliol was pronounced king in 1292.[49]:\u200a47\u200a[51] In 1294, Balliol and other Scottish lords refused Edward's demands to serve in his army against the French. Scotland and France sealed a treaty on 23 October 1295, known as the Auld Alliance. War ensued, and John was deposed by Edward who took personal control of Scotland. Andrew Moray and William Wallace initially emerged as the principal leaders of the resistance to English rule in the Wars of Scottish Independence,[52] until Robert the Bruce was crowned king of Scotland in 1306.[53] Victory at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 proved the Scots had regained control of their kingdom. In 1320 the world's first documented declaration of independence, the Declaration of Arbroath, won the support of Pope John XXII, leading to the legal recognition of Scottish sovereignty by the English Crown.\n[54]:\u200a70,\u200a72\nA civil war between the Bruce dynasty and their long-term rivals of the House of Comyn and House of Balliol lasted until the middle of the 14th century. Although the Bruce faction was successful, David II's lack of an heir allowed his half-nephew Robert II, the Lord High Steward of Scotland, to come to the throne and establish the House of Stewart.[54]:\u200a77\u200a The Stewarts ruled Scotland for the remainder of the Middle Ages. The country they ruled experienced greater prosperity from the end of the 14th century through the Scottish Renaissance to the Reformation,[55]:\u200a93\u200a despite the effects of the Black Death in 1349[54]:\u200a76\u200a and increasing division between Highlands and Lowlands.[54]:\u200a78\u200a Multiple truces reduced warfare on the southern border.[54]:\u200a76,\u200a83\nThe Treaty of Perpetual Peace was signed in 1502 by James IV of Scotland and Henry VII of England. James married Henry's daughter, Margaret Tudor.[56] James invaded England in support of France under the terms of the Auld Alliance and became the last British monarch to die in battle, at Flodden in 1513.[57] The war with England during the minority years of Mary, Queen of Scots between 1543 to 1551 is known as the Rough Wooing.[58]\nIn 1560, the Treaty of Edinburgh brought an end to the Siege of Leith and recognized the Protestant Elizabeth I as Queen of England.[55]:\u200a112\u200a The Parliament of Scotland met and immediately adopted the Scots Confession, which signalled the Scottish Reformation's sharp break from papal authority and Roman Catholic teaching.[41]:\u200a44\u200a The Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots, was forced to abdicate in 1567.[59]\nIn 1603, James VI, King of Scots inherited the thrones of the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Ireland in the Union of the Crowns, and moved to London.[60] The first Union Jack was designed at James's behest, to be flown in addition to the St Andrew's Cross on Scots vessels at sea. James VI and I intended to create a single kingdom of Great Britain, but was thwarted in his attempt to do so by the Parliament of England, which supported the wrecking proposal that a full legal union be sought instead, a proposal to which the Scots Parliament would not assent, causing the king to withdraw the plan.[61]\nWith the exception of a short period under the Protectorate, Scotland remained a separate state in the 17th century, but there was considerable conflict between the crown and the Covenanters over the form of church government.[62]:\u200a124\u200a The military was strengthened, allowing the imposition of royal authority on the western Highland clans. The 1609 Statutes of Iona compelled the cultural integration of Hebridean clan leaders.[63]:\u200a37\u201340\u200a In 1641 and again in 1643, the Parliament of Scotland unsuccessfully sought a union with England which was \"federative\" and not \"incorporating\", in which Scotland would retain a separate parliament.[64] The issue of union split the parliament in 1648.[64]\nAfter the execution of the Scottish king at Whitehall in 1649, amid the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and its events in Scotland, Oliver Cromwell, the victorious Lord Protector, imposed the British Isles' first written constitution \u2013 the Instrument of Government \u2013 on Scotland in 1652 as part of the republican Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland.[64] The Protectorate Parliament was the first Westminster parliament to include representatives nominally from Scotland. The monarchy of the House of Stuart was resumed with the Restoration in Scotland in 1660.\nThe Parliament of Scotland sought a commercial union with England in 1664; the proposal was rejected in 1668.[64] In 1670 the Parliament of England rejected a proposed political union with Scotland.[64] English proposals along the same lines were abandoned in 1674 and in 1685.[64] The Battle of Altimarlach in 1680 was the last significant clan battle fought between highland clans.[65] After the fall and flight into exile of the Catholic Stuart king, James VII and II the Glorious Revolution in Scotland and the Convention of Estates replaced the House of Stuart in favour of William III and Mary II who was Mary Stuart.[62]:\u200a142\u200a The Scots Parliament rejected proposals for a political union in 1689.[64] Jacobitism, the political support for the exiled Catholic Stuart dynasty, remained a threat to the security of the British state under the Protestant House of Orange and the succeeding House of Hanover until the defeat of the Jacobite rising of 1745.[64]\nIn common with countries such as France, Norway, Sweden and Finland, Scotland experienced famines during the 1690s. Mortality, reduced childbirths and increased emigration reduced the population of parts of the country about 10\u201315%.[66] In 1698, the Company of Scotland attempted a project to secure a trading colony on the Isthmus of Panama. Almost every Scottish landowner who had money to spare is said to have invested in the Darien scheme.[67][68]\nAfter another proposal from the English House of Lords was rejected in 1695, and a further Lords motion was voted down in the House of Commons in 1700, the Parliament of Scotland again rejected union in 1702.[64] The failure of the Darien Scheme bankrupted the landowners who had invested, though not the burghs. Nevertheless, the nobles' bankruptcy, along with the threat of an English invasion, played a leading role in convincing the Scots elite to back a union with England.[67][68] On 22 July 1706, the Treaty of Union was agreed between representatives of the Scots Parliament and the Parliament of England. The following year, twin Acts of Union were passed by both parliaments to create the united Kingdom of Great Britain with effect from 1 May 1707[24] with popular opposition and anti-union riots in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and elsewhere.[69][70] The newly formed Parliament of Great Britain rejected proposals from the Parliament of Ireland that the third kingdom be incorporated in the union.[64]\nWith trade tariffs with England abolished, trade blossomed, especially with Colonial America. The clippers belonging to the Glasgow Tobacco Lords were the fastest ships on the route to Virginia. Until the American War of Independence in 1776, Glasgow was the world's premier tobacco port, dominating world trade.[71] The disparity between the wealth of the merchant classes of the Scottish Lowlands and the ancient clans of the Scottish Highlands grew, amplifying centuries of division.\nThe deposed Jacobite Stuart claimants had remained popular in the Highlands and north-east, particularly amongst non-Presbyterians, including Roman Catholics and Episcopalian Protestants. Two major Jacobite risings launched in 1715 and 1745 failed to remove the House of Hanover from the British throne. The threat of the Jacobite movement to the United Kingdom and its monarchs effectively ended at the Battle of Culloden, Great Britain's last pitched battle.\nIn the Highlands, clan chiefs gradually started to think of themselves more as commercial landlords than leaders of their people. These social and economic changes included the first phase of the Highland Clearances and, ultimately, the demise of clanship.[72]:\u200a32\u201353,\u200apassim\nThe Scottish Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution turned Scotland into an intellectual, commercial and industrial powerhouse[73] \u2014 so much so Voltaire said \"We look to Scotland for all our ideas of civilisation.\"[74] With the demise of Jacobitism and the advent of the Union, thousands of Scots, mainly Lowlanders, took up numerous positions of power in politics, civil service, the army and navy, trade, economics, colonial enterprises and other areas across the nascent British Empire. Historian Neil Davidson notes \"after 1746 there was an entirely new level of participation by Scots in political life, particularly outside Scotland.\" Davidson also states \"far from being 'peripheral' to the British economy, Scotland \u2013 or more precisely, the Lowlands \u2013 lay at its core.\"[75]\nThe Scottish Reform Act 1832 increased the number of Scottish MPs and widened the franchise to include more of the middle classes.[76] From the mid-century, there were increasing calls for Home Rule for Scotland and the post of Secretary of State for Scotland was revived.[77] Towards the end of the century Prime Ministers of Scottish descent included William Gladstone,[78] and the Earl of Rosebery.[79] In the late 19th century the growing importance of the working classes was marked by Keir Hardie's success in the Mid Lanarkshire by-election, 1888, leading to the foundation of the Scottish Labour Party, which was absorbed into the Independent Labour Party in 1895, with Hardie as its first leader.[80]\nGlasgow became one of the largest cities in the world and known as \"the Second City of the Empire\" after London.[81] After 1860, the Clydeside shipyards specialised in steamships made of iron (after 1870, made of steel), which rapidly replaced the wooden sailing vessels of both the merchant fleets and the battle fleets of the world. It became the world's pre-eminent shipbuilding centre.[82] The industrial developments, while they brought work and wealth, were so rapid that housing, town-planning, and provision for public health did not keep pace with them, and for a time living conditions in some of the towns and cities were notoriously bad, with overcrowding, high infant mortality, and growing rates of tuberculosis.[83]\nWhile the Scottish Enlightenment is traditionally considered to have concluded toward the end of the 18th century,[84] disproportionately large Scottish contributions to British science and letters continued for another 50 years or more, thanks to such figures as the physicists James Clerk Maxwell and Lord Kelvin, and the engineers and inventors James Watt and William Murdoch, whose work was critical to the technological developments of the Industrial Revolution throughout Britain.[85] In literature, the most successful figure of the mid-19th century was Walter Scott. His first prose work, Waverley in 1814, is often called the first historical novel.[86] It launched a highly successful career that probably more than any other helped define and popularise Scottish cultural identity.[87] In the late 19th century, a number of Scottish-born authors achieved international reputations, such as Robert Louis Stevenson, Arthur Conan Doyle, J. M. Barrie and George MacDonald.[88] Scotland also played a major part in the development of art and architecture. The Glasgow School, which developed in the late 19th century, and flourished in the early 20th century, produced a distinctive blend of influences including the Celtic Revival the Arts and Crafts movement, and Japonism, which found favour throughout the modern art world of continental Europe and helped define the Art Nouveau style. Proponents included architect and artist Charles Rennie Mackintosh.[89]\nThis period saw a process of rehabilitation for Highland culture. In the 1820s, as part of the Romantic revival, tartan and the kilt were adopted by members of the social elite, not just in Scotland, but across Europe,[90][91] prompted by the popularity of Macpherson's Ossian cycle[92][93] and then Walter Scott's Waverley novels.[94] The Highlands remained poor and the only part of mainland Britain with a recurrent famine. A small range of products were exported from the region, which had negligible industrial production and a continued population growth that tested the subsistence agriculture. These problems, and the desire to improve agriculture and profits were the driving forces of the ongoing Highland Clearances, in which many of the population of the Highlands suffered eviction as lands were enclosed, principally so that they could be used for sheep farming. The first phase of the clearances followed patterns of agricultural change throughout Britain. The second phase was driven by overpopulation, the Highland Potato Famine and the collapse of industries that had relied on the wartime economy of the Napoleonic Wars.[95] The population of Scotland grew steadily in the 19th century, from 1,608,000 in the census of 1801 to 2,889,000 in 1851 and 4,472,000 in 1901.[96] Even with the development of industry, there were not enough good jobs. As a result, during the period 1841\u20131931, about 2 million Scots migrated to North America and Australia, and another 750,000 Scots relocated to England.[97]\nAfter prolonged years of struggle in the Kirk, the Evangelicals gained control of the General Assembly in 1834 and passed the Veto Act, which allowed congregations to reject unwanted \"intrusive\" presentations to livings by patrons. The following \"Ten Years' Conflict\" of legal and political wrangling ended in defeat for the non-intrusionists in the civil courts. The result was a schism from the church by some of the non-intrusionists led by Dr Thomas Chalmers, known as the Great Disruption of 1843. Roughly a third of the clergy, mainly from the North and Highlands, formed the separate Free Church of Scotland.[98] In the late 19th century growing divisions between fundamentalist Calvinists and theological liberals resulted in a further split in the Free Church as the rigid Calvinists broke away to form the Free Presbyterian Church in 1893.[99] Catholic emancipation in 1829 and the influx of large numbers of Irish immigrants, particularly after the famine years of the late 1840s, mainly to the growing lowland centres like Glasgow, led to a transformation in the fortunes of Catholicism. In 1878, despite opposition, a Roman Catholic ecclesiastical hierarchy was restored to the country, and Catholicism became a significant denomination within Scotland.[99]\nIndustrialisation, urbanisation and the Disruption of 1843 all undermined the tradition of parish schools. From 1830 the state began to fund buildings with grants; then from 1846 it was funding schools by direct sponsorship; and in 1872 Scotland moved to a system like that in England of state-sponsored largely free schools, run by local school boards.[100] The historic University of Glasgow became a leader in British higher education by providing the educational needs of youth from the urban and commercial classes, as opposed to the upper class.[101] The University of St Andrews pioneered the admission of women to Scottish universities. From 1892 Scottish universities could admit and graduate women and the numbers of women at Scottish universities steadily increased until the early 20th century.[102]\nCaused by the advent of refrigeration and imports of lamb, mutton and wool from overseas, the 1870s brought with them a collapse of sheep prices and an abrupt halt in the previous sheep farming boom.[103] Land prices subsequently plummeted, too, and accelerated the process of the so-called \"Balmoralisation\" of Scotland, an era in the second half of the 19th century that saw an increase in tourism and the establishment of large estates dedicated to field sports like deer stalking and grouse shooting, especially in the Scottish Highlands.[103][104] The process was named after Balmoral estate, purchased by Queen Victoria in 1848, that fuelled the romanticisation of upland Scotland and initiated an influx of the newly wealthy acquiring similar estates in the following decades.[103][104] In the late 19th century just 118 people owned half of Scotland, with nearly 60 per cent of the whole country being part of shooting estates.[103] While their relative importance has somewhat declined due to changing recreational interests throughout the 20th century, deer stalking and grouse shooting remain of prime importance on many private estates in Scotland.[103][105]\nScotland played a major role in the British effort in the First World War. It especially provided manpower, ships, machinery, fish and money.[106] With a population of 4.8 million in 1911, Scotland sent over half a million men to the war, of whom over a quarter died in combat or from disease, and 150,000 were seriously wounded.[107] Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig was Britain's commander on the Western Front.\nThe war saw the emergence of a radical movement called \"Red Clydeside\" led by militant trades unionists. Formerly a Liberal stronghold, the industrial districts switched to Labour by 1922, with a base among the Irish Catholic working-class districts. Women were especially active in building neighbourhood solidarity on housing issues. The \"Reds\" operated within the Labour Party with little influence in Parliament and the mood changed to passive despair by the late 1920s.[108]\nThe shipbuilding industry expanded by a third and expected renewed prosperity, but instead, a serious depression hit the economy by 1922 and it did not fully recover until 1939. The interwar years were marked by economic stagnation in rural and urban areas, and high unemployment.[109] Indeed, the war brought with it deep social, cultural, economic, and political dislocations. Thoughtful Scots pondered their declension, as the main social indicators such as poor health, bad housing, and long-term mass unemployment, pointed to terminal social and economic stagnation at best, or even a downward spiral. Service abroad on behalf of the Empire lost its allure to ambitious young people, who left Scotland permanently. The heavy dependence on obsolescent heavy industry and mining was a central problem, and no one offered workable solutions. The despair reflected what Finlay (1994) describes as a widespread sense of hopelessness that prepared local business and political leaders to accept a new orthodoxy of centralised government economic planning when it arrived during the Second World War.[110]\nDuring the Second World War, Scotland was targeted by Nazi Germany largely due to its factories, shipyards, and coal mines.[111] Cities such as Glasgow and Edinburgh were targeted by German bombers, as were smaller towns mostly located in the central belt of the country.[111] Perhaps the most significant air-raid in Scotland was the Clydebank Blitz of March 1941, which intended to destroy naval shipbuilding in the area.[112] 528 people were killed and 4,000 homes totally destroyed.[112]\nPerhaps Scotland's most unusual wartime episode occurred in 1941 when Rudolf Hess flew to Renfrewshire, possibly intending to broker a peace deal through the Duke of Hamilton.[113] Before his departure from Germany, Hess had given his adjutant, Karlheinz Pintsch, a letter addressed to Hitler that detailed his intentions to open peace negotiations with the British. Pintsch delivered the letter to Hitler at the Berghof around noon on 11 May.[114] Albert Speer later said Hitler described Hess's departure as one of the worst personal blows of his life, as he considered it a personal betrayal.[115] Hitler worried that his allies, Italy and Japan, would perceive Hess's act as an attempt by Hitler to secretly open peace negotiations with the British.\nAs in World War I, Scapa Flow in Orkney served as an important Royal Navy base. Attacks on Scapa Flow and Rosyth gave RAF fighters their first successes downing bombers in the Firth of Forth and East Lothian.[116] The shipyards and heavy engineering factories in Glasgow and Clydeside played a key part in the war effort, and suffered attacks from the Luftwaffe, enduring great destruction and loss of life.[117] As transatlantic voyages involved negotiating north-west Britain, Scotland played a key part in the battle of the North Atlantic.[118] Shetland's relative proximity to occupied Norway resulted in the Shetland bus by which fishing boats helped Norwegians flee the Nazis, and expeditions across the North Sea to assist resistance.[119]\nScottish industry came out of the depression slump by a dramatic expansion of its industrial activity, absorbing unemployed men and many women as well. The shipyards were the centre of more activity, but many smaller industries produced the machinery needed by the British bombers, tanks and warships.[117] Agriculture prospered, as did all sectors except for coal mining, which was operating mines near exhaustion. Real wages, adjusted for inflation, rose 25% and unemployment temporarily vanished. Increased income, and the more equal distribution of food, obtained through a tight rationing system, dramatically improved the health and nutrition.\nAfter 1945, Scotland's economic situation worsened due to overseas competition, inefficient industry, and industrial disputes.[120] Only in recent decades has the country enjoyed something of a cultural and economic renaissance. Economic factors contributing to this recovery included a resurgent financial services industry, electronics manufacturing, (see Silicon Glen),[121] and the North Sea oil and gas industry.[122] The introduction in 1989 by Margaret Thatcher's government of the Community Charge (widely known as the Poll Tax) one year before the rest of Great Britain,[123] contributed to a growing movement for Scottish control over domestic affairs.[124] Following a referendum on devolution proposals in 1997, the Scotland Act 1998[125] was passed by the British Parliament, which established a devolved Scottish Parliament and Scottish Government with responsibility for most laws specific to Scotland.[126] The Scottish Parliament was reconvened in Edinburgh on 4 July 1999.[127] The first to hold the office of first minister of Scotland was Donald Dewar, who served until his sudden death in 2000.[128]\nThe Scottish Parliament Building at Holyrood opened in October 2004 after lengthy construction delays and running over budget.[129] The Scottish Parliament's form of proportional representation (the additional member system) resulted in no one party having an overall majority for the first three Scottish parliament elections. The pro-independence Scottish National Party led by Alex Salmond achieved an overall majority in the 2011 election, winning 69 of the 129 seats available.[130] The success of the SNP in achieving a majority in the Scottish Parliament paved the way for the September 2014 referendum on Scottish independence. The majority voted against the proposition, with 55% voting no to independence.[131] More powers, particularly in relation to taxation, were devolved to the Scottish Parliament after the referendum, following cross-party talks in the Smith Commission.\nThe mainland of Scotland comprises the northern third of the land mass of the island of Great Britain, which lies off the north-west coast of Continental Europe. The total area is 30,414 square miles (78,772\u00a0km2),[132] comparable to the size of the Czech Republic. Scotland's only land border is with England, and runs for 96 miles (154\u00a0km) between the basin of the River Tweed on the east coast and the Solway Firth in the west. The Atlantic Ocean borders the west coast and the North Sea is to the east. The island of Ireland lies only 13 miles (21\u00a0km) from the south-western peninsula of Kintyre;[133] Norway is 190 miles (305\u00a0km) to the east and the Faroe Islands, 168 miles (270\u00a0km) to the north.\nThe territorial extent of Scotland is generally that established by the 1237 Treaty of York between Scotland and the Kingdom of England[134] and the 1266 Treaty of Perth between Scotland and Norway.[24] Important exceptions include the Isle of Man, which having been lost to England in the 14th century is now a crown dependency outside of the United Kingdom; the island groups Orkney and Shetland, which were acquired from Norway in 1472;[132] and Berwick-upon-Tweed, lost to England in 1482\nThe geographical centre of Scotland lies a few miles from the village of Newtonmore in Badenoch.[135] Rising to 1,344 metres (4,409\u00a0ft) above sea level, Scotland's highest point is the summit of Ben Nevis, in Lochaber, while Scotland's longest river, the River Tay, flows for a distance of 118 miles (190\u00a0km).[136][137]\nThe whole of Scotland was covered by ice sheets during the Pleistocene ice ages and the landscape is much affected by glaciation. From a geological perspective, the country has three main sub-divisions.\nThe Highlands and Islands lie to the north and west of the Highland Boundary Fault, which runs from Arran to Stonehaven. This part of Scotland largely comprises ancient rocks from the Cambrian and Precambrian, which were uplifted during the later Caledonian orogeny. It is interspersed with igneous intrusions of a more recent age, remnants of which formed mountain massifs such as the Cairngorms and Skye Cuillins.[citation needed] In north-eastern mainland Scotland weathering of rock that occurred before the Last Ice Age has shaped much of the landscape.[138]\nA significant exception to the above are the fossil-bearing beds of Old Red Sandstones found principally along the Moray Firth coast. The Highlands are generally mountainous and the highest elevations in the British Isles are found here. Scotland has over 790 islands divided into four main groups: Shetland, Orkney, and the Inner Hebrides and Outer Hebrides. There are numerous bodies of freshwater including Loch Lomond and Loch Ness. Some parts of the coastline consist of machair, a low-lying dune pasture land.\nThe Central Lowlands is a rift valley mainly comprising Paleozoic formations. Many of these sediments have economic significance for it is here that the coal and iron bearing rocks that fuelled Scotland's industrial revolution are found. This area has also experienced intense volcanism, Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh being the remnant of a once much larger volcano. This area is relatively low-lying, although even here hills such as the Ochils and Campsie Fells are rarely far from view.\nThe Southern Uplands are a range of hills almost 125 miles (200\u00a0km) long, interspersed with broad valleys. They lie south of a second fault line (the Southern Uplands fault) that runs from Girvan to Dunbar.[139][140][141] The geological foundations largely comprise Silurian deposits laid down some 400 to 500\u00a0million years ago. The high point of the Southern Uplands is Merrick with an elevation of 843\u00a0m (2,766\u00a0ft).[23][142][143][144] The Southern Uplands is home to Scotland's highest village, Wanlockhead (430\u00a0m or 1,411\u00a0ft above sea level).[141]\nThe climate of most of Scotland is temperate and oceanic, and tends to be very changeable. As it is warmed by the Gulf Stream from the Atlantic, it has much milder winters (but cooler, wetter summers) than areas on similar latitudes, such as Labrador, southern Scandinavia, the Moscow region in Russia, and the Kamchatka Peninsula on the opposite side of Eurasia. Temperatures are generally lower than in the rest of the UK, with the temperature of \u221227.2\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221217.0\u00a0\u00b0F) recorded at Braemar in the Grampian Mountains, on 11 February 1895, the coldest ever recorded anywhere in the UK.[145] Winter maxima average 6\u00a0\u00b0C (43\u00a0\u00b0F) in the Lowlands, with summer maxima averaging 18\u00a0\u00b0C (64\u00a0\u00b0F). The highest temperature recorded was 35.1\u00a0\u00b0C (95.2\u00a0\u00b0F) at Floors Castle, Scottish Borders on 19 July 2022.[146]\nThe west of Scotland is usually warmer than the east, owing to the influence of Atlantic ocean currents and the colder surface temperatures of the North Sea. Tiree, in the Inner Hebrides, is one of the sunniest places in the country: it had more than 300 hours of sunshine in May 1975.[147] Rainfall varies widely across Scotland. The western highlands of Scotland are the wettest, with annual rainfall in a few places exceeding 3,000\u00a0mm (120\u00a0in).[148] In comparison, much of lowland Scotland receives less than 800\u00a0mm (31\u00a0in) annually.[149] Heavy snowfall is not common in the lowlands, but becomes more common with altitude. Braemar has an average of 59 snow days per year,[150] while many coastal areas average fewer than 10 days of lying snow per year.[149]\nScotland's wildlife is typical of the north-west of Europe, although several of the larger mammals such as the lynx, brown bear, wolf, elk and walrus were hunted to extinction in historic times. There are important populations of seals and internationally significant nesting grounds for a variety of seabirds such as gannets.[151] The golden eagle is something of a national icon.[152]\nOn the high mountain tops, species including ptarmigan, mountain hare and stoat can be seen in their white colour phase during winter months.[153] Remnants of the native Scots pine forest exist[154] and within these areas the Scottish crossbill, the UK's only endemic bird species and vertebrate, can be found alongside capercaillie, Scottish wildcat, red squirrel and pine marten.[155][156][157] Various animals have been re-introduced, including the white-tailed eagle in 1975, the red kite in the 1980s,[158][159] and there have been experimental projects involving the beaver and wild boar. Today, much of the remaining native Caledonian Forest lies within the Cairngorms National Park and remnants of the forest remain at 84 locations across Scotland. On the west coast, remnants of ancient Celtic Rainforest still remain, particularly on the Taynish peninsula in Argyll, these forests are particularly rare due to high rates of deforestation throughout Scottish history.[160][161]\nThe flora of the country is varied incorporating both deciduous and coniferous woodland as well as moorland and tundra species. Large-scale commercial tree planting and management of upland moorland habitat for the grazing of sheep and field sport activities like deer stalking and driven grouse shooting impacts the distribution of indigenous plants and animals.[162] The UK's tallest tree is a grand fir planted beside Loch Fyne, Argyll in the 1870s, and the Fortingall Yew may be 5,000 years old and is probably the oldest living thing in Europe.[dubious  \u2013 discuss][163][164][165] Although the number of native vascular plants is low by world standards, Scotland's substantial bryophyte flora is of global importance.[166][167]\nThe population of Scotland at the 2001 Census was 5,062,011. This rose to 5,295,400, the highest ever, at the 2011 Census.[168] The most recent ONS estimate, for mid-2019, was 5,463,300.[12]\nIn the 2011 Census, 62% of Scotland's population stated their national identity as 'Scottish only', 18% as 'Scottish and British', 8% as 'British only', and 4% chose 'other identity only'.[169]\nIn August 2012, the Scottish population reached an all-time high of 5.25\u00a0million people.[170] The reasons given were that, in Scotland, births were outnumbering the number of deaths, and immigrants were moving to Scotland from overseas. In 2011, 43,700 people moved from Wales, Northern Ireland or England to live in Scotland.[170]\nMid-2020 Scottish Government estimates the population of Scotland to stand at 5,470,824 inhabitants.[171] The most recent census in Scotland was conducted by the Scottish Government and the National Records of Scotland in March 2022.[172]\nOver the course of its history, Scotland has long had a tradition of migration from Scotland and immigration into Scotland. In 2021, the Scottish Government released figures showing that an estimated 41,000 people had immigrated from other international countries into Scotland, whilst an average of 22,100 people had migrated from Scotland.[173] Scottish Government data from 2002 shows that by 2021, there had been a sharp increase in immigration to Scotland, with 2002 estimates standing at 27,800 immigrants. While immigration had increased from 2002, migration from Scotland had dropped, with 2002 estimates standing at 26,200 people migrating from Scotland.[174]\nAlthough Edinburgh is the capital of Scotland, the largest city is Glasgow, which has just over 584,000 inhabitants. The Greater Glasgow conurbation, with a population of almost 1.2\u00a0million, is home to nearly a quarter of Scotland's population.[175] The Central Belt is where most of the main towns and cities are located, including Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, and Perth. Scotland's only major city outside the Central Belt is Aberdeen. The Scottish Lowlands host 80% of the total population, where the Central Belt accounts for 3.5\u00a0million people.\nIn general, only the more accessible and larger islands remain inhabited. Currently, fewer than 90 remain inhabited. The Southern Uplands are essentially rural in nature and dominated by agriculture and forestry.[176][177] Because of housing problems in Glasgow and Edinburgh, five new towns were designated between 1947 and 1966. They are East Kilbride, Glenrothes, Cumbernauld, Livingston, and Irvine.[178]\nScotland has three officially recognised languages: English, Scots, and Scottish Gaelic.[180][181] Scottish Standard English, a variety of English as spoken in Scotland, is at one end of a bipolar linguistic continuum, with broad Scots at the other.[182] Scottish Standard English may have been influenced to varying degrees by Scots.[183][184] The 2011 census indicated that 63% of the population had \"no skills in Scots\".[185] Others speak Highland English. Gaelic is mostly spoken in the Western Isles, where a large proportion of people still speak it. Nationally, its use is confined to 1% of the population.[186] The number of Gaelic speakers in Scotland dropped from 250,000 in 1881 to 60,000 in 2008.[187]\nImmigration since World War II has given Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Dundee small South Asian communities.[188] In 2011, there were an estimated 49,000 ethnically Pakistani people living in Scotland, making them the largest non-White ethnic group.[189] Since the enlargement of the European Union more people from Central and Eastern Europe have moved to Scotland, and the 2011 census indicated that 61,000 Poles live there.[189][190]\nThere are many more people with Scottish ancestry living abroad than the total population of Scotland. In the 2000 Census, 9.2\u00a0million Americans self-reported some degree of Scottish descent.[191] Ulster's Protestant population is mainly of lowland Scottish descent,[192] and it is estimated that there are more than 27\u00a0million descendants of the Scots-Irish migration now living in the US.[193][194] In Canada, the Scottish-Canadian community accounts for 4.7\u00a0million people.[195] About 20% of the original European settler population of New Zealand came from Scotland.[196]\nThe total fertility rate (TFR) in Scotland is below the replacement rate of 2.1 (the TFR was 1.73 in 2011[197]). The majority of births are to unmarried women (51.3% of births were outside of marriage in 2012[198]).\nLife expectancy for those born in Scotland between 2012 and 2014 is 77.1 years for males and 81.1 years for females.[199] This is the lowest of any of the four countries of the UK.[199] The number of hospital admissions in Scotland for diseases such as cancer was 2,528 in 2002. Over the next ten years, by 2012, this had increased to 2,669.[200] Hospital admissions for other diseases, such as coronary heart disease (CHD) were lower, with 727 admissions in 2002, and decreasing to 489 in 2012.[201]\nData collated by the Scottish Government in 2018/2019 asked the general population of Scotland to self assess their general health to provide a large sample for subnational analysis. The data collated highlighted that 72% of people in Scotland ranked their general health as \"good or very good\", 19.8% as \"fair\" and 8.1% of people saying that their general health is \"bad or very bad\".[202]\nForms of Christianity have dominated religious life in what is now the Scotland for more than 1,400 years.[203][204]\nIn 2011 just over half (54%) of the Scottish population reported being a Christian while nearly 37% reported not having a religion in a 2011 census.[205]\nSince the Scottish Reformation of 1560, the national church (the Church of Scotland, also known as The Kirk) has been Protestant in classification and Reformed in theology. Since 1689 it has had a Presbyterian system of church government and enjoys independence from the state.[23] Its membership dropped just below 300,000 in 2020 (5% of the total population) [206][207][208] The Church operates a territorial parish structure, with every community in Scotland having a local congregation.\nScotland also has a significant Roman Catholic population, 19% professing that faith, particularly in Greater Glasgow and the north-west.[209] After the Reformation, Roman Catholicism in Scotland continued in the Highlands and some western islands like Uist and Barra, and it was strengthened during the 19th century by immigration from Ireland. Other Christian denominations in Scotland include the Free Church of Scotland, and various other Presbyterian offshoots. Scotland's third largest church is the Scottish Episcopal Church.[210]\nThere are an estimated 75,000 Muslims in Scotland (about 1.4% of the population),[205][211] and significant but smaller Jewish, Hindu and Sikh communities, especially in Glasgow.[211] The Samy\u00e9 Ling monastery near Eskdalemuir, which celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2007, is the first Buddhist monastery in western Europe.[212]\nEducation in Scotland is the responsibility of the Scottish Government and is overseen by its executive agency Education Scotland.[213] The Scottish education system has always been distinct from the rest of the United Kingdom, with a characteristic emphasis on a broad education.[214] In the 15th century, the Humanist emphasis on education cumulated with the passing of the Education Act 1496, which decreed that all sons of barons and freeholders of substance should attend grammar schools to learn \"perfyct Latyne\", resulting in an increase in literacy among a male and wealthy elite.[215] In the Reformation, the 1560 First Book of Discipline set out a plan for a school in every parish, but this proved financially impossible.[216] In 1616 an act in Privy council commanded every parish to establish a school.[217] By the late seventeenth century there was a largely complete network of parish schools in the lowlands, but in the Highlands basic education was still lacking in many areas.[218] Education remained a matter for the church rather than the state until the Education (Scotland) Act 1872.[219]\nThe Curriculum for Excellence, Scotland's national school curriculum, presently provides the curricular framework for children and young people from age 3 to 18.[220] All 3- and 4-year-old children in Scotland are entitled to a free nursery place. Formal primary education begins at approximately 5 years old and lasts for 7 years (P1\u2013P7); children in Scotland study National Qualifications of the Curriculum for Excellence between the ages of 14 and 18. The school leaving age is 16, after which students may choose to remain at school and study further qualifications. A small number of students at certain private schools may follow the English system and study towards GCSEs and A and AS-Levels instead.[221]\nThere are fifteen Scottish universities, some of which are amongst the oldest in the world.[222][223] The four universities founded before the end of the 16th century \u2013 the University of St Andrews, the University of Glasgow, the University of Aberdeen and the University of Edinburgh \u2013 are collectively known as the ancient universities of Scotland, all of which rank among the 200 best universities in the world in the THE rankings, with Edinburgh placing in the top 50.[224] Scotland had more universities per capita in QS' World University Rankings' top 100 in 2012 than any other nation.[225] The country produces 1% of the world's published research with less than 0.1% of the world's population, and higher education institutions account for 9% of Scotland's service sector exports.[226][227] Scotland's University Courts are the only bodies in Scotland authorised to award degrees.\nTuition fees are handled by the Student Awards Agency Scotland (SAAS), which pays the fees of what it defines as \"Young Students\". Young Students are defined as those under 25, without children, marriage, civil partnership or cohabiting partner, who have not been outside of full-time education for more than three years. Fees must be paid by those outside the young student definition, typically from \u00a31,200 to \u00a31,800 for undergraduate courses, dependent on year of application and type of qualification. Postgraduate fees can be up to \u00a33,400.[228] The system has been in place since 2007 when graduate endowments were abolished.[229] Labour's education spokesperson Rhona Brankin criticised the Scottish system for failing to address student poverty.[230]\nScotland's universities are complemented in the provision of Further and Higher Education by 43 colleges. Colleges offer National Certificates, Higher National Certificates, and Higher National Diplomas. These Group Awards, alongside Scottish Vocational Qualifications, aim to ensure Scotland's population has the appropriate skills and knowledge to meet workplace needs. In 2014, research reported by the Office for National Statistics found that Scotland was the most highly educated country in Europe and among the most well-educated in the world in terms of tertiary education attainment, with roughly 40% of people in Scotland aged 16\u201364 educated to NVQ level 4 and above.[231] Based on the original data for EU statistical regions, all four Scottish regions ranked significantly above the European average for completion of tertiary-level education by 25- to 64-year-olds.[232]\nKilmarnock Academy in East Ayrshire is one of only two schools in the UK, and the only school in Scotland, to have educated two Nobel Prize Laureates \u2013 Alexander Fleming, discoverer of Penicillin, and John Boyd Orr, 1st Baron Boyd-Orr, for his scientific research into nutrition and his work as the first Director-General of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).\nHealth care in Scotland is mainly provided by NHS Scotland, Scotland's public health care system. This was founded by the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1947 (later repealed by the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978) that took effect on 5 July 1948 to coincide with the launch of the NHS in England and Wales. Prior to 1948, half of Scotland's landmass was already covered by state-funded health care, provided by the Highlands and Islands Medical Service.[234] Healthcare policy and funding is the responsibility of the Scottish Government's Health Directorates.\nIn 2014, the NHS in Scotland had around 140,000 staff.[235]\nThe head of state of the United Kingdom is the monarch, who is King Charles III.[236] The monarchy of the United Kingdom continues to use a variety of styles, titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to pre-union Scotland, including: the Royal Standard of Scotland, the Royal coat of arms used in Scotland together with its associated Royal Standard, royal titles including that of Duke of Rothesay, certain Great Officers of State, the chivalric Order of the Thistle and, since 1999, reinstating a ceremonial role for the Crown of Scotland after a 292-year hiatus.[237] Queen Elizabeth II's regnal numbering caused controversy in 1953 because there had never been an Elizabeth I in Scotland. MacCormick v Lord Advocate was a legal action was brought in Scotland's Court of Session by the Scottish Covenant Association to contest the right of the Queen to entitle herself \"Elizabeth II\" within Scotland, but the Crown won the appeal against the case's dismissal, as royal titulature was legislated for by the Royal Titles Act 1953 and a matter of royal prerogative.[238]\nScotland has limited self-government within the United Kingdom, as well as representation in the British Parliament. Executive and legislative powers respectively have been devolved to the Scottish Government and the Scottish Parliament at Holyrood in Edinburgh since 1999. The British Parliament retains control over reserved matters specified in the Scotland Act 1998, including taxes, social security, defence, international relations and broadcasting.[239] The Scottish Parliament has legislative authority for all other areas relating to Scotland. It initially had only a limited power to vary income tax,[240] but powers over taxation and social security were significantly expanded by the Scotland Acts of 2012 and 2016.[241] The 2016 Act gave the Scottish Government powers to manage the affairs of the Crown Estate in Scotland, leading to the creation of Crown Estate Scotland.[242]\nThe Scottish Parliament can give legislative consent over devolved matters back to the British Parliament by passing a Legislative Consent Motion if United Kingdom-wide legislation is considered more appropriate for a certain issue. The programmes of legislation enacted by the Scottish Parliament have seen a divergence in the provision of public services compared to the rest of the UK. For instance, university education and some care services for the elderly are free at point of use in Scotland, while fees are paid in the rest of the UK. Scotland was the first country in the UK to ban smoking in enclosed public places.[243]\nThe Scottish Parliament is a unicameral legislature with 129 members (MSPs): 73 of them represent individual constituencies and are elected on a first-past-the-post system; the other 56 are elected in eight different electoral regions by the additional member system. MSPs normally serve for a five-year period.[244] The Parliament nominates one of its Members, who is then appointed by the monarch to serve as first minister. Other ministers are appointed by the first minister and serve at his/her discretion. Together they make up the Scottish Government, the executive arm of the devolved government.[245] The Scottish Government is headed by the first minister, who is accountable to the Scottish Parliament and is the minister of charge of the Scottish Government. The first minister is also the political leader of Scotland. The Scottish Government also comprises the deputy first minister, who deputises for the first minister during a period of absence. Alongside the deputy first minister's requirements as Deputy, the minister also has a cabinet ministerial responsibility.[246] The current Scottish Government has nine cabinet secretaries and there are 15 other ministers who work alongside the cabinet secretaries in their appointed areas.[247]\nIn the 2021 election, the Scottish National Party (SNP) won 64 of the 129 seats available.[248] Humza Yousaf, the leader of the SNP, has been the first minister since March 2023. The Scottish Conservatives, Scottish Labour, the Scottish Liberal Democrats and the Scottish Greens also have representation in the Parliament.[248] The next Scottish Parliament election is due to be held on 7 May 2026.[249]\nScotland is represented in the British House of Commons by 59 MPs elected from territory-based Scottish constituencies. In the 2019 general election, the SNP won 48 of the 59 seats.[250] This represented a significant increase from the 2017 general election, when the SNP won 35 seats.[250][251] Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat parties also represent Scottish constituencies in the House of Commons.[250] The next general election is scheduled for 2 May 2024. The Scotland Office represents the British government in Scotland on reserved matters and represents Scottish interests within the government.[252] The Scotland Office is led by the Secretary of State for Scotland, who sits in the Cabinet of the United Kingdom.[253] Conservative MP Alister Jack has held the position since July 2019.[253]\nSince 1999, relations between the devolved governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland with the Government of the United Kingdom has been conducted under the banner of Intergovernmental Relations. The First Minister, other cabinet secrateries   and junior ministers of the Scottish Government are in daily communication relating to areas of national and international interest, discussing joint policy making and strengthening approaches to working together.[254] A Memorandum of Understanding, created in 1999, lays emphasis on the principles of good communication, consultation and co-operation.[255] Overall, accountability for intergovernmental relations is the responsibility of the First Minister.[254] The First Minister is a member of the Heads of Government Council (\"The Council\") (previously the Joint Ministerial Committee). Other cabinet secreraties and junior ministers within the Scottish Government participate in tier two (the Inter-ministerial Standing Committee) and tier 3 (the Inter-ministerial Group) of The Council which may include areas including education, finance and economy, investment and trade and rural affairs.[254]\nSince devolution in 1999, Scotland has devolved stronger working relations across the two other devolved governments, the Welsh Government and Northern Ireland Executive. Whilst there are no formal concordats between the Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland Executive, ministers from each devolved government meet at various points throughout the year at various events such as the British-Irish Council and also meet to discuss matters and issues that are devolved to each government.[256] The Scottish Government considers the successful re-establishment of the Plenary, and establishment of the Domestic fora to be important facets of the relationship with the British Government and the other devolved administrations.[256]\nIn the aftermath of the United Kingdom's decision to withdraw from the European Union in 2016, the Scottish Government has called for there to be a joint approach from each of the devolved governments. In early 2017, the devolved governments met to discuss Brexit and agree on Brexit strategies from each devolved government[257] which lead for Theresa May to issue a statement that stated that the devolved governments will not have a central role or decision-making process in the Brexit process, but that the central government plans to \"fully engage\" Scotland in talks alongside the governments of Wales and Northern Ireland.[258]\nWhilst foreign policy remains a reserved matter,[259] the Scottish Government may promote the economy and Scottish interests on the world stage and encourage foreign businesses, international devolved, regional and central governments to invest in Scotland.[260] Whilst the first minister usually undertakes a number of international visits to promote Scotland, international relations, European and Commonwealth relations are also included within the portfolios of both the Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs (responsible for international development)[261] and the Minister for International Development and Europe (responsible for European Union relations and international relations).[262]\nWhilst an independent sovereign nation, Scotland had a close \"special relationship\" with France (known then as the Kingdom of France). In 1295, both Scotland and France signed what became known as the Auld Alliance in Paris, which acted as a military and diplomatic alliance between English invasion and expansion.[263] The French military sought the assistance of Scotland in 1415 during the Battle of Agincourt which was close to bringing the Kingdom of France to collapse.[263] The Auld Alliance was seen as important for Scotland and its position within Europe, having signed a treaty of military, economic and diplomatic co-operation with a wealthy European nation.[264] There had been an agreement between Scotland and France that allowed citizens of both countries to hold dual citizenship, which was revoked by the French Government in 1903.[265] In recent times, there have been arguments that indicate that the Auld Alliance was never formally ended by either Scotland or France, and that many elements of the treaty may remain in place today.[266] Scotland and France still have a special relationship, with a Statement of Intent being signed in 2013 which committed both Scotland and France to building on shared history, friendship, co-operation between governments and cultural exchange programmes.[267]\nDuring the 31st G8 summit in 2005, the first minister of Scotland Jack McConnell welcomed each head of government of the G8 nations to the country's Glasgow Prestwick Airport[268] on behalf of prime minister Tony Blair. At the same time, McConnell and the then Scottish Executive pioneered the way forward to launch what would become the Scotland Malawi Partnership which co-ordinates Scottish activities to strengthen existing links with Malawi.[269] During McConnell's time as first minister, several relations with Scotland, including Scottish and Russian relations strengthened following a visit by President of Russia Vladimir Putin to Edinburgh. McConnell, speaking at the end, highlighted that the visit by Putin was a \"post-devolution\" step towards \"Scotland regaining its international identity\".[270]\nUnder the Salmond administration, Scotland's trade and investment deals with countries such as China[271][272] and Canada, where Salmond established the Canada Plan 2010\u20132015 which aimed to strengthen \"the important historical, cultural and economic links\" between both Canada and Scotland.[273] To promote Scotland's interests and Scottish businesses in North America, there is a Scottish Affairs Office located in Washington, D.C. with the aim to promoting Scotland in both the United States and Canada.[274]\nDuring a 2017 visit to the United States, the first minister Nicola Sturgeon met Jerry Brown, Governor of California, where both signed an agreement committing both the Government of California and the Scottish Government to work together to tackle climate change,[275] as well as Sturgeon signing a \u00a36.3\u00a0million deal for Scottish investment from American businesses and firms promoting trade, tourism and innovation.[276] During an official visit to the Republic of Ireland in 2016, Sturgeon stated that is it \"important for Ireland and Scotland and the whole of the British Isles that Ireland has a strong ally in Scotland\".[277] During the same engagement, Sturgeon became the first head of government to address the Seanad \u00c9ireann, the upper house of the Oireachtas (the Irish parliament).[277]\nScotland has a network of eight international offices across the world, these are located in:\nA policy of devolution had been advocated by the three main British political parties with varying enthusiasm during recent history. A previous Labour leader, John Smith, described the revival of a Scottish parliament as the \"settled will of the Scottish people\".[281] The devolved Scottish Parliament was created after a referendum in 1997 found majority support for both creating the Parliament and granting it limited powers to vary income tax.[282]\nThe Scottish National Party (SNP), which supports Scottish independence, was first elected to form the Scottish Government in 2007. The new government established a \"National Conversation\" on constitutional issues, proposing a number of options such as increasing the powers of the Scottish Parliament, federalism, or a referendum on Scottish independence from the United Kingdom. In rejecting the last option, the three main opposition parties in the Scottish Parliament created a commission to investigate the distribution of powers between devolved Scottish and UK-wide bodies.[283] The Scotland Act 2012, based on proposals by the commission, was subsequently enacted devolving additional powers to the Scottish Parliament.[284]\nIn August 2009 the SNP proposed a bill to hold a referendum on independence in November 2010. Opposition from all other major parties led to an expected defeat.[285][286][287] After the 2011 Scottish Parliament election gave the SNP an overall majority in the Scottish Parliament, the 2014 Scottish independence referendum was held on 18 September.[288] The referendum resulted in a rejection of independence, by 55.3% to 44.7%.[289][290] During the campaign, the three main parties in the British Parliament pledged to extend the powers of the Scottish Parliament.[291][292] An all-party commission chaired by Robert Smith, Baron Smith of Kelvin was formed,[292] which led to a further devolution of powers through the Scotland Act 2016.[293]\nFollowing the European Union Referendum Act 2015, the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum was held on 23 June 2016 on Britain's membership of the European Union. A majority in the United Kingdom voted to withdraw from the EU, whilst a majority within Scotland voted to remain a member.[294]\nThe first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, announced the following day that as a result a new independence referendum was \"highly likely\".[295][294] On 31 January 2020, the United Kingdom formally withdrew from the European Union. At Holyrood, Sturgeon's governing SNP continues to campaign for such a referendum; in December 2019 a formal request for the powers to hold one under Section 30 of the Scotland Act was submitted.[296][297][298] In June 2022, Sturgeon announced plans to hold a referendum on 19 October 2023.[299] At Westminster, the governing second Johnson ministry of the Conservative Party is opposed to another referendum and has refused the first minister's request.[300][301][302] Because constitutional affairs are reserved matters under the Scotland Act, the Scottish Parliament would again have to be granted temporary additional powers under Section 30 in order to hold a legally binding vote.[301][303][304]\nScotland has historical and cultural ties with northern countries outside the British Isles, such as the countries of Scandinavia.[305][306] Scottish Government policy advocates for stronger political relations with the Nordic and Baltic countries, which has resulted in some Nordic-inspired policies being adopted such as baby boxes.[307][308]\nHistorical subdivisions of Scotland included the mormaerdom, stewartry, earldom, burgh, parish, county and regions and districts. Some of these names are still sometimes used as geographical descriptors.[309]\nModern Scotland is subdivided in various ways depending on the purpose. In local government, there have been 32 single-tier council areas since 1996,[310] whose councils are responsible for the provision of all local government services. Decisions are made by councillors who are elected at local elections every five years. The head of each council is usually the Lord Provost alongside the Leader of the council,[311] with a Chief Executive being appointed as director of the council area.[312] Community Councils are informal organisations that represent specific sub-divisions within each council area.[309]\nIn the Scottish Parliament, there are 73 constituencies and eight regions. For the Parliament of the United Kingdom, there are 59 constituencies. Until 2013, the Scottish fire brigades and police forces were based on a system of regions introduced in 1975. For healthcare and postal districts, and a number of other governmental and non-governmental organisations such as the churches, there are other long-standing methods of subdividing Scotland for the purposes of administration.\nCity status in the United Kingdom is conferred by letters patent.[313] There are eight cities in Scotland: Aberdeen, Dundee, Dunfermline, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness, Stirling and Perth.[314]\nOf the money spent on UK defence, about \u00a33.3\u00a0billion can be attributed to Scotland as of 2018/2019.[315]\nScotland had a long military tradition predating the Treaty of Union with England; the Scots Army and Royal Scots Navy were (with the exception of the Atholl Highlanders, Europe's only legal private army) merged with their English counterparts to form the Royal Navy and the British Army, which together form part of the British Armed Forces. Numerous Scottish regiments have at various times existed in the British Army. Distinctively Scottish regiments in the British Army include the Scots Guards, the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards and the 154 (Scottish) Regiment RLC, an Army Reserve regiment of the Royal Logistic Corps. In 2006, as a result of the Delivering Security in a Changing World white paper, the Scottish infantry regiments in the Scottish Division were amalgamated to form the Royal Regiment of Scotland. As a result of the Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition's Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010, the Scottish regiments of the line in the British Army infantry, having previously formed the Scottish Division, were reorganised into the Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division in 2017. Before the formation of the Scottish Division, the Scottish infantry was organised into a Lowland Brigade and Highland Brigade.\nBecause of their topography and perceived remoteness, parts of Scotland have housed many sensitive defence establishments.[316][317][318] Between 1960 and 1991, the Holy Loch was a base for the US fleet of Polaris ballistic missile submarines.[319] Today, Her Majesty's Naval Base Clyde, 25 miles (40 kilometres) north-west of Glasgow, is the base for the four Trident-armed Vanguard-class ballistic missile submarines that comprise the Britain's nuclear deterrent. Scapa Flow was the major Fleet base for the Royal Navy until 1956.\nScotland's Scapa Flow was the main base for the Royal Navy in the 20th century.[320] As the Cold War intensified in 1961, the United States deployed Polaris ballistic missiles, and submarines, in the Firth of Clyde's Holy Loch. Public protests from CND campaigners proved futile. The Royal Navy successfully convinced the government to allow the base because it wanted its own Polaris submarines, and it obtained them in 1963. The RN's nuclear submarine base opened with four Resolution-class Polaris submarines at the expanded Faslane Naval Base on the Gare Loch. The first patrol of a Trident-armed submarine occurred in 1994, although the US base was closed at the end of the Cold War.[321]\nA single front-line Royal Air Force base is located in Scotland. RAF Lossiemouth, located in Moray, is the most northerly air defence fighter base in the United Kingdom and is home to three fast-jet squadrons equipped with the Eurofighter Typhoon.\nScots law has a basis derived from Roman law,[322] combining features of both uncodified civil law, dating back to the Corpus Juris Civilis, and common law with medieval sources. The terms of the Treaty of Union with England in 1707 guaranteed the continued existence of a separate legal system in Scotland from that of England and Wales.[323] Prior to 1611, there were several regional law systems in Scotland, most notably Udal law in Orkney and Shetland, based on old Norse law. Various other systems derived from common Celtic or Brehon laws survived in the Highlands until the 1800s.[324]\nScots law provides for three types of courts responsible for the administration of justice: civil, criminal and heraldic. The supreme civil court is the Court of Session, although civil appeals can be taken to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom (or before 1 October 2009, the House of Lords). The High Court of Justiciary is the supreme criminal court in Scotland. The Court of Session is housed at Parliament House, in Edinburgh, which was the home of the pre-Union Parliament of Scotland with the High Court of Justiciary and the Supreme Court of Appeal currently located at the Lawnmarket. The sheriff court is the main criminal and civil court, hearing most cases. There are 49 sheriff courts throughout the country.[325] District courts were introduced in 1975 for minor offences and small claims. These were gradually replaced by Justice of the Peace Courts from 2008 to 2010. The Court of the Lord Lyon regulates heraldry.\nFor three centuries the Scots legal system was unique for being the only national legal system without a parliament. This ended with the advent of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, which legislates for Scotland. Many features within the system have been preserved. Within criminal law, the Scots legal system is unique in having three possible verdicts: \"guilty\", \"not guilty\" and \"not proven\".[326] Both \"not guilty\" and \"not proven\" result in an acquittal, typically with no possibility of retrial in accordance with the rule of double jeopardy. A retrial can hear new evidence at a later date that might have proven conclusive in the earlier trial at first instance, where the person acquitted subsequently admits the offence or where it can be proved that the acquittal was tainted by an attempt to pervert the course of justice \u2013 see the provisions of the Double Jeopardy (Scotland) Act 2011. Many laws differ between Scotland and the other parts of the United Kingdom, and many terms differ for certain legal concepts. Manslaughter, in England and Wales, is broadly similar to culpable homicide in Scotland, and arson is called wilful fire raising. Indeed, some acts considered crimes in England and Wales, such as forgery, are not so in Scotland. Procedure also differs. Scots juries, sitting in criminal cases, consist of fifteen jurors, which is three more than is typical in many countries.[327]\nThe Lord Advocate is the chief legal officer of the Scottish Government and the Crown in Scotland. The Lord Advocate is the head of the systems in Scotland for the investigation and prosecution of crime, the investigation of deaths as well as serving as the principal legal adviser to the Scottish Government and representing the government in legal proceedings.[328] They are the chief public prosecutor for Scotland and all prosecutions on indictment are conducted by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service in the Lord Advocate's name on behalf of the Monarch.[328]\nThe officeholder is one of the Great Officers of State of Scotland. The current Lord Advocate is Dorothy Bain, who was nominated by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and appointed in June 2021.[329] The Lord Advocate is supported by the Solicitor General for Scotland, currently Ruth Charteris. The Solicitor General supports the Lord Advocate in the deployment of the Lord Advocate's functions, and may exercise their statutory and common law powers if deemed necessary.[330]\nThe Scottish Prison Service (SPS) manages the prisons in Scotland, which collectively house over 8,500 prisoners.[331] The Cabinet Secretary for Justice is responsible for the Scottish Prison Service within the Scottish Government.\nScotland has a Western-style open mixed economy closely linked with the rest of the UK and the wider world. Traditionally, the Scottish economy was dominated by heavy industry underpinned by shipbuilding in Glasgow, coal mining and steel industries. Petroleum related industries associated with the extraction of North Sea oil have also been important employers from the 1970s, especially in the north-east of Scotland. De-industrialisation during the 1970s and 1980s saw a shift from a manufacturing focus towards a more service-oriented economy.\nScotland's gross domestic product (GDP), including oil and gas produced in Scottish waters, was estimated at \u00a3150\u00a0billion for the calendar year 2012.[333] In 2014, Scotland's per capita GDP was one of the highest in the EU.[334] As of April 2019 the Scottish unemployment rate was 3.3%, below the UK's overall rate of 3.8%, and the Scottish employment rate was 75.9%.[335]\nEdinburgh is the financial services centre of Scotland, with many large finance firms based there, including: Lloyds Banking Group (owners of HBOS); the Government-owned Royal Bank of Scotland and Standard Life. Edinburgh was ranked 15th in the list of world financial centres in 2007, but fell to 37th in 2012, following damage to its reputation,[336] and in 2016 was ranked 56th out of 86.[337] Its status had returned to 17th by 2020.[338]\nIn 2014, total Scottish exports (excluding intra-UK trade) were estimated to be \u00a327.5\u00a0billion.[339] Scotland's primary exports include whisky, electronics and financial services.[340] The United States, Netherlands, Germany, France, and Norway constitute the country's major export markets.[340]\nWhisky is one of Scotland's more known goods of economic activity. Exports increased by 87% in the decade to 2012[341] and were valued at \u00a34.3\u00a0billion in 2013, which was 85% of Scotland's food and drink exports.[342] It supports around 10,000 jobs directly and 25,000 indirectly.[343] It may contribute \u00a3400\u2013682\u00a0million to Scotland, rather than several billion pounds, as more than 80% of whisky produced is owned by non-Scottish companies.[344] A briefing published in 2002 by the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe) for the Scottish Parliament's Enterprise and Life Long Learning Committee stated that tourism accounted for up to 5% of GDP and 7.5% of employment.[345]\nScotland was one of the industrial powerhouses of Europe from the time of the Industrial Revolution onwards, being a world leader in manufacturing.[346] This left a legacy in the diversity of goods and services which Scotland produces, from textiles, whisky and shortbread to jet engines, buses, computer software, ships, avionics and microelectronics, as well as banking, insurance, investment management and other related financial services.[347] In common with most other advanced industrialised economies, Scotland has seen a decline in the importance of both manufacturing industries and primary-based extractive industries. This has been combined with a rise in the service sector of the economy, which has grown to be the largest sector in Scotland.[348]\nThe average weekly income for workplace based employees in Scotland is \u00a3573GBP,[349] and \u00a3576GBP for residence based employees.[350] Scotland has the third highest median gross salary between the Countries of the United Kingdom and regions at \u00a326,007 and is higher than the overall UK average annual salary of \u00a325,971.[351] With an average of \u00a314.28, Scotland has the third highest median hourly rate (excluding overtime working hours) of any of the countries of the United Kingdom, and like the annual salary, is higher than the average UK figure as a whole.[352] The highest paid industries in Scotland tend of be in the utility electricity, gas and air conditioning sectors, with average hourly rates of \u00a321GBP.[353] Industries like tourism, accommodation and food and drink tend to be the lowest paid at \u00a38.91.[351] The top eight local authorities for pay by where people live are; East Renfrewshire (\u00a320.87GBP per hour), East Dunbartonshire (\u00a317.56GBP per hour), Renfrewshire (\u00a315.34GBP per hour), Edinburgh (\u00a315.26GBP per hour), South Lanarkshire (\u00a315.22GBP per hour), Stirling (\u00a314.96GBP per hour), the Shetland Isles (\u00a314.90GBP per hour), Glasgow (\u00a314.68GBP per hour), Na h-Eileanan Siar (\u00a314.68GBP per hour) and Midlothian (\u00a314.55GBP per hour).[354]\nThe top eight local authorities for pay based on where people work are; East Ayrshire (\u00a316.92GBP per hour), Edinburgh (\u00a315.64GBP per hour), Glasgow (\u00a315.35GBP per hour), Stirling (\u00a315.19GBP per hour), Aberdeen (\u00a315GBP per hour), Dundee (\u00a314.91GBP per hour), Perth and Kinross (\u00a314.84GBP per hour), the Shetland Isles (\u00a314.81GBP per hour), Na h-Eileanan Siar (\u00a314.81GBP per hour) and North Ayrshire (\u00a314.48GBP per hour). Scotland's cities commonly have the largest salaries in Scotland for where people work.[355] 2021/2022 date indicates that there were 2.6 million dwellings across Scotland, with 318,369 local authority dwellings.[356] Typical prices for a house in Scotland was \u00a3195,391GBP in August 2022.[357]\nBetween 2016 and 2020, the Scottish Government estimated that 10% of people in Scotland were in persistent poverty following housing costs, with similar rates of persistent poverty for children (10%), working-age adults (10%) and pensioners (11%).[358] Persistent child poverty rates had saw a relatively sharp drop, however, the accuracy of this was deemed to be questionable due to a number of various factors such as households re-entering the longitudanal sample allowing data gaps to be filled.[359] Poverty figures in Scotland were largely the same in the previous calculation period between 2015 and 2019.[360] 2021 Scottish Government analysis found that relative poverty rates had steadied following a period of small increases since the 1990s when it had been falling.[361] The income of households were found to be continuing to rise and fall, with the median household income continuing to rise.[362] It is estimated that 19% of Scotland's population (roughly 1.03 million people) were living in relative poverty after housing costs between 2017 and 2020, with 17% of the population estimated to be living in relative poverty before the deduction of housing costs in the same period.[363]\nChild poverty had been gradually rising by 2021 following a period of reduction between the late nineties and 2010, child poverty rates have been gradually rising again with an estimated 24% (240,000 children) living in relative poverty following housing costs, with an estimated 21% of children living in relative poverty before housing costs were deducted.[364] The Scottish Government introduced the Scottish Child Payment in 2021 for low income families with children under six years of age in an attempt to reduce child poverty rates, with families receiving a payment of roughly \u00a31,040GBP per year.[365]\nAlthough the Bank of England is the central bank for the UK, three Scottish clearing banks issue Sterling banknotes: the Bank of Scotland, the Royal Bank of Scotland and the Clydesdale Bank. The issuing of banknotes by retail banks in Scotland is subject to the Banking Act 2009, which repealed all earlier legislation under which banknote issuance was regulated, and the Scottish and Northern Ireland Banknote Regulations 2009.[366]\nThe value of the Scottish banknotes in circulation in 2013 was \u00a33.8\u00a0billion, underwritten by the Bank of England using funds deposited by each clearing bank, under the Banking Act 2009, in order to cover the total value of such notes in circulation.[367]\nScotland's primary sources for energy are provided through renewable energy (61.8%), nuclear (25.7%) and fossil fuel generation (10.9%).[368]\nIn Scotland, 98.6% of all electricity used was from renewable sources. This is minus net exports.[368] Between October 2021 and September 2022 63.1% of all electricity generated in Scotland was from renewable sources, 83.6% was classed as low carbon and 14.5% was from fossil fuels.[369]\nThe Scottish Government has a target to have the equivalent of 50% of the energy for Scotland's heat, transport and electricity consumption to be supplied from renewable sources by 2030.[370]\nScotland has five international airports operating scheduled services to Europe, North America and Asia, as well as domestic services to England, Northern Ireland and Wales.\nHighlands and Islands Airports operates eleven airports across the Highlands, Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles, which are primarily used for short distance, public service operations, although Inverness Airport has a number of scheduled flights to destinations across the UK and mainland Europe.\nEdinburgh Airport is currently Scotland's busiest airport handling over 13 million passengers in 2017.[371] It is also the UK's 6th busiest airport.\nBritish Airways, EasyJet, Jet2, and Ryanair operate the majority of flights between Scotland and other major UK and European airports.\nFour airlines are based in Scotland:\nNetwork Rail owns and operates the fixed infrastructure assets of the railway system in Scotland, while the Scottish Government retains overall responsibility for rail strategy and funding in Scotland.[372] Scotland's rail network has 359 railway stations and around 1,710 miles (2,760\u00a0km) of track.[373] In 2018\u201319 there were 102\u00a0million passenger journeys on Scottish railways.[374]\nThe East and West Coast Main Lines are the two cross-border railways that connect the networks of Scotland and England. London North Eastern Railway (LNER) provides inter-city rail journeys on the former between Inverness, Aberdeen and Edinburgh to London King's Cross via York, while Avanti West Coast runs services on the latter from either Edinburgh or Glasgow Central to London Euston with some services serving Birmingham New Street. TransPennine Express, Lumo, CrossCountry, Caledonian Sleeper and ScotRail also operate services to England. Domestic rail services within Scotland are operated by ScotRail. Glasgow's Subway is one of the four underground urban rail networks in the UK (the others being in London, Newcastle and Liverpool). Edinburgh has a tramway to and from the airport.\nDuring the time of British Rail, the West Coast Main Line from London Euston to Glasgow Central was electrified in the early 1970s, followed by the East Coast Main Line in the late 1980s. British Rail created the ScotRail brand. When British Rail existed, many railway lines in Strathclyde were electrified. Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive was at the forefront with the acclaimed \"largest electrified rail network outside London\". Some parts of the network are electrified, but there are no electrified lines in the Highlands, Angus, Aberdeenshire, the cities of Dundee or Aberdeen, or Perth & Kinross, and none of the islands have a rail link. Trains serving railheads such as Wemyss Bay, Kyle of Lochalsh and Mallaig are often timed to connect with ferries to some of Scotland's islands.\nThe Scottish motorways and major trunk roads are managed by Transport Scotland. The remainder of the road network is managed by the Scottish local authorities in each of their areas.\nRegular ferry services operate between the Scottish mainland and outlying islands. Ferries serving both the inner and outer Hebrides are principally operated by the state-owned enterprise Caledonian MacBrayne.\nServices to the Northern Isles are operated by Serco. Other routes, served by multiple companies, connect southwest Scotland to Northern Ireland. DFDS Seaways operated a freight-only Rosyth \u2013 Zeebrugge ferry service, until a fire damaged the vessel DFDS were using.[375] A passenger service was also operated between 2002 and 2010.[376]\nScottish music is a significant aspect of the nation's culture, with both traditional and modern influences. A famous traditional Scottish instrument is the Great Highland bagpipe, a woodwind reed instrument consisting of three drones and a melody pipe (called the chanter), which are fed continuously by a reservoir of air in a bag. The popularity of pipe bands\u2014primarily featuring bagpipes, various types of snares and drums, and showcasing Scottish traditional dress and music\u2014has spread throughout the world. Bagpipes are featured in holiday celebrations, parades, funerals, weddings, and other events internationally. Many military regiments have a pipe band of their own. In addition to the Great Highland pipes, several smaller, somewhat quieter bellows-blown varieties of bagpipe are played in Scotland, including the smallpipes and the Border pipes.\nThe cl\u00e0rsach (harp), piano, fiddle and piano accordion are some of the most popular traditional Scottish instruments, the latter two heavily featured in Scottish country dance bands.  The bodhr\u00e1n, popularised in Ireland in the 1960s, soon found its place within the Scottish musical tradition. Stringed instruments such as the guitar, mandolin, banjo and Irish bouzouki, free-reed instruments (such as the concertina and button accordion) all feature. The tin whistle is commonly featured and with its affinity to and technical similarities with the pipes, it is often played as an additional instrument by pipers.\nThere are many successful mainstream and popular Scottish bands and individual artists in varying styles including Annie Lennox, Amy Macdonald, Runrig, Belle and Sebastian, Boards of Canada, Camera Obscura, Capercaillie, Cocteau Twins, Deacon Blue, Franz Ferdinand, Susan Boyle, Emeli Sand\u00e9, Julie Fowlis, Alasdair Fraser, Aly Bain, Texas, The View, The Fratellis, Twin Atlantic, Bay City Rollers and Biffy Clyro. Other Scottish musicians include Shirley Manson (of the band Garbage), Paolo Nutini, Andy Stewart and Calvin Harris, all of whom have achieved considerable commercial success in international music markets[377] Shirley Manson performed at the 1999 opening of the Scottish Parliament concert at Princes Street Gardens with her band Garbage.[378]\nRock band Simple Minds were the most commercially successful Scottish band of the 1980s, having found success in international markets such as the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand,[379] whilst pop singer Lewis Capaldi was recognised as the best selling artist in the UK in 2019.[380]\nAwards in recognition of Scottish musical talent in Scotland include the Scottish Music Awards, Scottish Album of the Year Award, the Scots Trad Music Awards and the BBC Radio Scotland Young Traditional Musician award.\nScotland has a literary heritage dating back to the early Middle Ages. The earliest extant literature composed in what is now Scotland was in Brythonic speech in the 6th century, but is preserved as part of Welsh literature.[381] Later medieval literature included works in Latin,[382] Gaelic,[383] Old English[384] and French.[385] The first surviving major text in Early Scots is the 14th-century poet John Barbour's epic Brus, focusing on the life of Robert I,[386] and was soon followed by a series of vernacular romances and prose works.[387] In the 16th century, the crown's patronage helped the development of Scots drama and poetry,[388] but the accession of James VI to the English throne removed a major centre of literary patronage and Scots was sidelined as a literary language.[389] Interest in Scots literature was revived in the 18th century by figures including James Macpherson, whose Ossian Cycle made him the first Scottish poet to gain an international reputation and was a major influence on the European Enlightenment.[390] It was also a major influence on Robert Burns, whom many consider the national poet,[391] and Walter Scott, whose Waverley Novels did much to define Scottish identity in the 19th century.[392] Towards the end of the Victorian era a number of Scottish-born authors achieved international reputations as writers in English, including Robert Louis Stevenson, Arthur Conan Doyle, J. M. Barrie and George MacDonald.[393] In the 20th century the Scottish Renaissance saw a surge of literary activity and attempts to reclaim the Scots language as a medium for serious literature.[394] Members of the movement were followed by a new generation of post-war poets including Edwin Morgan, who would be appointed the first Scots Makar by the inaugural Scottish government in 2004.[395] From the 1980s Scottish literature enjoyed another major revival, particularly associated with a group of writers including Irvine Welsh.[394] Scottish poets who emerged in the same period included Carol Ann Duffy, who, in May 2009, was the first Scot named the monarch's Poet Laureate.[396]\nNational newspapers such as the Daily Record, The Herald, The Scotsman and The National are all produced in Scotland.[398] Important regional dailies include the Evening News in Edinburgh, The Courier in Dundee in the east, and The Press and Journal serving Aberdeen and the north.[398] Scotland is represented at the Celtic Media Festival, which showcases film and television from the Celtic countries. Scottish entrants have won many awards since the festival began in 1980.[399]\nTelevision in Scotland is largely the same as UK-wide broadcasts. The national broadcaster is BBC Scotland, a division of the BBC. It runs three national television stations BBC One Scotland, BBC Scotland channel and the Gaelic-language broadcaster BBC Alba, and the national radio stations, BBC Radio Scotland and BBC Radio nan G\u00e0idheal, amongst others. The main Scottish commercial television station is STV which broadcasts on two of the three ITV regions of Scotland.[400]\nScotland has a number of production companies which produce films and television programmes for Scottish, British and international audiences. Popular films associated with Scotland through Scottish production or being filmed in Scotland include Braveheart (1995),[401] Highlander (1986),[401] Trainspotting (1996),[401] Red Road (2006), Neds (2010),[401] The Angel's Share (2012), Brave (2012)[402] and Outlaw King (2018).[403] Popular television programmes associated with Scotland include the long running BBC Scotland soap opera River City which has been broadcast since 2002,[404] Still Game, a popular Scottish sitcom broadcast throughout the United Kingdom (2002\u20132007, revived in 2016),[405] Rab C. Nesbitt, Two Doors Down[406] and Take the High Road.[407] The Rig (2023) was the first Amazon Prime Video production to be filmed and produced entirely in Scotland.[408]\nWardpark Studios in Cumbernauld is one of Scotland's television and film production studios where the television programme Outlander is produced.[409] Dumbarton Studios, located in Dumbarton is largely used for BBC Scotland programming, used for the filming and production of television programmes such as Still Game, River City, Two Doors Down, and Shetland.[410]\nAs one of the Celtic nations, Scotland and Scottish culture are represented at inter-Celtic events at home and over the world. Scotland hosts several music festivals including Celtic Connections (Glasgow), and the Hebridean Celtic Festival (Stornoway). Festivals celebrating Celtic culture, such as Festival Interceltique de Lorient (Brittany), the Pan Celtic Festival (Ireland), and the National Celtic Festival (Portarlington, Australia), feature elements of Scottish culture such as language, music and dance.[411][412][413][414]\nThe image of St. Andrew, martyred while bound to an X-shaped cross, first appeared in the Kingdom of Scotland during the reign of William I.[415] Following the death of King Alexander III in 1286 an image of Andrew was used on the seal of the Guardians of Scotland who assumed control of the kingdom during the subsequent interregnum.[416] Use of a simplified symbol associated with Saint Andrew, the saltire, has its origins in the late 14th century; the Parliament of Scotland decreeing in 1385 that Scottish soldiers should wear a white Saint Andrew's Cross on the front and back of their tunics.[417] Use of a blue background for the Saint Andrew's Cross is said to date from at least the 15th century.[418] Since 1606 the saltire has also formed part of the design of the Union Flag. There are numerous other symbols and symbolic artefacts, both official and unofficial, including the thistle, the nation's floral emblem (celebrated in the song, The Thistle o' Scotland), the Declaration of Arbroath, incorporating a statement of political independence made on 6 April 1320, the textile pattern tartan that often signifies a particular Scottish clan and the royal Lion Rampant flag.[419][420][421] Highlanders can thank James Graham, 3rd Duke of Montrose, for the repeal in 1782 of the Act of 1747 prohibiting the wearing of tartans.[422]\nAlthough there is no official national anthem of Scotland,[423] Flower of Scotland is played on special occasions and sporting events such as football and rugby matches involving the Scotland national teams and since 2010 is also played at the Commonwealth Games after it was voted the overwhelming favourite by participating Scottish athletes.[424] Other currently less popular candidates for the National Anthem of Scotland include Scotland the Brave, Highland Cathedral, Scots Wha Hae and A Man's A Man for A' That.[425]\nSt Andrew's Day, 30 November, is the national day, although Burns' Night tends to be more widely observed, particularly outside Scotland. In 2006, the Scottish Parliament passed the St Andrew's Day Bank Holiday (Scotland) Act 2007, designating the day an official bank holiday.[426] Tartan Day is a recent innovation from Canada.[427]\nThe national animal of Scotland is the unicorn, which has been a Scottish heraldic symbol since the 12th century.[428]\nScottish cuisine has distinctive attributes and recipes of its own but shares much with wider British and European cuisine as a result of local and foreign influences, both ancient and modern. Traditional Scottish dishes exist alongside international foodstuffs brought about by migration. Scotland's natural larder of game, dairy products, fish, fruit, and vegetables is the chief factor in traditional Scots cooking, with a high reliance on simplicity and a lack of spices from abroad, as these were historically rare and expensive. Irn-Bru is the most common Scottish carbonated soft drink, often described as \"Scotland's other national drink\" (after whisky).[429] During the Late Middle Ages and early modern era, French cuisine played a role in Scottish cookery due to cultural exchanges brought about by the \"Auld Alliance\",[430] especially during the reign of Mary, Queen of Scots. Mary, on her return to Scotland, brought an entourage of French staff who are considered responsible for revolutionising Scots cooking and for some of Scotland's unique food terminology.[431]\nScotland hosts its own national sporting competitions and has independent representation at several international sporting events, including the FIFA World Cup, the UEFA Nations League, the UEFA European Championship, the Rugby Union World Cup, the Rugby League World Cup, the Cricket World Cup, the Netball World Cup and the Commonwealth Games. Scotland has its own national governing bodies, such as the Scottish Football Association (the second oldest national football association in the world)[432] and the Scottish Rugby Union. Variations of football have been played in Scotland for centuries, with the earliest reference dating back to 1424.[433]\nThe world's first official international association football match was held in 1872 and was the idea of C. W. Alcock of the Football Association which was seeking to promote Association Football in Scotland.[434][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] The match took place at the West of Scotland Cricket Club's Hamilton Crescent ground in the Partick area of Glasgow. The match was between Scotland and England and resulted in a 0\u20130 draw. Following this, the newly developed football became the most popular sport in Scotland. The Scottish Cup was first contested in 1873. Queen's Park F.C., in Glasgow, is probably the oldest association football club in the world outside England.[435][436]\nThe Scottish Football Association (SFA), the second-oldest national football association in the world, is the main governing body for Scottish association football, and a founding member of the International Football Association Board (IFAB) which governs the Laws of the Game. As a result of this key role in the development of the sport Scotland is one of only four countries to have a permanent representative on the IFAB; the other four representatives being appointed for set periods by FIFA.[citation needed][437]\nThe SFA also has responsibility for the Scotland national football team, whose supporters are commonly known as the \"Tartan Army\". As of December 2019[update], Scotland are ranked as the 50th best national football team in the FIFA World Rankings.[438] The national team last attended the World Cup in France in 1998, but finished last in their group stage.[439] The Scotland women's team have achieved more recent success, qualifying for both Euro 2017[440] and the 2019 World Cup.[441] As of December 2019[update], they were ranked as the 22nd best women's national team in the FIFA Rankings.[442]\nScottish clubs have achieved some success in European competitions, with Celtic winning the European Cup in 1967, Rangers and Aberdeen winning the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1972 and 1983 respectively, and Aberdeen also winning the UEFA Super Cup in 1983. Celtic, Rangers and Dundee United have also reached European finals. The most recent appearance by a Scottish club in a European final was by Rangers in 2022.[443][444]\nWith the modern game of golf originating in 15th-century Scotland, the country is promoted as the home of golf.[445][446][447] To many golfers the Old Course in the Fife town of St Andrews, an ancient links course dating to before 1552,[448] is considered a site of pilgrimage.[449] In 1764, the standard 18-hole golf course was created at St Andrews when members modified the course from 22 to 18 holes.[450] The world's oldest golf tournament, and golf's first major, is The Open Championship, which was first played on 17 October 1860 at Prestwick Golf Club, in Ayrshire, Scotland, with Scottish golfers winning the earliest majors.[451] There are many other famous golf courses in Scotland, including Carnoustie, Gleneagles, Muirfield, and Royal Troon.\nThe Scottish Football Union was founded on Monday 3 March 1873 at a meeting held at Glasgow Academy, Elmbank Street, Glasgow.[452] The Scottish Rugby Union is the second oldest rugby union in the world. In 1924 the SFU changed its name to become the Scottish Rugby Union.[453] International games were played at Inverleith from 1899 to 1925 when Murrayfield was opened.\nThe SRU owns Murrayfield Stadium which is the main home ground of the Scottish national team. Scotland is represented in rugby tournaments by the Scotland national rugby union team. As of 4 December 2022, Scotland are 7th in the World Rugby Rankings.[454] The Scotland rugby team played their first official test match, winning 1\u20130 against England at Raeburn Place in 1871. Scotland has competed in the Six Nations from the inaugural tournament in 1883, winning it 14 times outright\u2014including the last Five Nations in 1999\u2014and sharing it another 8. The Rugby World Cup was introduced in 1987 and Scotland have competed in all nine competitions, the most recent being in 2019, where they failed to reach the quarter-finals. Their best finish came in 1991, where they lost to the All Blacks in the third place play-off.\nScotland competes with the England rugby team annually for the Calcutta Cup. Each year, this fixture is played out as part of the Six Nations, with Scotland having last won in 2023.\nOther distinctive features of the national sporting culture include the Highland games, curling and shinty. In boxing, Scotland has had 13 world champions, including Ken Buchanan, Benny Lynch and Jim Watt. Scotland has also been successful in motorsport, particularly in Formula One. Notable drivers include; David Coulthard, Jim Clark, Paul Di Resta, and Jackie Stewart.[455] In IndyCar, Dario Franchitti has won 4 consecutive IndyCar world championships.[456]\nScotland has competed at every Commonwealth Games since 1930 and has won 356 medals in total\u201491 Gold, 104 Silver and 161 Bronze.[457] Edinburgh played host to the Commonwealth Games in 1970 and 1986, and most recently Glasgow in 2014.[458]\nCoordinates: 57\u00b0N 4\u00b0W\ufeff / \ufeff57\u00b0N 4\u00b0W\ufeff / 57; -4", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland#cite_note-426", "

Wikipedia": {"text": "Education in Scotland is the responsibility of the Scottish Government, and is overseen by its executive agency, Education Scotland.\nEducation in Scotland has a history of universal provision of public education, and the Scottish education system is distinctly different from those in the other countries of the United Kingdom. The Scotland Act 1998 gives the Scottish Parliament legislative control over all education matters, and the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 is the principal legislation governing education in Scotland. Traditionally, the Scottish system at secondary school level has emphasised breadth across a range of subjects, while the English, Welsh and Northern Irish systems have emphasised greater depth of education over a smaller range of subjects.\nFollowing this, Scottish universities generally have courses a year longer (typically 4 years) than their counterparts elsewhere in the UK, though it is often possible for students to take more advanced specialised exams and join the courses at the second year. One unique aspect is that the ancient universities of Scotland issue a Master of Arts as the first degree in humanities. State schools are owned and operated by the local authorities which act as Education Authorities, and the compulsory phase is divided into primary school and secondary school (often called high school). Schools are supported in delivering learning and teaching by Education Scotland (formerly Learning and Teaching Scotland). There are also private schools across the country, although the distribution is uneven with such schools in 22 of the 32 Local Authority areas. At September 2011 the total pupil population in Scotland was 702,104, of which 31,425 pupils, or 4.5%, were being educated in independent schools.[4]\nQualifications at the secondary school and post-secondary (further education) level are provided by the Scottish Qualifications Authority, which is the national awarding and accrediting body in Scotland, and delivered through various schools, colleges and other centres. Political responsibility for education at all levels is vested in the Scottish Parliament and the Learning Directorate.[5] Inspections and audits of educational standards are conducted by three bodies: Care Inspectorate inspects care standards in pre-school provision; Education Scotland (formerly Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education) for pre-school, primary, education, further and community education; with the Scottish office of the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA Scotland) responsible for higher education.\nThe Programme for International Student Assessment coordinated by the OECD currently ranks Scotland as the lowest in the UK, behind England, with its results steadly dropping in reading, maths, and science.[6] In 2014, research by the Office for National Statistics found that Scotland was the most highly educated country in Europe and among the most well-educated in the world in terms of tertiary education attainment, above countries like Finland, Ireland and Luxembourg, with roughly 40% of Scots aged 16\u201364 educated to NVQ level 4 and above.[7]\nChildren start primary school aged between 4\u00bd and 5\u00bd depending on when the child's birthday falls.[8] Scottish school policy places all those born between March of a given year and February of the following year in the same year group. Children born between March and August start school in August at between 5 and 5\u00bd years old, and those born between September and February start school in the previous August at between age 4\u00bd and 4 years 11 months years old. The Scottish system is the most flexible in the UK, however, as parents of children born between September and December can decide to defer for 1 year (but may or may not receive a funded nursery place in the deferral year), whilst children born between January and February can opt to hold their child back a year and let them start school the following August, with guaranteed nursery funding. This usually allows those not ready for formal education to have an extra year at an early years centre (formerly known as nursery).\nPupils remain at primary school for seven years. Then aged eleven or twelve, they start secondary school for a compulsory four years with the following two years being optional. In Scotland, pupils sit National 4/5 exams (previously Standard Grade or Intermediate exams) at the age of fifteen/sixteen, normally for between 6 and eight subjects including compulsory exams in English and Mathematics. A Science subject (Physics, Biology or Chemistry) and a Social Subject (Geography, History or Modern Studies) were also compulsory, but this was changed in accordance with the new curriculum. It is now required by the Scottish Parliament for students to have two hours of physical education a week; each school may vary these compulsory combinations. The school leaving age is generally sixteen (after completion of National 4/5s), after which students may choose to remain at school and study for Higher and/or Advanced Higher exams.\nA small number of students at certain private, private schools may follow the English system and study towards GCSE instead of National 4/5s (Standard Grades), and towards A and AS-Levels instead of (or alongside) Higher Grade and Advanced Higher exams. The International Baccalaureate has also been introduced in some independent schools.\nThe table below lists rough equivalences with the year system in the rest of the United Kingdom (For England and Wales, the equivalence given is for children born before 1 September; the equivalence for those born from September to February [December for deferred pupils] is given in brackets):\nGovernment funded schools are free for children aged 5\u201319.[9] In many cases, this applies to children of international post-graduate students,[10] and other immigrants.\nThe age ranges specify the youngest age for a child entering that year and the oldest age for a child leaving that year. Playgroup can be described as a daycare centre for toddlers, then children may go on to attend an early years centre as soon as they have passed their third birthday, and progress to Primary 1 in the August of the year in which they turn five.\nIn general, the cut-off point for ages is the end of February, so all children must be of a certain age on 1 March to begin class in August.\nAll parents of children born between September and February (i.e. still 4 years old on the school start date) are entitled to defer entry to Primary School if they believe their child is not ready for school.\nOnly children whose birthdays fall in January or February will be considered for funding for a subsequent year at an early years centre, unless there are special circumstances.\nChildren may leave school once they reach their statutory school leaving date; this is dependent on date of birth.  For children born between 1 March and 30 September, this date is 31 May of their 4th year of secondary school.  For children born between 1 October and 28 February, the last day of June is the first date they may leave school if they have a placement at college and the school have signed the health & safety forms.\nWhich high school the children go to depends on the area where they live, known as the \"catchment area\", which has a specific high school that takes children who live in that area.\nParents can also apply for a placement request if they would like their child to attend a school outside their catchment area and a panel will decide if the child is the most worthy (out of all placing requests) to take one of the spaces left after all children from the catchment area have been taken.\nThe table below lists list the numbers of children, schools and teachers in all publicly funded schools:[11]\nHome education is also legal in Scotland. Parents wishing to home educate do not need the permission of the Local Authority unless the children are already registered at a school. There are no exact numbers available for children being educated at home in Scotland.[13]\nWithin the Scottish Government, the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills has overall responsibility for education provision in Scotland. The Cabinet Secretary is assisted by three junior ministers, currently the Minister for Childcare and Early Years, the Minister for Further Education, Higher Education and Science and the Minister for Employability and Training.[14]\nAll educational qualifications in Scotland are part of the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework, ranging between Scottish Qualifications Authority qualifications, Scottish Vocational Qualifications and higher education qualifications.\nProgression in Qualifications\nThe vast majority of Scottish pupils take Scottish Qualifications Certificate qualifications provided by the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA). Generally, most pupils take National 4/5s (previously Standard Grades, but some schools offered Intermediates instead) in S3-S4, and Highers in S5. The number of National 4/5 qualifications a pupil enters can vary drastically depending on the individual, with the most common number of National 5s taken, per pupil, in 2017 being 6,[17] however some may choose to undertake as few as one or two, up to eight or nine. For those who wish to remain at school for the final year (S6), more Highers and Advanced Highers (formerly CSYS) in S6 can be taken. Previous qualifications Intermediate 1 and Intermediate 2 \u2013 were intended to be roughly equivalent to General and Credit Level Standard Grades respectively.\nPupils can go to university at the end of S5, as Highers provide the entry requirements for Scottish universities where degrees are normally four years long; however, recently it is more common for students to remain until S6, taking further Highers and/or taking Advanced Highers. The majority of English universities, the most popular choice for Scottish students who wish to study university degrees outside of Scotland, require Advanced Higher qualification levels as these are deemed by the English universities to be most similar to A-levels.\nSecondary education is provided by secondary schools throughout Scotland, both in the state and independent sector. The vast majority of schools in the state sector are administered directly by the local Education Authority, which is synonymous with the 32 councils used for local government.[18]\nThere are three broad classifications of schools in Scotland:[19]\nThere is not a set name for secondary schools in Scotland, but whatever they might be called, with just a few specific exceptions in mainly rural or island authorities, state secondary schools in Scotland are fully comprehensive and non-selective. Amongst the state-run secondary schools:\nOther schools include The Community School of Auchterarder, Auchterarder, Perth and Kinross; The Nicolson Institute, Stornoway, Western Isles; North Walls Community School on Hoy, Orkney Islands and Wester Hailes Education Centre, Wester Hailes, Edinburgh. All of these are, equally, fully comprehensive non-selective schools, differing only in designation from all other state secondary schools in Scotland.\nUnlike England's nationally followed National Curriculum, Scotland had no national standards for some time. In 2003, work began on an education reform programme, to produce a new Curriculum for Excellence that would replace existing guidance on the school curriculum.[20] Curriculum for Excellence was launched in Scottish secondary schools from school session 2012\u20132013. In 2017, new reforms were introduced moving control over curriculum and schools more towards head teachers and parents.[21][22]\nA review was undertaken by the OECD, having been commissioned by the Scottish Government to look at the broad general education.[23]\nThe majority of schools are non-denominational, and include the parish schools, pioneered by the Church of Scotland and other Protestant Churches, which became state schools in 1872. Religious education is taught in non-denominational schools and in denominational schools. Of over 2,500 schools in Scotland, there are 366 state schools which are Roman Catholic, three Episcopalian and one Jewish. The Education (Scotland) Act 1918 brought Roman Catholic schools within the State education system, ensuring the promotion of a Roman Catholic ethos within such schools.[24]\nIn 2015, the Scottish Government launched the Scottish Attainment Challenge which aims to achieve equity in educational outcomes throughout Scotland. The Scottish Government envisages equity being achieved by ensuring every child has the same opportunity to succeed, with a particular focus on closing the poverty-related attainment gap. It is underpinned by national Scottish educational policies such as Curriculum for Excellence, Getting it Right for Every Child (GIRFEC) as well as the National Improvement Framework.[25] The attainment challenge focuses and accelerates targeted improvement activity in literacy, numeracy and health and wellbeing in specific areas of Scotland, known as \"challenge authorities\" (those councils with a higher percentage of children growing up in poverty and deprivation). At a cost of \u00a3750 million to the Scottish Government through the Attainment Scotland Fund, the challenge is a targeted initiative focused on supporting pupils in the local authorities of Scotland with the highest concentrations of deprivation. Currently, the nine 'Challenge Authorities' are Glasgow City Council, Dundee City Council, Inverclyde, West Dunbartonshire, North Ayrshire, Clackmannanshire, North Lanarkshire, East Ayrshire and Renfrewshire.[25]\nOn 1 February 2017 the share each primary and secondary school will receive for the academic year 2017\u20132018 from the Scottish Government's \u00a3120 million Pupil Equity Funding was announced by the Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills John Swinney.  This funding is provided through the Attainment Scotland Fund and allocated directly to schools, targeted at those children most affected by the poverty related attainment gap.[25]\nThe SNP-led government launched the Scottish Survey of Literacy and Numeracy in 2011.[26] The survey showed a sustained decline in basic literacy and numeracy among school pupils over six years.[27] It was then scrapped by the government and its measures of literacy were replaced in part with a system based on teacher judgements.[26] The teacher judgement data from December 2018 indicated that 70% of pupils achieved the expected literacy level by the end of primary school.[26]\nThe government withdrew Scotland from the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study in 2010, making international comparisons of literacy difficult.[28] It remains part of the Programme for International Student Assessment, which shows that Scotland's international standing in reading and mathematics (as well as science) in schools fell between the first decade of the century and 2018.[28]\nThe Scottish Survey of Adult Literacies in 2009 reported that 26.7% of adults in Scotland \"may face occasional challenges and constrained opportunities due to their literacies difficulties, but will generally cope with their day-to-day lives\". Of that group, 3.6% \"face serious challenges in their literacies practices\".[29]\nMusic education is available at several levels. Formal music education begins at 4\u00bd years and can progress as high as postgraduate studies. Music education can take place within a Scottish Music school; through a music service or privately.\nSome schools in Scotland provide education given in the Scottish Gaelic language. They are mainly located in the main cities of Scotland and in areas with higher amounts of Gaelic speakers. Gaelic medium education is becoming increasingly popular throughout Scotland, and the number of pupils who are in Gaelic medium education at primary school level has risen from 24 in 1985, to 2500 in the 2012\u201313 school year.[30]\nFurther education is provided through a network of further education colleges available to people having reached the end of compulsory education at 16. In the early 2010s, colleges were merged to form larger, regional institutions.\nColleges offer a wide range of vocational qualifications to young people and older adults, including vocational, competency-based qualifications (previously known as SVQs), Higher National Certificates and Higher National Diplomas. In Scotland, FE college students receiving certain qualifications - frequently HNC and HND qualifications in a relevant subject - can apply for entry at a later stage at university.\nFurther education colleges also provide support to apprenticeship programmes, which are coordinated by the public body Skills Development Scotland.\nThere are fifteen universities in Scotland and three other institutions of higher education which have the authority to award academic degrees.[31] The oldest is St. Andrews, which was founded in 1413. Three other \"ancient universities\", Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh, date from before 1600.[32] The University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI) gained full university status in 2011, having been created through the federation of 13 colleges and research institutions across the Highlands and Islands, a process that began in 2001.[33]\nAll Scottish universities have the power to award degrees at all levels: undergraduate, taught postgraduate, and doctoral. Education in Scotland is controlled by the Scottish Government under the terms of the Scotland Act 1998. The minister responsible for higher education is the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills, currently John Swinney MSP of the Scottish National Party.[34] University status in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom today is conferred by the Privy Council which takes advice from the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education.[35][36]\nAll Scottish universities are public universities and funded by the Scottish Government (through its Scottish Funding Council[37]) and financial support is provided for Scottish-domiciled students by the Student Awards Agency for Scotland. Students ordinarily resident in Scotland or the European Union do not pay tuition fees for their first undergraduate degree, but tuition fees are charged for those from the rest of the United Kingdom. All students are required to pay tuition fees for postgraduate education (e.g. MSc, PhD), except in certain priority areas funded by the Scottish Government, or if another source of funding can be found (e.g. research council studentship for a PhD). A representative body called Universities Scotland works to promote Scotland's universities, as well as six other higher education institutions.[38]\nThe university sector in Scotland had a total income of \u00a33.5 billion in 2014/15 with the Scottish Government giving approximately \u00a3623 million in funding for individual university student support. The Scottish Funding Council contributing \u00a31.1 billion of public money to the fifteen universities, this was a six per cent reduction since 2010/11.[39]\nIn 2014\u201315, approximately 232,570 students studied at universities or institutes of higher education in Scotland, of which 56% were female and 44% male, with 66% being domiciled in Scotland, 12% from the rest of the United Kingdom, 9% from the EU and the remaining 13% being international students. Of all these, approximately 76% were studying for their first degree (i.e. undergraduate level) and 24% for a taught postgraduate degree (primarily a master's degree) or a doctoral research degree (primarily PhD). The remainder were mostly on other programmes such as Higher National Diploma.[39] 16,000 students were studying in Scotland with The Open University via distance-learning, and the Open University teaches 40 per cent of Scotland's part-time undergraduates.[40]\nIn the 2019 QS World University Rankings, three Scottish universities are among the top 100 worldwide: University of Edinburgh (at 18), University of Glasgow (at 69), University of St. Andrews (at 97). Other high ranked universities are the University of Aberdeen (at 172), University of Strathclyde (at 268), University of Dundee (at 272), Heriot-Watt University (at 302) and University of Stirling (at 417).[41]", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Scotland", " https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scotland#bodyContent", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page",

independent public prosecution service for Scotland, and is a Ministerial Department of the Scottish Government. The department is headed by His Majesty's Lord Advocate, who under the Scottish legal system is responsible for prosecution, along with the area procurators fiscal. In Scotland, virtually all prosecution of criminal offences is undertaken by the Crown. Private prosecutions are extremely rare.\nThe Service's responsibilities extend to the whole of Scotland, and include:\nThe Lord Advocate is assisted by the Solicitor General for Scotland, both Law Officers. The day-to-day running of the Service is done by the Crown Agent & Chief Executive and an executive board who are based in the service headquarters at Crown Office in Chambers Street, Edinburgh.\nThe Service employs both civil servants who carry out administrative and other duties and solicitors and advocates who represent the Crown in Court.\nThe history of the Lord Advocate, and the resulting department of the Crown Office, is somewhat obscure. There are references on record to a king's procurator-fiscal in 1434 and 1457, and a queen's advocate in 1462.  An office of king's advocate dates from 1478 but between 1478 and 1494 there are references to \"advocates\" (unnamed) and it is only from 1494 that one can be sure that there was a single king's advocate as the normal representative of the king in treason trials and in civil litigation.  The office thus dates back to Medieval times, with the earliest Lord Advocate being John Ross of Montgrenan whom the King appointed as his commissioner at a hearing in Stirling in 1476, then as procurator for another case in Edinburgh in the following year.[3]\nThe history of the procurator fiscal is similarly difficult to set down with exactness, though the role has developed significantly over time. The first document reference appears in the Records of the Parliament of Scotland for 22 August 1584, naming several procurators fiscal in Edinburgh. The fiscal was an officer appointed by, and accountable to, the Sheriff, who by the 18th Century was responsible for most prosecutions in local areas. By the nineteenth century advocates depute were first appointed, to assist him in conducting cases in the High Court of Justiciary and the Crown Office was first established. This became the centre of the prosecution system, and it was to the Lord Advocate now to whom the procurators fiscal were responsible, evidenced by the \"Book of Regulations\" issued by him to procurators fiscal providing instructions about how to conduct their business.[4] The Book of Regulations is still used today in providing the framework for local prosecution in Scotland.[5]\nAs well as departmental management responsibility, the Lord Advocate is directly responsible for prosecuting the most serious crimes, in the High Court of Justiciary at first instance and the Court of Criminal Appeal. Unless the cases are of especial importance, such as the Lockerbie trial held at Camp Zeist in the Netherlands, the prosecutions are normally (but not always) led by Advocates Depute who are known collectively as Crown Counsel and are experienced members of the Faculty of Advocates normally appointed for a limited period of three years. Their decision to prosecute in this way is taken in the light of the Procurator Fiscal's recommendations and a report prepared by the police, and any such reports are subject to the direction of the Lord Advocate.[6] This prosecutorial role can not be removed from her by the Scottish Parliament.\nThe Lord Advocate is the senior of the two Scottish Law Officers, and is the chief legal adviser to the Scottish Government as well as representing its ministers in civil proceedings.[7] He is also responsible under the Scotland Act 1998 for ensuring that each Act of the Scottish Parliament is within the competence of that Parliament. Additionally, the Lord Advocate, along with the Solicitor General for Scotland are ex-officio entitled to participate (but not vote) in proceedings of the Scottish Parliament to the extent permitted by standing orders.[8] The Solicitor General can act as the deputy for the Lord Advocate.\nThe Lord Advocate and Solicitor General are one of the Great Officers of State in Scotland, and the Lord Advocate is one of the Scottish Ministers, though since 23 May 2007 the Lord Advocate has not attended the cabinet of the Scottish Government. The position of Lord Advocate has been the subject of controversy, most notably sparked by Scottish High Court judges, wanting the ministerial and prosecutorial role to be separated.[9]\nThe Crown Agent is the principal legal adviser to the Lord Advocate on prosecution matters. He also acts as Chief Executive for the Department.  He acts as solicitor in all legal proceedings in which the Lord Advocate appears as representing his or her own department.  He issues general instructions from and on behalf of the Lord Advocate for the guidance of Crown counsel, procurators fiscal, sheriff clerks and other public officials, transmits instructions from Crown counsel to procurators fiscal about prosecutions, and, subject to the direction of the Principal Clerk of Justiciary, arranges sittings of the High Court of Justiciary. At trials in the High Court in Edinburgh, he attends as instructing solicitor.\nThe Crown Agent also holds the office of King's and Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer, and all property that falls to the Crown as a result of bona vacantia in Scotland is his responsibility, as is treasure trove. The post of KLTR was created in 1837 by the amalgamation of two existing posts created in 1707 \u2013 the King's/Queen's Remembrancer and the Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer, and has been held since 1981 by the holder of the office of Crown Agent.[10]\nAt the High Court of Justiciary prosecutions are brought by the Crown Office, who are represented in Court by Advocates Depute. Advocates Depute are either advocates or solicitor-advocates to whom rights of audience in the High Court have been given by that Court.\nFor the majority of crimes in Scotland a procurator fiscal or fiscal depute presents the case for the prosecution in the sheriff court and justice of the peace courts, and the case for the defence is presented either by the accused's own solicitor or by one from the Public Defence Solicitors' Office, a part of the Scottish Legal Aid Board.\nProcurators fiscal make preliminary investigations into criminal cases, take written statements from witnesses (known as precognition) and are responsible for the investigation and prosecution of crime. This includes the power to direct the police in their investigation, but except for serious crimes such as murder the police normally complete their enquiries before involving the procurator fiscal.[11][12][13] Once someone has been charged with an offence and remanded in custody, the Crown must bring the case to trial within 110 days or the accused will be admitted to bail. Otherwise, in serious cases (known as solemn procedure with a jury as opposed to summary procedure without) the trial must commence within 12 months of the date of first appearance in court.[14]\nProcurators fiscal work in the local sheriffdom and most of the fiscal offices in Scotland are either in or near the sheriff court. The procurator fiscal is also responsible for the investigation of all sudden, suspicious and unexplained deaths in Scotland. This includes the decision to call a fatal accident inquiry. He or she is also responsible for the independent investigation of criminal police complaints made in that sherrifdom (administrative complaints are handled by the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (PIRC)).\nThe law in Scotland does not say that a crime must be prosecuted and the procurators fiscals have considerable discretion over what action to take.  They can choose the level at which to prosecute (either through solemn or summary procedure) with the accused having no right to choose a jury trial or for a victim to decide whether or not to press charges, as the decision on whether to try and by which method belongs to the prosecutor as \"Master of the Instance\".[15][16][17] Until 1987, however, their discretion only extended to the degree to which they should prosecute, if at all; there were no alternatives to prosecution.  The Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1987 gave procurators fiscal the power to offer fixed penalties instead of prosecution (a fiscal fine), at the time limited to a maximum of \u00a325 and subsequently increased to \u00a3300.[18][19][20]\nSince then these options have expanded to giving a warning, fiscal fines, compensation orders, work orders, road traffic fixed penalties or diversion from prosecution into social work, psychological counselling or psychiatric treatment.[21]\nCOPFS is organised into three geographic Federations led by Procurators Fiscal for the North, East and West of Scotland.\nWithin the federations, there is a network of 37 Procurator Fiscal offices (including the Crown Office).[22]\nVictim Information and Advice Service (VIA) is a dedicated and specialised victim information and advice service within the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service.  VIA was created to provide information to victims, bereaved next of kin and keeping them informed about the progress of a case. It also has a duty to advise on and facilitate referral to other agencies for specialist support and counselling as required.[23] VIA works closely with other statutory agencies, such as the Police and the Courts and with voluntary organisations, such as Court Witness Service, Women's Aid and Victim Support, and is a unique service in the Scottish criminal justice system.", "links":

Kingdom that made legal provision for a consultative referendum to be held in the United Kingdom and Gibraltar, on whether it should remain a member state of the European Union or leave the bloc altogether.[1][2]  The Bill was introduced to the House of Commons by Philip Hammond, Foreign Secretary on 28 May 2015.[3] Two weeks later, the second reading of the Bill was supported by MPs from all parties except the SNP;[4] the Bill subsequently passed on its third reading in the Commons on 7 September 2015.[5] It was approved by the House of Lords on 14 December 2015,[6] and given Royal Assent on 17 December 2015. The Act came partly into force on the same day and came into full legal force on 1 February 2016.\nThe Act gave effect to a manifesto commitment of the Conservative Party at the general election of May 2015, and was one of the most significant pieces of legislation that was passed by the 2015\u201317 Parliament. It required the Secretary of State to appoint the day on which the referendum should be held, although it could not be any later than 31 December 2017 and, on 20 February 2016, David Cameron announced that the referendum would take place on 23 June 2016. In the referendum, the electorate voted by 51.9 per cent to 48.1 per cent in favour of leaving the EU, on a 72 per cent national turnout.\nThe Act became spent upon the conclusion of the referendum.\nOn 1 January 1973, the United Kingdom and Gibraltar joined what was then known as the European Communities, under terms negotiated by the then Conservative Prime Minister Edward Heath.[7] In accordance with British constitutional convention, specifically that of parliamentary sovereignty, accession was not subject to approval by referendum. Both the Conservative Party and the Labour Party were divided over the issue, and the European Communities Act 1972 was passed due to sufficient Labour abstentions to counteract the number of rebel Tories.[8] In the run-up to the February 1974 general election, the Labour Party manifesto promised a referendum \"on renegotiated terms\", which its leader Harold Wilson hoped would end the division of his party.[8] However, the election proved indecisive, and marked the end of Heath's premiership as Prime Minister; Wilson became PM, and called a second election later in the year. After the October 1974 general election, the Labour Party formed a minority administration and held the referendum on continued membership the following year, which was approved by 67% of voters.\nFor a few years the issue was largely settled but, with the approval by Parliament of the Single European Act, the Maastricht Treaty and the Lisbon Treaty, there were calls from eurosceptic Members of Parliament for a new UK referendum on continued membership. Conservative Party leader David Cameron announced in January 2013, in what became known as \"The Bloomberg speech\",[9] a proposal to undertake a renegotiation of the terms of the UK's membership of the EU, and subsequently to hold a UK referendum on its membership of the Union. However, at the time of Cameron's speech, the Conservative Party was in Coalition government with the Liberal Democrats who, along with the Labour Party, were at the time opposed to any new referendum being held. The Conservative Party did not have an overall majority and a private member's bill by Conservative MP James Wharton to legislate an in-out referendum by the end of 2017 was blocked in the House of Lords. The proposals were contained in the Conservative Party manifesto for the 2015 United Kingdom general election; the Labour and Lib Dem parties had also made manifesto commitments to an EU referendum.[10] On the Bill's second reading, on 9 June 2015, MPs voted by 544 to 53 in favour of the principle of holding a referendum with only the Scottish National Party opposing the Bill,[11] and by 316 votes to 53 on its third reading in the Commons on 7 September 2015.[5]\nThe Act legislated for a referendum to be held in the United Kingdom and Gibraltar on whether to remain a member of the EU, to be conducted by the Electoral Commission and overseen by an appointed \"Chief Counting Officer\" (CCO) and a \"deputy chief counting officer\" (DCCO) who declared the final result for the United Kingdom. By regulation the Act ordered the Secretary of State (in this case the Prime Minister) to appoint a date for the holding of the referendum, as long as the date was no later than 31 December 2017, and not on 5 May 2016 or 4 May 2017. The Electoral Commission is the public body under the terms of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 that was given the task to raise public awareness ahead of polling day, and to oversee the conduct of the referendum.\nThis Act required a referendum to be held on the question of the UK's continued membership of the European Union before the end of 2017. The Bill did not contain any requirement for the UK Government to implement the results of the referendum, nor set a time limit by which a vote to leave the EU should be implemented.  Instead, this was a type of referendum known as a pre-legislative or consultative referendum, which enables the electorate to voice an opinion which then influences the Government in its policy decisions. The referendums held in Scotland (1997), Wales (1997) and Northern Ireland (1998) are examples of this type, where opinion was tested before legislation was introduced. The UK does not have constitutional provisions which would require the results of a referendum to be implemented, unlike, for example, Ireland, where the circumstances in which a binding referendum should be held are set out in its constitution.\nIn contrast, the legislation which provided for the referendum held on AV in May 2011 would have implemented the new system of voting without further legislation, provided that the boundary changes also provided for in the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011 were also implemented. In the event, there was a substantial majority against any change. The 1975 referendum was held after the re-negotiated terms of the UK's EC membership had been agreed by all EC Member States and the terms set out in a command paper which later became known as the Referendum Act 1975 and was passed by both Houses.[12]\nThe Bill became law when it received Royal Assent on 17 December 2015.\nIn accordance with the Act and the public duty of the Electoral Commission, a guide was posted to every household in the UK and Gibraltar in the week beginning of 16 May 2016 by HM Government. The leaflet was titled: \"Why the Government believes that voting to remain in the European Union is the best decision for the UK\". This leaflet stated: \"This is your decision. The government will implement what you decide\".[13]\nThe Act legislated that the official referendum campaign period up until polling day would be of ten weeks' duration (which in the event ran from 15 April to 23 June 2016), with an official \"purdah\" period lasting four weeks (in the event running from 27 May until polling day) during which all government and public bodies were not permitted to comment or publish information specifically related to the subject of the referendum.\nUnder this Act and the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, the Electoral Commission had the authority to designate and to provide funding for two official lead campaign groups, one for \"Remain\" and one for \"Leave\". Each designated group had access to grants worth up to \u00a3600,000 as well as television spots and free leaflet drops.  The Act declared that these designated groups were not permitted to spend overall more than \u00a37\u00a0million. The Act permitted other registered campaign groups to participate but that their overall spending was limited to a maximum of \u00a3700,000. Spending by unregistered groups was limited by the Act to a maximum of \u00a310,000. The Electoral Commission announced the official \"Remain\" and \"Leave\" designated groups before the beginning of the official campaign period (on 13 April 2016) ahead of the deadline on 14 April 2016: Britain Stronger in Europe for \"Remain\" and Vote Leave for \"Leave\".\nUnder the Act and the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, political parties were permitted to provide funding for the referendum, although their spending was limited according to their performance at the 2015 general election and, under the rules, the political parties were limited to the maximum of each amount as follows:\nAll other political parties who received less than 5% of the national vote share had their maximum spending limited to no more than \u00a3700,000.\nUnless individuals are officially registered with the Electoral Commission, the maximum limit for spending in the referendum was to be no more than \u00a310,000.[14]\nThe question that appeared on ballot papers in the referendum before the electorate under the Act was (in English):\nShould the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?\nwith the responses to the question to be marked with a single (X):\nRemain a member of the European Union\nLeave the European Union\nand in Welsh:\nA ddylai'r Deyrnas Unedig aros yn aelod o'r Undeb Ewropeaidd neu adael yr Undeb Ewropeaidd?\nwith the responses (to be marked with a single (X)):\nAros yn aelod o'r Undeb Ewropeaidd\nGadael yr Undeb Ewropeaidd\nOriginally the Bill set out the question that was to appear on ballot papers as:\nShould the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?\nand in Welsh:\nA ddylai'r Deyrnas Unedig aros yn aelod o'r Undeb Ewropeaidd?\npermitting a simple YES/NO answer.\nThe original proposed question was similar to the question voters were asked in the original 1975 EC membership referendum. However, during subsequent research by the Electoral Commission in their assessment which was published in September 2015 found that \"members of the public feel the wording was not balanced and there was a perception of bias\" and proposed a change in the wording of the question. The proposed change was accepted by the government, shortly before the Bill's third reading.[15][16][17]\nUnder the provisions of the Act, the designation of a \"voting area\" (also known by some as \"Counting areas\") on the day of the referendum was to be overseen by \"Counting officers\" (CO) who were to declare the results of their local areas within the United Kingdom and Gibraltar as follows:\nThere were a total of 382 voting areas. 326 in England, 32 in Scotland, 22 in Wales and single areas for Northern Ireland and Gibraltar. The local counts in the voting areas began from 2200 BST (Western European Summer Time) on Thursday 23 June 2016 after all polling stations had closed. Recounts within \"voting areas\" were permitted when circumstances require under the instructions of the \"Counting officers (CO).\" It was the first time that a United Kingdom referendum was counted overnight as both the previous 1975 EC Referendum and the 2011 AV Referendum were counted during the course of the following day after polling stations closed.\nThe Act also provided provision for the results from the \"voting areas\" to fed into twelve \"regional counts\" to be overseen by \"Regional counting officers\" (RCO) who were appointed in the following areas and declared the results for their areas as used under the European Parliamentary Elections Act 2002:\nFor the purposes of the referendum, the local result from Gibraltar was fed into the South West England regional count. The regions each declared their results once all local voting areas had declared their local results early on Friday 24 June 2016. There was no provision under the Act for any national or regional recounts by the Chief Counting Officer and Regional Counting Officers.\nThe right to vote in the referendum applied to UK and Gibraltar residents who are British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens, in accordance with the provisions of the Representation of the People Act 1983 and the Representation of the People Act 2000. Members of the House of Lords were able to vote in the referendum. Citizens of other EU countries resident in the UK were not allowed to vote unless they were citizens of Ireland, Malta or Cyprus. The same Acts only permitted UK nationals who had lived overseas for less than 15 years to vote, thus excluding a large number of British Europeans who were directly concerned, from voting either. [18] This meant that a total of around 46.5 million people would be eligible to cast a vote in the referendum. Voting on the day of the referendum was from 07:00 to 22:00 BST (Western European Summer Time) (07:00 to 22:00 Central European Summer Time in Gibraltar) in some 41,000 polling stations staffed by over 100,000 officials. Each polling station was specified to have no more than 2,500 registered voters.[19] Also under the provisions of the Representation of the People Act 2000 postal ballots were also permitted in the referendum and were sent out to eligible voters some three weeks ahead of the vote (2 June 2016). Residents of the Isle of Man, and the other Crown Dependencies Jersey and Guernsey, were not be eligible to vote in the referendum, as those territories are not part of the UK [nor of the EU].[20]\nThe minimum age for voters in the referendum was 18 years, in accordance with Representation Acts (above). A House of Lords amendment proposing to lower the minimum age to 16 years[21] was rejected.[6]\nOn the morning of Saturday 20 February 2016 Prime Minister David Cameron held a special cabinet meeting in 10 Downing Street with his fellow Ministers (the first such meeting to be held on a Saturday since 3 April 1982 at the start of the Falklands War). After the meeting, he announced outside the door of No 10 that the referendum would be held on Thursday 23 June 2016. On Monday 22 February 2016, Parliament enacted secondary legislation to authorise the holding of the referendum on that date.[22]\nOn Tuesday 21 June 2016, the Electoral Commission announced the provisional official number of eligible voters who were entitled to vote in the referendum on Thursday 23 June in each of the constituent countries of the United Kingdom and Gibraltar following the closing date for registration on Thursday 9 June 2016 (these figures include all Commonwealth and Irish citizens along with members of the House of Lords who are not normally eligible to vote in UK general elections).[23] The final number of eligible voters was published after 9\u00a0pm on Thursday 23 June 2016 by the Electoral Commission.[24]\nThe following shows both the provisional figures and the final figures in heavy bold brackets.\nThe national result was declared by Chief counting officer (CCO) and the then chair of the Electoral Commission Jenny Watson at Manchester Town Hall on Friday 24 June 2016 at 07:20 BST after all 382 voting areas and the 12 regions of the United Kingdom had declared their results. Of the voting areas a total of 263 returned majority votes in favour of leaving the European Union whilst 119 returned majority votes in favour of continued European Union membership including every council area within Scotland on a national turnout of 72% and in the voting regions Scotland, Northern Ireland and Greater London voted to remain whilst all other regions including Wales voted to leave.\nThe Act made no provision for the result to be legally binding on the government or on any future government; legally it was merely advisory.[26] The result of the referendum required a single majority vote of the United Kingdom and Gibraltar with no super majorities, no double majorities of the constituent countries, nor any minimum turnout threshold required for the vote to pass. The Act did not specify any specific consequences that would follow the result of the referendum. In the event of a \"Leave\" vote, it was expected that the government would decide whether, when, and under what circumstances, the UK would invoke Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union to begin a two-year process of negotiations for Britain to leave the EU. Since the Act was also silent on the question of executive prerogative, the question of whether the government or Parliament was entitled to invoke Article 50 was the subject of court proceedings (Miller's case). James Eadie QC, acting for the government, submitted in his address to the court that, because the Act is silent, it would imply that Parliament chose not to limit prerogative powers in this matter.[27]\nOn 3 November 2016, the High Court in London ruled that it is the responsibility of Parliament (and not of the Government unilaterally) to decide whether, when, and how the UK should set aside legislation (in this case, the European Communities Act 1972 that makes the UK a member of the EU). The court held that the referendum was \"advisory for the lawmakers in Parliament\", enabling the electorate to influence Parliament in its policy decisions. In interpreting the intent of the Act, the court considered the precedents of previous UK referendums. As a consequence, the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill 2017 was introduced into Parliament to gain Parliament's consent for the invocation of Article 50. European Union law remains enforceable in the United Kingdom until or unless the European Communities Act 1972 is repealed.[19] In October 2016, Theresa May promised a \"Great Repeal Bill\", which would repeal the European Communities Act and restate in UK law all enactments previously in force under EU law. This bill was expected to be introduced in the May 2017 parliamentary session and enacted before or during the Article 50 negotiations. It would not come into force until the date of exit. It would smooth the transition by ensuring that all laws remain in force until specifically repealed.[28] This ultimately became the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.\nFollowing the referendum result and the verdict of the R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union case in January 2017 the UK Government led by Prime Minister Theresa May passed the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017 which legally allowed the UK to formally begin the process and formally notified the European Union of the United Kingdom's intention to leave both the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community by triggering Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union on Wednesday 29 March 2017.", "links":

It sets out amendments to the Scotland Act 1998, with the aim of devolving further powers to Scotland in accordance with the recommendations of the Calman Commission.[1] It received royal assent in 2012.\nThe Act gave extra powers to the Scottish Parliament,[2] most notably:\nThe proposed legislation was based on the final report of the Calman Commission, which was established by an opposition Labour Party motion in the Scottish Parliament in December 2007, against the wishes of the Scottish National Party minority government.\nProfessor Jim Gallagher, the civil servant who drafted the Bill, was appointed to advise the Scotland Bill Committee of the Scottish Parliament, convened by Wendy Alexander, whose parliamentary motion started the whole Calman process.[4]\nThe Bill was presented to the House of Commons by the Secretary of State for Scotland, Michael Moore, on St Andrew's Day (30 November), 2010, and received an unopposed second reading on 27 January 2012.\nThe UK government stated that it would not pass the bill unless it had obtained a legislative consent motion from the Scottish Parliament,[5] although the Parliament of the United Kingdom could have passed the Bill in any case.[6] The governing Scottish National Party indicated that it planned to block the bill.[7][8] However, after a deal was reached between the two governments on 21 March 2012,[9] the Scottish Parliament unanimously passed a legislative consent motion in respect of the Bill on 18 April 2012.[10]\nThe Secretary of State for Scotland, Michael Moore, described the legislation as the largest transfer of fiscal powers from central Government since the creation of the United Kingdom.[11]\nAlthough the Scottish National Party supported some parts of the Bill as introduced, it opposed others. In particular, it considered that the income tax proposals were flawed.[12] However, the SNP agreed to support the Bill, after the proposals to return certain powers were dropped,[13] and agreement was reached that the details of the income tax changes would be subject to approval by MSPs.[14] After the Bill received legislative consent from the Scottish Parliament, the Cabinet Secretary for Parliamentary Business and Government Strategy, Bruce Crawford, MSP argued that, although the Bill would not harm Scottish interests, it represented a missed opportunity and had been overtaken by events, in particular the return of an SNP majority government in 2011 and the consequent independence referendum.[15]\nThere is a proposal to amend section 57(2) of the Scotland Act 1998, which provides that the Lord Advocate, as a member of the Scottish Executive, has no power to do anything in contravention of the European Convention rights.  Given that, alongside being the adviser to and representative of the Scottish Government in Scots law, the Lord Advocate is head of the system of criminal prosecution in Scotland and every prosecution in a Scottish court proceeds with his/her authority, this provision effectively allows any human rights issue raised in any criminal proceedings in Scotland effectively to be appealed to the UK Supreme Court as a constitutional \"devolution issue\".[16]\nThe Supreme Court consists of two Supreme Court judges from Scotland and ten judges from other parts of the United Kingdom. When hearing appeals the Supreme Court sits with a bench of at least five judges, so even if both Scottish judges are present for a Scottish appeal, the majority of the bench will be judges who may not be especially well versed in Scots law and criminal procedure. According to Lord Hope of Craighead, the Deputy President of the Supreme Court, non-Scottish judges will in practice defer to their Scottish colleagues in Scottish cases, and often simply concur with judgments written by the Scottish judges.  However, the situation is seen by some, including the Scottish Government, as undermining the status of the High Court of Justiciary as the final court of appeal in criminal matters in Scots law, and even of undermining the integrity of Scots law.  The Advocate General for Scotland asked an expert group, chaired by Sir David Edward, to consider this issue and make recommendations, which led to the amendments to the Scotland Bill proposed by the UK Government.  The Scottish Government remains concerned that the amendments may not fully address the issue, particularly as a result of the decision of the Supreme Court in Fraser v HM Advocate, and appointed their own expert group, chaired by Lord McCluskey, to consider the matter and report back.", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland_Act_2012", "

News - scotland remains home to britain's tallest tree as dughall mor reaches new heights": {"text": "The Welsh Douglas Fir at Powys Castle was recently measured at a height of 62.5 metres, suggesting it had surpassed the height of the Highland tree, which was measured at 62 metres in 2003.  The discovery was made during filming of a new BBC series, \"Trees Which Made Britain\", which will be broadcast in Autumn 2006.\n\nThe BBC crew, working with staff from Kew Gardens, travelled north of the border to check the Welsh claim.  The crew, together with Jim Patterson of the Tree Register of the British Isles and Forestry Commission Scotland staff, remeasured Scotland's tallest tree using the latest laser technology.  Readings were taken from three locations and gave an average of a few centimetres over 64 metres, reconfirming the tall giant's status as Scotland's, and indeed Britain's, tallest tree.\n\nInverness Forest District Manager David Jardine said;\n\"I am delighted to hear that Dughall Mor, which means 'big dark stranger' in Gaelic, remains the tallest tree in Britain, if not in Europe.  This tree is one of a number of very fine trees at Reelig Glen, near Inverness, where around 25,000 visitors enjoy the tall trees walk every year.  We were glad to be able to contribute to the forthcoming BBC series, and hope that everybody will be able to get out and enjoy Britain's finest trees, whether they be in Scotland, Wales or England.\"\n\nNotes to Editors:\n\n1) For further information about Dughall Mor contact: David Jardine, Inverness Forest District Manager, tel: 01463 791575, email: david.jardine@forestry.gsi.gov.uk, or visit www.forestry.gov.uk/scotland\n\n2) Attached photograph pictures David Jardine (Inverness Forest District Manager) alongside Tony Kirkham and Jon Hammerton (both Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew) and Jim Paterson (Tree Register of British Isles).

In order to qualify for the list a structure must:\nThis consciously excludes ruins of limited height, roads and statues. Bridges may be included if they otherwise fulfill the above criteria. Dates for many of the oldest structures have been arrived at by radiocarbon dating and should be considered approximate.\nThe main chronological list includes buildings that date from no later than 1199 AD. Although the oldest building on the list is the Neolithic farmhouse at Knap of Howar, the earliest period is dominated by chambered cairns, numerous examples of which can be found from the 4th millennium BC through to the early Bronze Age.\nEstimates of the number of broch sites throughout the country, which date from the Iron Age, range from just over 100 to over 500.[2] However, only a small percentage are sufficiently well preserved for them to be included here and some of those that could be remain undated.\nAs there are  relatively few structures from the latter half of the first millennium AD and a significant number from the 12th century, the latter group is  placed in a sub-list. There are larger numbers of extant qualifying structures from 1200 onwards and separate lists for 13th-century castles and religious buildings are provided. As the oldest buildings in many of the council areas in the more urbanised Central Belt date from after the 14th century, a separate list showing oldest buildings by council area is provided.\nThere is also a supplementary list of qualifying structures for which no confirmed date of construction is available and a short listing of substantial prehistoric structures that are not buildings as defined above.\nThe following are amongst the oldest buildings in each council area of Scotland.\nThe following are very old buildings that meet the qualifying criteria but for which no reliable date of construction has emerged.\nThe following are very old human constructions that do not fit the above criteria for a building.", "links":

which  runs for 96\u00a0miles (154\u00a0km) between Marshall Meadows Bay on the east coast and the Solway Firth in the west.\nThe Firth of Forth was the border between the Picto-Gaelic Kingdom of Alba and the Anglian Kingdom of Northumbria in the early 10th century. It became the first Anglo-Scottish border with the annexation of Northumbria by Anglo-Saxon England in the mid-10th century. In 973, Kenneth, King of Scots attended the English king, Edgar the Peaceful, at his council in Chester. After Kenneth had reportedly done homage, Edgar rewarded Kenneth by granting him Lothian.[1] Despite this transaction, the control of Lothian was not finally settled and the region was taken by the Scots at the Battle of Carham in 1018 and the River Tweed became the de facto Anglo-Scottish border. The Solway\u2013Tweed line was legally established in 1237 by the Treaty of York between England and Scotland.[2] It remains the border today, with the exception of the Debatable Lands, north of Carlisle, and a small area around Berwick-upon-Tweed, which was taken by England in 1482. Berwick was not fully annexed into England until 1746, by the Wales and Berwick Act 1746.[3]\nFor centuries until the Union of the Crowns the region on either side of the boundary was a lawless territory suffering from the repeated raids in each direction of the Border Reivers. Following the Treaty of Union 1706, ratified by the Acts of Union 1707, which united Scotland with England and Wales to form the Kingdom of Great Britain, the Border forms the boundary of the two legal systems as the treaty between Scotland and England guaranteed the continued separation of English law and Scots law.[4] The age of marriage under Scots law is 16, while it is 18 under English law. The border settlements of Gretna Green to the west, and Coldstream and Lamberton to the east, were convenient for elopers from England who wanted to marry under Scottish laws, and marry without publicity.\nThe marine boundary was adjusted by the Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundaries Order 1999 so that the boundary within the territorial waters (up to the 12-mile (19\u00a0km) limit) is 90 metres (300\u00a0ft) north of the boundary for oil installations established by the Civil Jurisdiction (Offshore Activities) Order 1987.[5] The land border is near and roughly parallel to the 420 million-year-old Iapetus Suture.\nThe border country, historically known as the Scottish Marches, is the area on either side of the Anglo-Scottish border including parts of the modern council areas of Dumfries and Galloway and the Scottish Borders, and parts of the English counties of Cumbria and Northumberland. It is a hilly area, with the Scottish Southern Uplands to the north, and the Cheviot Hills forming the border between the two countries to the south. From the Norman conquest of England until the reign of James VI of Scotland, who in the course of his reign became James I of England while retaining the more northerly realm, border clashes were common and the monarchs of both countries relied on Scottish Earls of March and Lord Warden of the Marches to defend and control the frontier region.\nIn 1333, during the Second War of Scottish Independence, Scotland was defeated at the Battle of Halidon Hill and Edward III occupied much of the borderlands.  Edward declared Edward Balliol the new King of Scots, in exchange for much of southern Scotland and absolute supplication, but this was not recognised by the majority of the Scottish nobility who remained loyal to David II and conflict continued.[6] By 1341, Perth and Edinburgh had been retaken by the Scots and Edward Balliol fled to England, effectively nullifying the supposed treaty. Edward would continue the war but would be unable to restore the puppet ruler Balliol to the throne and with the Treaty of Berwick (1357) Scottish independence was once again acknowledged with any pretence to territorial annexations dropped.\nA 16th-century Act of the Scottish Parliament talks about the chiefs of the border clans, and a late 17th-century statement by the Lord Advocate uses the terms \"clan\" and \"family\" interchangeably. Although Lowland aristocrats may have increasingly liked to refer to themselves as \"families\", the idea that the term \"clan\" should be used for Highland families alone is a 19th-century convention.[7]\nHistoric Border clans include the following: Armstrong, Beattie, Bannatyne, Bell, Briar, Carruthers, Douglas, Elliot, Graham, Hedley of Redesdale, Henderson, Hall, Home or Hume, Irvine, Jardine, Johnstone, Kerr, Little, Moffat, Nesbitt, Ogilvy, Porteous, Robson, Routledge, Scott, Thompson, Tweedie.\nDuring late medieval and early modern eras\u2014from the late 13th century, with the creation by Edward I of England of the first Lord Warden of the Marches to the early 17th century and the creation of the Middle Shires, promulgated after the personal union of England and Scotland under James VI of Scotland (James I of England)\u2014the area around the border was known as the Scottish Marches.\nFor centuries the Marches on either side of the boundary was an area of mixed allegiances, where families or clans switched which country or side they supported as suited their family interests at that time, and lawlessness abounded. Before the personal union of the two kingdoms under James, the border clans would switch allegiance between the Scottish and English crowns depending on what was most favourable for the members of the clan. For a time a powerful local clan dominated a region on the border between England and Scotland. It was known as the Debatable Lands and neither monarch's writ was heeded.[citation needed]\nFollowing the 1603 Union of the Crowns, King James VI & I decreed that the Borders should be renamed 'the Middle Shires'. In the same year the King placed George Home, 1st Earl of Dunbar in charge of the pacification of the borders. Courts were set up in the towns of the Middle Shires and known reivers were arrested. The more troublesome and lower classes were executed without trial; known as \"Jeddart justice\" (after the town of Jedburgh in Roxburghshire). Mass hanging soon became a common occurrence. In 1605 he established a joint commission of ten members, drawn equally from Scotland and England, to bring law and order to the region. This was aided by statutes in 1606 and 1609, first to repeal hostile laws on both sides of the border, and then to more easily prosecute cross-border raiders.[8] Reivers could no longer escape justice by crossing from England to Scotland or vice versa.[9] The rough-and-ready Border Laws were abolished and the folk of the middle shires found they had to obey the law of the land like all other subjects.\nIn 1607 James felt he could boast that \"the Middle Shires\" had \"become the navel or umbilic of both kingdoms, planted and peopled with civility and riches\".  After ten years King James had succeeded; the Middle Shires had been brought under central law and order. By the early 1620s the Borders were so peaceful that the Crown was able to scale down its operations.\nDespite these improvements, the Joint Commission continued its work, and as late as 25 September 1641 under King Charles I, Sir Richard Graham, a local laird and English MP, was petitioning the Parliament of Scotland \"for regulating the disorders in the borders\".[10] Conditions along the border generally deteriorated during the Commonwealth and Protectorate periods, with the development of Moss-trooper raiders. Following the Restoration, ongoing border lawlessness was dealt with by reviving former legislation, renewed continually in eleven subsequent acts, for periods ranging from five to eleven years, up until the late 1750s.[8]\nThe Debatable Lands lay between Scotland and England to the north of Carlisle,[11] the largest population centre being Canonbie.[12] For over three hundred years the area was effectively controlled by local clans, such as the Armstrongs, who successfully resisted any attempt by the Scottish or English governments to impose their authority.[13] In 1552 commissioners met to divide the land in two: Douglas of Drumlanrigg leading the Scots; Lord Wharton leading the English; the French ambassador acting as umpire. The Scots' Dike was built as the new frontier, with stones set up bearing the arms of England and of Scotland.[14][15]\nBerwick is famous for its hesitation over whether it is part of Scotland or England.[16] Berwickshire is in Scotland while the town is in England, although both Berwick and the lands up to the Firth of Forth belonged to the Kingdom of Northumbria in the Early Middle Ages.[17] The town changed hands more than a dozen times before being finally taken by the English in 1482, though confusion continued for centuries.  The Wales and Berwick Act 1746 clarified the status of Berwick as an English town. In the 1950s the artist Wendy Wood moved the border signs south to the middle of the River Tweed as a protest.[18] In 2008 SNP MSP Christine Grahame made calls in the Scottish Parliament for Berwick to become part of Scotland again.[19] Berwick's MP Anne-Marie Trevelyan has resisted any change, arguing that: \"Voters in Berwick-upon-Tweed do not believe it is whether they are in England or Scotland that is important.\"[20]\nAt the River Tweed the border runs down the middle of the river, however between the villages of Wark and Cornhill the Scottish border comes south of the river to enclose a small riverside meadow of approximately 2 to 3 acres (about a hectare). This piece of land is known as the Ba Green. It is said locally that every year the men of Coldstream (to the North of the river) would play mob football with the men of Wark (to the South of the river) at Ba, and the winning side would claim the Ba Green for their country. As Coldstream grew to have a larger population than Wark, the Coldstream men always defeated the Wark men at the game, and so the land became a permanent part of Scotland.[21][22][23]\nIt is a common misconception that Hadrian's Wall marks the Anglo-Scottish border.  The wall lies entirely within England and has never formed this boundary.[24][25] While in the west, at Bowness-on-Solway, it is less than 0.6\u00a0mi (1.0\u00a0km) south of the border with Scotland, in the east it is as much as 68 miles (109\u00a0km) away.\nFor centuries the wall was the boundary between the Roman province of Britannia (to the south) and the Celtic lands of Caledonia (to the north). However Britannia occasionally extended as far north as the later Antonine Wall.  Furthermore, to speak of England and Scotland at any time prior to the ninth century is anachronistic; such nations had no meaningful existence during the period of Roman rule.\n\"Hadrian's Wall\" is nonetheless often used as an informal reference to the modern border, often semi-humorously.[a]\nCumbria and Northumberland have amongst the largest Scottish-born communities in the world outside Scotland. 16,628 Scottish-born people were residing in Cumbria in 2001 (3.41% of the county's population) and 11,435 Scottish-born people were residing in Northumberland (3.72% of the county's population); the overall percentage of Scottish-born people in England is 1.62%.[26]\nConsequently, almost 9% of Scotland's population is English-born (459,486), with higher than average percentages of English-born people in both Dumfries & Galloway and the Scottish Borders council areas, respectively, reaching as high as 35% or higher English-born.[27]\nMedia related to Border of
