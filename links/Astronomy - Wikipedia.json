{"Astronomy - Wikipedia": {"text": "Astronomy (from Ancient Greek  \u1f00\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03af\u03b1 (astronom\u00eda)\u00a0'science that studies the laws of the stars') is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It uses mathematics, physics, and chemistry in order to explain their origin and evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, nebulae, galaxies, and comets. Relevant phenomena include supernova explosions, gamma ray bursts, quasars, blazars, pulsars, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, astronomy studies everything that originates beyond Earth's atmosphere. Cosmology is a branch of astronomy that studies the universe as a whole.[1]\nAstronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences. The early civilizations in recorded history made methodical observations of the night sky. These include the Babylonians, Greeks, Indians, Egyptians, Chinese, Maya, and many ancient indigenous peoples of the Americas. In the past, astronomy included disciplines as diverse as astrometry, celestial navigation, observational astronomy, and the making of calendars. Nowadays, professional astronomy is often said to be the same as astrophysics.[2]\nProfessional astronomy is split into observational and theoretical branches. Observational astronomy is focused on acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects. This data is then analyzed using basic principles of physics. Theoretical astronomy is oriented toward the development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena. These two fields complement each other. Theoretical astronomy seeks to explain observational results and observations are used to confirm theoretical results.\nAstronomy is one of the few sciences in which amateurs play an active role. This is especially true for the discovery and observation of transient events. Amateur astronomers have helped with many important discoveries, such as finding new comets.\nAstronomy (from the Greek \u1f00\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03af\u03b1 from \u1f04\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd astron, \"star\" and -\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03af\u03b1 -nomia from \u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 nomos, \"law\" or \"culture\") means \"law of the stars\" (or \"culture of the stars\" depending on the translation). Astronomy should not be confused with astrology, the belief system which claims that human affairs are correlated with the positions of celestial objects.[4] Although the two fields share a common origin, they are now entirely distinct.[5]\n\"Astronomy\" and \"astrophysics\" are synonyms.[6][7][8] Based on strict dictionary definitions, \"astronomy\" refers to \"the study of objects and matter outside the Earth's atmosphere and of their physical and chemical properties,\"[9] while \"astrophysics\" refers to the branch of astronomy dealing with \"the behavior, physical properties, and dynamic processes of celestial objects and phenomena\".[10] In some cases, as in the introduction of the introductory textbook The Physical Universe by Frank Shu, \"astronomy\" may be used to describe the qualitative study of the subject, whereas \"astrophysics\" is used to describe the physics-oriented version of the subject.[11] However, since most modern astronomical research deals with subjects related to physics, modern astronomy could actually be called astrophysics.[6] Some fields, such as astrometry, are purely astronomy rather than also astrophysics. Various departments in which scientists carry out research on this subject may use \"astronomy\" and \"astrophysics\", partly depending on whether the department is historically affiliated with a physics department,[7] and many professional astronomers have physics rather than astronomy degrees.[8] Some titles of the leading scientific journals in this field include The Astronomical Journal, The Astrophysical Journal, and Astronomy & Astrophysics.\nIn early historic times, astronomy only consisted of the observation and predictions of the motions of objects visible to the naked eye. In some locations, early cultures assembled massive artifacts that may have had some astronomical purpose. In addition to their ceremonial uses, these observatories could be employed to determine the seasons, an important factor in knowing when to plant crops and in understanding the length of the year.[12]\nBefore tools such as the telescope were invented, early study of the stars was conducted using the naked eye. As civilizations developed, most notably in Mesopotamia, Greece, Persia, India, China, Egypt, and Central America, astronomical observatories were assembled and ideas on the nature of the Universe began to develop. Most early astronomy consisted of mapping the positions of the stars and planets, a science now referred to as astrometry. From these observations, early ideas about the motions of the planets were formed, and the nature of the Sun, Moon and the Earth in the Universe were explored philosophically. The Earth was believed to be the center of the Universe with the Sun, the Moon and the stars rotating around it. This is known as the geocentric model of the Universe, or the Ptolemaic system, named after Ptolemy.[13]\nA particularly important early development was the beginning of mathematical and scientific astronomy, which began among the Babylonians, who laid the foundations for the later astronomical traditions that developed in many other civilizations.[15] The Babylonians discovered that lunar eclipses recurred in a repeating cycle known as a saros.[16]\nFollowing the Babylonians, significant advances in astronomy were made in ancient Greece and the Hellenistic world. Greek astronomy is characterized from the start by seeking a rational, physical explanation for celestial phenomena.[17] In the 3rd century BC, Aristarchus of Samos estimated the size and distance of the Moon and Sun, and he proposed a model of the Solar System where the Earth and planets rotated around the Sun, now called the heliocentric model.[18] In the 2nd century BC, Hipparchus discovered precession, calculated the size and distance of the Moon and invented the earliest known astronomical devices such as the astrolabe.[19] Hipparchus also created a comprehensive catalog of 1020 stars, and most of the constellations of the northern hemisphere derive from Greek astronomy.[20] The Antikythera mechanism (c.\u2009150\u201380 BC) was an early analog computer designed to calculate the location of the Sun, Moon, and planets for a given date. Technological artifacts of similar complexity did not reappear until the 14th century, when mechanical astronomical clocks appeared in Europe.[21]\nMedieval Europe housed a number of important astronomers. Richard of Wallingford (1292\u20131336) made major contributions to astronomy and horology, including the invention of the first astronomical clock, the Rectangulus which allowed for the measurement of angles between planets and other astronomical bodies, as well as an equatorium called the Albion which could be used for astronomical calculations such as lunar, solar and planetary longitudes and could predict eclipses. Nicole Oresme (1320\u20131382) and Jean Buridan (1300\u20131361) first discussed evidence for the rotation of the Earth, furthermore, Buridan also developed the theory of impetus (predecessor of the modern scientific theory of inertia) which was able to show planets were capable of motion without the intervention of angels.[22] Georg von Peuerbach (1423\u20131461) and Regiomontanus (1436\u20131476) helped make astronomical progress instrumental to Copernicus's development of the heliocentric model decades later.\nAstronomy flourished in the Islamic world and other parts of the world. This led to the emergence of the first astronomical observatories in the Muslim world by the early 9th century.[23][24][25] In 964, the Andromeda Galaxy, the largest galaxy in the Local Group, was described by the Persian Muslim astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi in his Book of Fixed Stars.[26] The SN 1006 supernova, the brightest apparent magnitude stellar event in recorded history, was observed by the Egyptian Arabic astronomer Ali ibn Ridwan and Chinese astronomers in 1006. Some of the prominent Islamic (mostly Persian and Arab) astronomers who made significant contributions to the science include Al-Battani, Thebit, Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi, Biruni, Ab\u016b Ish\u0101q Ibr\u0101h\u012bm al-Zarq\u0101l\u012b, Al-Birjandi, and the astronomers of the Maragheh and Samarkand observatories. Astronomers during that time introduced many Arabic names now used for individual stars.[27][28]\nIt is also believed that the ruins at Great Zimbabwe and Timbuktu[29] may have housed astronomical observatories.[30] In Post-classical West Africa, Astronomers studied the movement of stars and relation to seasons, crafting charts of the heavens as well as precise diagrams of orbits of the other planets based on complex mathematical calculations. Songhai historian Mahmud Kati documented a meteor shower in August 1583.[31][32]\nEuropeans had previously believed that there had been no astronomical observation in sub-Saharan Africa during the pre-colonial Middle Ages, but modern discoveries show otherwise.[33][34][35][36]\nFor over six centuries (from the recovery of ancient learning during the late Middle Ages into the Enlightenment), the Roman Catholic Church gave more financial and social support to the study of astronomy than probably all other institutions. Among the Church's motives was finding the date for Easter.[37]\nDuring the Renaissance, Nicolaus Copernicus proposed a heliocentric model of the solar system. His work was defended by Galileo Galilei and expanded upon by Johannes Kepler. Kepler was the first to devise a system that correctly described the details of the motion of the planets around the Sun. However, Kepler did not succeed in formulating a theory behind the laws he wrote down.[38] It was Isaac Newton, with his invention of celestial dynamics and his law of gravitation, who finally explained the motions of the planets. Newton also developed the reflecting telescope.[39]\nImprovements in the size and quality of the telescope led to further discoveries. The English astronomer John Flamsteed catalogued over 3000 stars,[40] More extensive star catalogues were produced by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille. The astronomer William Herschel made a detailed catalog of nebulosity and clusters, and in 1781 discovered the planet Uranus, the first new planet found.[41]\nDuring the 18\u201319th centuries, the study of the three-body problem by Leonhard Euler, Alexis Claude Clairaut, and Jean le Rond d'Alembert led to more accurate predictions about the motions of the Moon and planets. This work was further refined by Joseph-Louis Lagrange and Pierre Simon Laplace, allowing the masses of the planets and moons to be estimated from their perturbations.[42]\nSignificant advances in astronomy came about with the introduction of new technology, including the spectroscope and photography. Joseph von Fraunhofer discovered about 600 bands in the spectrum of the Sun in 1814\u201315, which, in 1859, Gustav Kirchhoff ascribed to the presence of different elements. Stars were proven to be similar to the Earth's own Sun, but with a wide range of temperatures, masses, and sizes.[27]\nThe existence of the Earth's galaxy, the Milky Way, as its own group of stars was only proved in the 20th century, along with the existence of \"external\" galaxies. The observed recession of those galaxies led to the discovery of the expansion of the Universe.[43] Theoretical astronomy led to speculations on the existence of objects such as black holes and neutron stars, which have been used to explain such observed phenomena as quasars, pulsars, blazars, and radio galaxies. Physical cosmology made huge advances during the 20th century. In the early 1900s the model of the Big Bang theory was formulated, heavily evidenced by cosmic microwave background radiation, Hubble's law, and the cosmological abundances of elements. Space telescopes have enabled measurements in parts of the electromagnetic spectrum normally blocked or blurred by the atmosphere.[44] In February 2016, it was revealed that the LIGO project had detected evidence of gravitational waves in the previous September.[45][46]\nThe main source of information about celestial bodies and other objects is visible light, or more generally electromagnetic radiation.[47] Observational astronomy may be categorized according to the corresponding region of the electromagnetic spectrum on which the observations are made. Some parts of the spectrum can be observed from the Earth's surface, while other parts are only observable from either high altitudes or outside the Earth's atmosphere. Specific information on these subfields is given below.\nRadio astronomy uses radiation with wavelengths greater than approximately one millimeter, outside the visible range.[48] Radio astronomy is different from most other forms of observational astronomy in that the observed radio waves can be treated as waves rather than as discrete photons. Hence, it is relatively easier to measure both the amplitude and phase of radio waves, whereas this is not as easily done at shorter wavelengths.[48]\nAlthough some radio waves are emitted directly by astronomical objects, a product of thermal emission, most of the radio emission that is observed is the result of synchrotron radiation, which is produced when electrons orbit magnetic fields.[48] Additionally, a number of spectral lines produced by interstellar gas, notably the hydrogen spectral line at 21\u00a0cm, are observable at radio wavelengths.[11][48]\nA wide variety of other objects are observable at radio wavelengths, including supernovae, interstellar gas, pulsars, and active galactic nuclei.[11][48]\nInfrared astronomy is founded on the detection and analysis of infrared radiation, wavelengths longer than red light and outside the range of our vision. The infrared spectrum is useful for studying objects that are too cold to radiate visible light, such as planets, circumstellar disks or nebulae whose light is blocked by dust. The longer wavelengths of infrared can penetrate clouds of dust that block visible light, allowing the observation of young stars embedded in molecular clouds and the cores of galaxies. Observations from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) have been particularly effective at unveiling numerous galactic protostars and their host star clusters.[50][51]\nWith the exception of infrared wavelengths close to visible light, such radiation is heavily absorbed by the atmosphere, or masked, as the atmosphere itself produces significant infrared emission. Consequently, infrared observatories have to be located in high, dry places on Earth or in space.[52] Some molecules radiate strongly in the infrared. This allows the study of the chemistry of space; more specifically it can detect water in comets.[53]\nHistorically, optical astronomy, also called visible light astronomy, is the oldest form of astronomy.[54] Images of observations were originally drawn by hand. In the late 19th century and most of the 20th century, images were made using photographic equipment. Modern images are made using digital detectors, particularly using charge-coupled devices (CCDs) and recorded on modern medium. Although visible light itself extends from approximately 4000 \u00c5 to 7000 \u00c5 (400 nm to 700\u00a0nm),[54] that same equipment can be used to observe some near-ultraviolet and near-infrared radiation.\nUltraviolet astronomy employs ultraviolet wavelengths between approximately 100 and 3200\u00a0\u00c5 (10 to 320\u00a0nm).[48] Light at those wavelengths is absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, requiring observations at these wavelengths to be performed from the upper atmosphere or from space. Ultraviolet astronomy is best suited to the study of thermal radiation and spectral emission lines from hot blue stars (OB stars) that are very bright in this wave band. This includes the blue stars in other galaxies, which have been the targets of several ultraviolet surveys. Other objects commonly observed in ultraviolet light include planetary nebulae, supernova remnants, and active galactic nuclei.[48] However, as ultraviolet light is easily absorbed by interstellar dust, an adjustment of ultraviolet measurements is necessary.[48]\nX-ray astronomy uses X-ray wavelengths. Typically, X-ray radiation is produced by synchrotron emission (the result of electrons orbiting magnetic field lines), thermal emission from thin gases above 107 (10\u00a0million) kelvins, and thermal emission from thick gases above 107 Kelvin.[48] Since X-rays are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, all X-ray observations must be performed from high-altitude balloons, rockets, or X-ray astronomy satellites. Notable X-ray sources include X-ray binaries, pulsars, supernova remnants, elliptical galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and active galactic nuclei.[48]\nGamma ray astronomy observes astronomical objects at the shortest wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. Gamma rays may be observed directly by satellites such as the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory or by specialized telescopes called atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes.[48] The Cherenkov telescopes do not detect the gamma rays directly but instead detect the flashes of visible light produced when gamma rays are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere.[55]\nMost gamma-ray emitting sources are actually gamma-ray bursts, objects which only produce gamma radiation for a few milliseconds to thousands of seconds before fading away. Only 10% of gamma-ray sources are non-transient sources. These steady gamma-ray emitters include pulsars, neutron stars, and black hole candidates such as active galactic nuclei.[48]\nIn addition to electromagnetic radiation, a few other events originating from great distances may be observed from the Earth.\nIn neutrino astronomy, astronomers use heavily shielded underground facilities such as SAGE, GALLEX, and Kamioka II/III for the detection of neutrinos. The vast majority of the neutrinos streaming through the Earth originate from the Sun, but 24 neutrinos were also detected from supernova 1987A.[48] Cosmic rays, which consist of very high energy particles (atomic nuclei) that can decay or be absorbed when they enter the Earth's atmosphere, result in a cascade of secondary particles which can be detected by current observatories.[56] Some future neutrino detectors may also be sensitive to the particles produced when cosmic rays hit the Earth's atmosphere.[48]\nGravitational-wave astronomy is an emerging field of astronomy that employs gravitational-wave detectors to collect observational data about distant massive objects. A few observatories have been constructed, such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Observatory LIGO. LIGO made its first detection on 14 September 2015, observing gravitational waves from a binary black hole.[57] A second gravitational wave was detected on 26 December 2015 and additional observations should continue but gravitational waves require extremely sensitive instruments.[58][59]\nThe combination of observations made using electromagnetic radiation, neutrinos or gravitational waves and other complementary information, is known as multi-messenger astronomy.[60][61]\nOne of the oldest fields in astronomy, and in all of science, is the measurement of the positions of celestial objects. Historically, accurate knowledge of the positions of the Sun, Moon, planets and stars has been essential in celestial navigation (the use of celestial objects to guide navigation) and in the making of calendars.[62]:\u200a39\nCareful measurement of the positions of the planets has led to a solid understanding of gravitational perturbations, and an ability to determine past and future positions of the planets with great accuracy, a field known as celestial mechanics. More recently the tracking of near-Earth objects will allow for predictions of close encounters or potential collisions of the Earth with those objects.[63]\nThe measurement of stellar parallax of nearby stars provides a fundamental baseline in the cosmic distance ladder that is used to measure the scale of the Universe. Parallax measurements of nearby stars provide an absolute baseline for the properties of more distant stars, as their properties can be compared. Measurements of the radial velocity and proper motion of stars allow astronomers to plot the movement of these systems through the Milky Way galaxy. Astrometric results are the basis used to calculate the distribution of speculated dark matter in the galaxy.[64]\nDuring the 1990s, the measurement of the stellar wobble of nearby stars was used to detect large extrasolar planets orbiting those stars.[65]\nTheoretical astronomers use several tools including analytical models and computational numerical simulations; each has its particular advantages. Analytical models of a process are better for giving broader insight into the heart of what is going on. Numerical models reveal the existence of phenomena and effects otherwise unobserved.[66][67]\nTheorists in astronomy endeavor to create theoretical models and from the results predict observational consequences of those models. The observation of a phenomenon predicted by a model allows astronomers to select between several alternate or conflicting models as the one best able to describe the phenomena.[citation needed]\nTheorists also try to generate or modify models to take into account new data. In the case of an inconsistency between the data and the model's results, the general tendency is to try to make minimal modifications to the model so that it produces results that fit the data. In some cases, a large amount of inconsistent data over time may lead to the total abandonment of a model.[citation needed]\nPhenomena modeled by theoretical astronomers include: stellar dynamics and evolution; galaxy formation; large-scale distribution of matter in the Universe; origin of cosmic rays; general relativity and physical cosmology, including string cosmology and astroparticle physics. Astrophysical relativity serves as a tool to gauge the properties of large scale structures for which gravitation plays a significant role in physical phenomena investigated and as the basis for black hole (astro)physics and the study of gravitational waves.[citation needed]\nSome widely accepted and studied theories and models in astronomy, now included in the Lambda-CDM model are the Big Bang, dark matter and fundamental theories of physics.\nAstrophysics is the branch of astronomy that employs the principles of physics and chemistry \"to ascertain the nature of the astronomical objects, rather than their positions or motions in space\".[68][69] Among the objects studied are the Sun, other stars, galaxies, extrasolar planets, the interstellar medium and the cosmic microwave background.[70][71] Their emissions are examined across all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, and the properties examined include luminosity, density, temperature, and chemical composition. Because astrophysics is a very broad subject, astrophysicists typically apply many disciplines of physics, including mechanics, electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, relativity, nuclear and particle physics, and atomic and molecular physics.\nIn practice, modern astronomical research often involves a substantial amount of work in the realms of theoretical and observational physics. Some areas of study for astrophysicists include their attempts to determine the properties of dark matter, dark energy, and black holes; whether or not time travel is possible, wormholes can form, or the multiverse exists; and the origin and ultimate fate of the universe.[70] Topics also studied by theoretical astrophysicists include Solar System formation and evolution; stellar dynamics and evolution; galaxy formation and evolution; magnetohydrodynamics; large-scale structure of matter in the universe; origin of cosmic rays; general relativity and physical cosmology, including string cosmology and astroparticle physics.\nAstrochemistry is the study of the abundance and reactions of molecules in the Universe, and their interaction with radiation.[72] The discipline is an overlap of astronomy and chemistry. The word \"astrochemistry\" may be applied to both the Solar System and the interstellar medium. The study of the abundance of elements and isotope ratios in Solar System objects, such as meteorites, is also called cosmochemistry, while the study of interstellar atoms and molecules and their interaction with radiation is sometimes called molecular astrophysics. The formation, atomic and chemical composition, evolution and fate of molecular gas clouds is of special interest, because it is from these clouds that solar systems form.\nStudies in this field contribute to the understanding of the formation of the Solar System, Earth's origin and geology, abiogenesis, and the origin of climate and oceans.\nAstrobiology is an interdisciplinary scientific field concerned with the origins, early evolution, distribution, and future of life in the universe. Astrobiology considers the question of whether extraterrestrial life exists, and how humans can detect it if it does.[73] The term exobiology is similar.[74]\nAstrobiology makes use of molecular biology, biophysics, biochemistry, chemistry, astronomy, physical cosmology, exoplanetology and geology to investigate the possibility of life on other worlds and help recognize biospheres that might be different from that on Earth.[75] The origin and early evolution of life is an inseparable part of the discipline of astrobiology.[76] Astrobiology concerns itself with interpretation of existing scientific data, and although speculation is entertained to give context, astrobiology concerns itself primarily with hypotheses that fit firmly into existing scientific theories.\nThis interdisciplinary field encompasses research on the origin of planetary systems, origins of organic compounds in space, rock-water-carbon interactions, abiogenesis on Earth, planetary habitability, research on biosignatures for life detection, and studies on the potential for life to adapt to challenges on Earth and in outer space.[77][78][79]\nCosmology (from the Greek \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 (kosmos) \"world, universe\" and \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 (logos) \"word, study\" or literally \"logic\") could be considered the study of the Universe as a whole.\nObservations of the large-scale structure of the Universe, a branch known as physical cosmology, have provided a deep understanding of the formation and evolution of the cosmos. Fundamental to modern cosmology is the well-accepted theory of the Big Bang, wherein our Universe began at a single point in time, and thereafter expanded over the course of 13.8 billion years[80] to its present condition.[81] The concept of the Big Bang can be traced back to the discovery of the microwave background radiation in 1965.[81]\nIn the course of this expansion, the Universe underwent several evolutionary stages. In the very early moments, it is theorized that the Universe experienced a very rapid cosmic inflation, which homogenized the starting conditions. Thereafter, nucleosynthesis produced the elemental abundance of the early Universe.[81] (See also nucleocosmochronology.)\nWhen the first neutral atoms formed from a sea of primordial ions, space became transparent to radiation, releasing the energy viewed today as the microwave background radiation. The expanding Universe then underwent a Dark Age due to the lack of stellar energy sources.[82]\nA hierarchical structure of matter began to form from minute variations in the mass density of space. Matter accumulated in the densest regions, forming clouds of gas and the earliest stars, the Population III stars. These massive stars triggered the reionization process and are believed to have created many of the heavy elements in the early Universe, which, through nuclear decay, create lighter elements, allowing the cycle of nucleosynthesis to continue longer.[83]\nGravitational aggregations clustered into filaments, leaving voids in the gaps. Gradually, organizations of gas and dust merged to form the first primitive galaxies. Over time, these pulled in more matter, and were often organized into groups and clusters of galaxies, then into larger-scale superclusters.[84]\nVarious fields of physics are crucial to studying the universe. Interdisciplinary studies involve the fields of quantum mechanics, particle physics, plasma physics, condensed matter physics, statistical mechanics, optics, and nuclear physics.[citation needed]\nFundamental to the structure of the Universe is the existence of dark matter and dark energy. These are now thought to be its dominant components, forming 96% of the mass of the Universe. For this reason, much effort is expended in trying to understand the physics of these components.[85]\nThe study of objects outside our galaxy is a branch of astronomy concerned with the formation and evolution of galaxies, their morphology (description) and classification, the observation of active galaxies, and at a larger scale, the groups and clusters of galaxies. Finally, the latter is important for the understanding of the large-scale structure of the cosmos.[62]\nMost galaxies are organized into distinct shapes that allow for classification schemes. They are commonly divided into spiral, elliptical and Irregular galaxies.[86]\nAs the name suggests, an elliptical galaxy has the cross-sectional shape of an ellipse. The stars move along random orbits with no preferred direction. These galaxies contain little or no interstellar dust, few star-forming regions, and older stars.[62]:\u200a877\u2013878\u200a Elliptical galaxies may have been formed by other galaxies merging together.[62]:\u200a939\nA spiral galaxy is organized into a flat, rotating disk, usually with a prominent bulge or bar at the center, and trailing bright arms that spiral outward. The arms are dusty regions of star formation within which massive young stars produce a blue tint. Spiral galaxies are typically surrounded by a halo of older stars. Both the Milky Way and one of our nearest galaxy neighbors, the Andromeda Galaxy, are spiral galaxies.[62]:\u200a875\nIrregular galaxies are chaotic in appearance, and are neither spiral nor elliptical.[62]:\u200a879\u200a About a quarter of all galaxies are irregular, and the peculiar shapes of such galaxies may be the result of gravitational interaction.[87]\nAn active galaxy is a formation that emits a significant amount of its energy from a source other than its stars, dust and gas. It is powered by a compact region at the core, thought to be a supermassive black hole that is emitting radiation from in-falling material.[62]:\u200a907\u200a A radio galaxy is an active galaxy that is very luminous in the radio portion of the spectrum, and is emitting immense plumes or lobes of gas. Active galaxies that emit shorter frequency, high-energy radiation include Seyfert galaxies, quasars, and blazars. Quasars are believed to be the most consistently luminous objects in the known universe.[88]\nThe large-scale structure of the cosmos is represented by groups and clusters of galaxies. This structure is organized into a hierarchy of groupings, with the largest being the superclusters. The collective matter is formed into filaments and walls, leaving large voids between.[89]\nThe Solar System orbits within the Milky Way, a barred spiral galaxy that is a prominent member of the Local Group of galaxies. It is a rotating mass of gas, dust, stars and other objects, held together by mutual gravitational attraction. As the Earth is located within the dusty outer arms, there are large portions of the Milky Way that are obscured from view.[62]:\u200a837\u2013842,\u200a944\nIn the center of the Milky Way is the core, a bar-shaped bulge with what is believed to be a supermassive black hole at its center. This is surrounded by four primary arms that spiral from the core. This is a region of active star formation that contains many younger, population I stars. The disk is surrounded by a spheroid halo of older, population II stars, as well as relatively dense concentrations of stars known as globular clusters.[90]\nBetween the stars lies the interstellar medium, a region of sparse matter. In the densest regions, molecular clouds of molecular hydrogen and other elements create star-forming regions. These begin as a compact pre-stellar core or dark nebulae, which concentrate and collapse (in volumes determined by the Jeans length) to form compact protostars.[91]\nAs the more massive stars appear, they transform the cloud into an H II region (ionized atomic hydrogen) of glowing gas and plasma. The stellar wind and supernova explosions from these stars eventually cause the cloud to disperse, often leaving behind one or more young open clusters of stars. These clusters gradually disperse, and the stars join the population of the Milky Way.[92]\nKinematic studies of matter in the Milky Way and other galaxies have demonstrated that there is more mass than can be accounted for by visible matter. A dark matter halo appears to dominate the mass, although the nature of this dark matter remains undetermined.[93]\nThe study of stars and stellar evolution is fundamental to our understanding of the Universe. The astrophysics of stars has been determined through observation and theoretical understanding; and from computer simulations of the interior.[94] Star formation occurs in dense regions of dust and gas, known as giant molecular clouds. When destabilized, cloud fragments can collapse under the influence of gravity, to form a protostar. A sufficiently dense, and hot, core region will trigger nuclear fusion, thus creating a main-sequence star.[91]\nAlmost all elements heavier than hydrogen and helium were created inside the cores of stars.[94]\nThe characteristics of the resulting star depend primarily upon its starting mass. The more massive the star, the greater its luminosity, and the more rapidly it fuses its hydrogen fuel into helium in its core. Over time, this hydrogen fuel is completely converted into helium, and the star begins to evolve. The fusion of helium requires a higher core temperature. A star with a high enough core temperature will push its outer layers outward while increasing its core density. The resulting red giant formed by the expanding outer layers enjoys a brief life span, before the helium fuel in the core is in turn consumed. Very massive stars can also undergo a series of evolutionary phases, as they fuse increasingly heavier elements.[95]\nThe final fate of the star depends on its mass, with stars of mass greater than about eight times the Sun becoming core collapse supernovae;[96] while smaller stars blow off their outer layers and leave behind the inert core in the form of a white dwarf. The ejection of the outer layers forms a planetary nebula.[97] The remnant of a supernova is a dense neutron star, or, if the stellar mass was at least three times that of the Sun, a black hole.[98] Closely orbiting binary stars can follow more complex evolutionary paths, such as mass transfer onto a white dwarf companion that can potentially cause a supernova.[99] Planetary nebulae and supernovae distribute the \"metals\" produced in the star by fusion to the interstellar medium; without them, all new stars (and their planetary systems) would be formed from hydrogen and helium alone.[100]\nAt a distance of about eight light-minutes, the most frequently studied star is the Sun, a typical main-sequence dwarf star of stellar class G2 V, and about 4.6 billion years (Gyr) old. The Sun is not considered a variable star, but it does undergo periodic changes in activity known as the sunspot cycle. This is an 11-year oscillation in sunspot number. Sunspots are regions of lower-than- average temperatures that are associated with intense magnetic activity.[101]\nThe Sun has steadily increased in luminosity by 40% since it first became a main-sequence star. The Sun has also undergone periodic changes in luminosity that can have a significant impact on the Earth.[102] The Maunder minimum, for example, is believed to have caused the Little Ice Age phenomenon during the Middle Ages.[103]\nAt the center of the Sun is the core region, a volume of sufficient temperature and pressure for nuclear fusion to occur. Above the core is the radiation zone, where the plasma conveys the energy flux by means of radiation. Above that is the convection zone where the gas material transports energy primarily through physical displacement of the gas known as convection. It is believed that the movement of mass within the convection zone creates the magnetic activity that generates sunspots.[101] The visible outer surface of the Sun is called the photosphere. Above this layer is a thin region known as the chromosphere. This is surrounded by a transition region of rapidly increasing temperatures, and finally by the super-heated corona.[62]:\u200a498\u2013502\nA solar wind of plasma particles constantly streams outward from the Sun until, at the outermost limit of the Solar System, it reaches the heliopause. As the solar wind passes the Earth, it interacts with the Earth's magnetic field (magnetosphere) and deflects the solar wind, but traps some creating the Van Allen radiation belts that envelop the Earth. The aurora are created when solar wind particles are guided by the magnetic flux lines into the Earth's polar regions where the lines then descend into the atmosphere.[104]\nPlanetary science is the study of the assemblage of planets, moons, dwarf planets, comets, asteroids, and other bodies orbiting the Sun, as well as extrasolar planets. The Solar System has been relatively well-studied, initially through telescopes and then later by spacecraft. This has provided a good overall understanding of the formation and evolution of the Sun's planetary system, although many new discoveries are still being made.[105]\nThe Solar System is divided into the inner Solar System (subdivided into the inner planets and the asteroid belt), the outer Solar System (subdivided into the outer planets and centaurs), comets, the trans-Neptunian region (subdivided into the Kuiper belt, and the scattered disc) and the farthest regions (e.g., boundaries of the heliosphere, and the Oort Cloud, which may extend as far as a light-year). The inner terrestrial planets consist of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. The outer giant planets are the gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn) and the ice giants (Uranus and Neptune).[106]\nThe planets were formed 4.6 billion years ago in the protoplanetary disk that surrounded the early Sun. Through a process that included gravitational attraction, collision, and accretion, the disk formed clumps of matter that, with time, became protoplanets. The radiation pressure of the solar wind then expelled most of the unaccreted matter, and only those planets with sufficient mass retained their gaseous atmosphere. The planets continued to sweep up, or eject, the remaining matter during a period of intense bombardment, evidenced by the many impact craters on the Moon. During this period, some of the protoplanets may have collided and one such collision may have formed the Moon.[107]\nOnce a planet reaches sufficient mass, the materials of different densities segregate within, during planetary differentiation. This process can form a stony or metallic core, surrounded by a mantle and an outer crust. The core may include solid and liquid regions, and some planetary cores generate their own magnetic field, which can protect their atmospheres from solar wind stripping.[108]\nA planet or moon's interior heat is produced from the collisions that created the body, by the decay of radioactive materials (e.g. uranium, thorium, and 26Al), or tidal heating caused by interactions with other bodies. Some planets and moons accumulate enough heat to drive geologic processes such as volcanism and tectonics. Those that accumulate or retain an atmosphere can also undergo surface erosion from wind or water. Smaller bodies, without tidal heating, cool more quickly; and their geological activity ceases with the exception of impact cratering.[109]\nAstronomy and astrophysics have developed significant interdisciplinary links with other major scientific fields. Archaeoastronomy is the study of ancient or traditional astronomies in their cultural context, utilizing archaeological and anthropological evidence. Astrobiology is the study of the advent and evolution of biological systems in the Universe, with particular emphasis on the possibility of non-terrestrial life. Astrostatistics is the application of statistics to astrophysics to the analysis of a vast amount of observational astrophysical data.[citation needed]\nThe study of chemicals found in space, including their formation, interaction and destruction, is called astrochemistry. These substances are usually found in molecular clouds, although they may also appear in low-temperature stars, brown dwarfs and planets. Cosmochemistry is the study of the chemicals found within the Solar System, including the origins of the elements and variations in the isotope ratios. Both of these fields represent an overlap of the disciplines of astronomy and chemistry. As \"forensic astronomy\", finally, methods from astronomy have been used to solve problems of art history[110][111] and occasionally of law.[112]\nAstronomy is one of the sciences to which amateurs can contribute the most.[113]\nCollectively, amateur astronomers observe a variety of celestial objects and phenomena sometimes with consumer-level equipment or equipment that they build themselves. Common targets of amateur astronomers include the Sun, the Moon, planets, stars, comets, meteor showers, and a variety of deep-sky objects such as star clusters, galaxies, and nebulae. Astronomy clubs are located throughout the world and many have programs to help their members set up and complete observational programs including those to observe all the objects in the Messier (110 objects) or Herschel 400 catalogues of points of interest in the night sky. One branch of amateur astronomy, astrophotography, involves the taking of photos of the night sky. Many amateurs like to specialize in the observation of particular objects, types of objects, or types of events that interest them.[114][115]\nMost amateurs work at visible wavelengths, but many experiment with wavelengths outside the visible spectrum. This includes the use of infrared filters on conventional telescopes, and also the use of radio telescopes. The pioneer of amateur radio astronomy was Karl Jansky, who started observing the sky at radio wavelengths in the 1930s. A number of amateur astronomers use either homemade telescopes or use radio telescopes which were originally built for astronomy research but which are now available to amateurs (e.g. the One-Mile Telescope).[116][117]\nAmateur astronomers continue to make scientific contributions to the field of astronomy and it is one of the few scientific disciplines where amateurs can still make significant contributions. Amateurs can make occultation measurements that are used to refine the orbits of minor planets. They can also discover comets, and perform regular observations of variable stars. Improvements in digital technology have allowed amateurs to make impressive advances in the field of astrophotography.[118][119][120]\nIn the 21st century there remain some important unanswered questions in astronomy; answers to them may require new ground- and space-based instruments, and new developments in theoretical and experimental physics.[citation needed]\nSolar System\u00a0\u2192

Wikipedia": {"text": "Eris (minor-planet designation 136199 Eris) is the most massive and second-largest known dwarf planet in the Solar System.[22] It is a trans-Neptunian object (TNO) in the scattered disk and has a high-eccentricity orbit. Eris was discovered in January 2005 by a Palomar Observatory\u2013based team led by Mike Brown and verified later that year. In September 2006, it was named after the Greco\u2013Roman goddess of strife and discord. Eris is the ninth-most massive known object orbiting the Sun and the sixteenth-most massive overall in the Solar System (counting moons). It is also the largest object that has not been visited by a spacecraft. Eris has been measured at 2,326\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012 kilometers (1,445\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07\u00a0mi) in diameter;[12] its mass is 0.28% that of the Earth and 27% greater than that of Pluto,[23][24] although Pluto is slightly larger by volume,[25] both having a surface area that is comparable to the area of Russia or Antarctica.\nEris has one large known moon, Dysnomia. In February 2016, Eris's distance from the Sun was 96.3\u00a0AU (14.41\u00a0billion\u00a0km; 8.95\u00a0billion\u00a0mi),[19] more than three times that of Neptune or Pluto. With the exception of long-period comets, Eris and Dysnomia were the most distant known natural objects in the Solar System until the discovery of 2018 VG18 in 2018.[19]\nBecause Eris appeared to be larger than Pluto, NASA initially described it as the Solar System's tenth planet. This, along with the prospect of other objects of similar size being discovered in the future, motivated the International Astronomical Union (IAU) to define the term planet for the first time. Under the IAU definition approved on August 24, 2006, Eris, Pluto and Ceres are \"dwarf planets\",[26] reducing the number of known planets in the Solar System to eight, the same as before Pluto's discovery in 1930. Observations of a stellar occultation by Eris in 2010 showed that it was slightly smaller than Pluto,[27][28] which was measured by New Horizons as having a mean diameter of 2,377\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 kilometers (1,477\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0mi) in July 2015.[29][30]\nEris was discovered by the team of Mike Brown, Chad Trujillo, and David Rabinowitz[2] on January 5, 2005, from images taken on October 21, 2003.[31] The discovery was announced on July 29, 2005, the same day as Makemake and two days after Haumea,[32] due in part to events that would later lead to controversy about Haumea. The search team had been systematically scanning for large outer Solar System bodies for several years, and had been involved in the discovery of several other large TNOs, including 50000 Quaoar, 90482 Orcus, and 90377 Sedna.[33]\nRoutine observations were taken by the team on October 21, 2003, using the 1.2\u00a0m Samuel Oschin Schmidt telescope at Palomar Observatory, California, but the image of Eris was not discovered at that point due to its very slow motion across the sky: The team's automatic image-searching software excluded all objects moving at less than 1.5\u00a0arcseconds per hour to reduce the number of false positives returned.[31] When Sedna was discovered in 2003, it was moving at 1.75\u00a0arcsec/h, and in light of that the team reanalyzed their old data with a lower limit on the angular motion, sorting through the previously excluded images by eye. In January 2005, the re-analysis revealed Eris's slow motion against the background stars.[31]\nFollow-up observations were then carried out to make a preliminary determination of Eris's orbit, which allowed the object's distance to be estimated.[31] The team had planned to delay announcing their discoveries of the bright objects Eris and Makemake until further observations and calculations were complete, but announced them both on July 29 when the discovery of another large TNO they had been tracking\u2014Haumea\u2014was controversially announced on July 27 by a different team in Spain.[2]\nPrecovery images of Eris have been identified back to September 3, 1954.[3]\nMore observations released in October 2005 revealed that Eris has a moon, later named Dysnomia. Observations of Dysnomia's orbit permitted scientists to determine the mass of Eris, which in June 2007 was calculated to be (1.66\u00b10.02)\u00d71022\u00a0kg,[23] 27%\u00b12% greater than Pluto's.\nEris is named after the Greek goddess Eris (Greek \u1f1c\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2), a personification of strife and discord.[34] The name was proposed by the Caltech team on September 6, 2006, and it was assigned on September 13, 2006,[35] following an unusually long period in which the object was known by the provisional designation 2003 UB313, which was granted automatically by the IAU under their naming protocols for minor planets.\nThe name Eris has two competing pronunciations, with a \"long\" or with a \"short\" e, analogous to the two competing pronunciations of the word era.[7] The classical English pronunciation of the goddess is /\u02c8\u026a\u0259r\u026as/, with a long e.[6] However, Brown and his students[36] use /\u02c8\u025br\u026as/, with disyllabic laxing and a short e.[8]\nThe Greek and Latin oblique stem of the name is Erid-,[37] as can be seen in Italian Eride and Russian \u042d\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0430 Erida, so the adjective in English is Eridian /\u025b\u02c8r\u026adi\u0259n/.[9][10]\nDue to uncertainty over whether the object would be classified as a planet or a minor planet, because varying nomenclature procedures apply to these classes of objects,[38] the decision on what to name the object had to wait until after the August 24, 2006, IAU ruling.[39] For a time the object became known to the wider public as Xena. \"Xena\" was an informal name used internally by the discovery team, inspired by the title character of the television series Xena: Warrior Princess. The discovery team had reportedly saved the nickname \"Xena\" for the first body they discovered that was larger than Pluto. According to Brown,\nWe chose it since it started with an X (planet \"X\"), it sounds mythological ... and we've been working to get more female deities out there (e.g. Sedna). Also, at the time, the TV\u00a0show was still on TV, which shows you how long we've been searching![40]\nBrown said in an interview that the naming process was stalled:\nOne reporter [Ken Chang][41] called me up from The New York Times who happened to have been a friend of mine from college, [and] ... asked me, \"What's the name you guys proposed?\" and I said, \"Well, I'm not going to tell.\" And he said, \"Well, what do you guys call it when you're just talking amongst yourselves?\"\u00a0... As far as I remember this was the only time I told anybody this in the press, and then it got everywhere, which I only sorta felt bad about; I kinda like the name.[42]\nAccording to science writer Govert Schilling, Brown initially wanted to call the object \"Lila\", after a concept in Hindu mythology that described the cosmos as the outcome of a game played by Brahman.[33] The name could be pronounced like \"Lilah\", the name of Brown's newborn daughter. Brown was mindful of not making his name public before it had been officially accepted. He had done so with Sedna a year previously, and had been heavily criticized. However, no objection was raised to the Sedna name other than the breach of protocol, and no competing names were suggested for Sedna.[43]\nHe listed the address of his personal web page announcing the discovery as /~mbrown/planetlila and in the chaos following the controversy over the discovery of Haumea, forgot to change it. Rather than needlessly anger more of his fellow astronomers, he simply said that the webpage had been named for his daughter and dropped \"Lila\" from consideration.[33]\nBrown had also speculated that Persephone, the wife of the god Pluto, would be a good name for the object.[2] The name had been used several times for planets in science fiction[44] and was popular with the public, having handily won a poll conducted by New Scientist magazine.[45] (\"Xena\", despite only being a nickname, came fourth.) This choice was not possible once the object was classified as a dwarf (and thus minor) planet, because there was already a minor planet with that name, 399 Persephone.[2]\nThe discovery team proposed Eris on September 6, 2006. On September 13, 2006, this was accepted as the official name by the IAU.[46][47] Brown decided that, because the object had been considered a planet for so long, it deserved a name from Greek or Roman mythology like the other planets. The asteroids had taken the vast majority of Graeco-Roman names. Eris, whom Brown described as his favorite goddess, had fortunately escaped inclusion.[42] \"Eris caused strife and discord by causing quarrels among people,\" said Brown in 2006, \"and that's what this one has done too.\"[48]\nPlanetary symbols are no longer much used in astronomy, but NASA has used the Hand of Eris, \u27e8\u27e9 (U+2BF0), for Eris.[49] This is a symbol from Discordianism, a religion that worships the goddess Eris.[50] Most astrologers use this symbol, while some use a symbol resembling that of Mars but with the arrow pointing downward, \u27e8\u27e9 (U+2BF1).[50] Both symbols have been included in Unicode.[51]\nEris is a trans-Neptunian dwarf planet (plutoid).[52] Its orbital characteristics more specifically categorize it as a scattered-disk object (SDO), or a TNO that has been \"scattered\" from the Kuiper belt into more-distant and unusual orbits following gravitational interactions with Neptune as the Solar System was forming. Although its high orbital inclination is unusual among the known SDOs, theoretical models suggest that objects that were originally near the inner edge of the Kuiper belt were scattered into orbits with higher inclinations than objects from the outer belt.[53]\nBecause Eris was initially thought to be larger than Pluto, it was described as the \"tenth planet\" by NASA and in media reports of its discovery.[54] In response to the uncertainty over its status, and because of ongoing debate over whether Pluto should be classified as a planet, the IAU delegated a group of astronomers to develop a sufficiently precise definition of the term planet to decide the issue. This was announced as the IAU's Definition of a Planet in the Solar System, adopted on August 24, 2006. At this time, both Eris and Pluto were classified as dwarf planets, a category distinct from the new definition of planet.[55] Brown has since stated his approval of this classification.[56] The IAU subsequently added Eris to its Minor Planet Catalogue, designating it (136199) Eris.[39]\nEris has an orbital period of 559 years.[19] Its maximum possible distance from the Sun (aphelion) is 97.5\u00a0AU, and its closest (perihelion) is 38\u00a0AU.[19] As the time of perihelion is defined at the epoch chosen using an unperturbed two-body solution, the further the epoch is from the date of perihelion, the less accurate the result. Numerical integration is required to predict the time of perihelion accurately. Numerical integration by JPL Horizons shows that Eris came to perihelion around 1699,[11] to aphelion around 1977,[11] and will return to perihelion around December 2257.[11] Unlike the eight planets, whose orbits all lie roughly in the same plane as the Earth's, Eris's orbit is highly inclined: it is tilted at an angle of about 44\u00a0degrees to the ecliptic.[3] When discovered, Eris and its moon were the most distant known objects in the Solar System, apart from long-period comets and space probes.[2][57] It retained this distinction until the discovery of 2018 VG18 in 2018.[58]\nAs of 2008, there were approximately forty known TNOs, most notably 2006 SQ372, 2000 OO67 and Sedna, that are currently closer to the Sun than Eris, even although their semimajor axis is larger than that of Eris (67.8\u00a0AU).[4]\nEris's orbit is highly eccentric, and brings Eris to within 37.9\u00a0AU of the Sun, a typical perihelion for scattered objects.[59]  This is within the orbit of Pluto, but still safe from direct interaction with Neptune (~37 AU).[60] Pluto, on the other hand, like other plutinos, follows a less inclined and less eccentric orbit and, protected by orbital resonance, can cross Neptune's orbit.[61] In about 800\u00a0years, Eris will be closer to the Sun than Pluto for some time (see the graph at the left).\nAs of 2007, Eris has an apparent magnitude of 18.7, making it bright enough to be detectable to some amateur telescopes.[62] A 200-millimeter (7.9\u00a0in) telescope with a CCD can detect Eris under favorable conditions.[f] The reason it had not been noticed until now is its steep orbital inclination; searches for large outer Solar System objects tend to concentrate on the ecliptic plane, where most bodies are found.[63]\nBecause of the high inclination of its orbit, Eris passes through only a few constellations of the traditional Zodiac; it is now in the constellation Cetus. It was in Sculptor from 1876 until 1929 and Phoenix from roughly 1840 until 1875. In 2036 it will enter Pisces and stay there until 2065, when it will enter Aries.[11] It will then move into the northern sky, entering Perseus in 2128 and Camelopardalis (where it will reach its northernmost declination) in 2173.\nEris displays very little variation in brightness as it rotates due to its uniform surface, making measurement of its rotation period difficult.[64][15] Precise long-term monitoring of Eris's brightness indicates that it is tidally locked to its moon Dysnomia, with a rotation period synchronous with the moon's orbital period of 15.78 Earth days.[15] Dysnomia is also tidally locked to Eris, which makes the Eris\u2013Dysnomia system the second known case of double-synchronous rotation, after Pluto and Charon. Previous measurements of Eris's rotation period obtained highly uncertain values ranging tens of hours to several days due to insufficient long-term coverage of Eris's rotation.[64][65][66] The axial tilt of Eris has not been measured,[14] but it can be reasonably assumed that it is the same as Dysnomia's orbital inclination, which would be about 78\u00a0degrees with respect to the ecliptic.[16] If this were the case, most of Eris's northern hemisphere would be illuminated by sunlight, with 30% of the hemisphere experiencing constant illumination in 2018.[16]\nIn November 2010, Eris was the subject of one of the most distant stellar occultations yet from Earth.[13] Preliminary data from this event cast doubt on previous size estimates.[13] The teams announced their final results from the occultation in October 2011, with an estimated diameter of 2326\u00b112\u00a0km.[12]\nThis makes Eris a little smaller than Pluto by area and diameter, which is 2372\u00b14\u00a0km across, although Eris is more massive. It also indicates a geometric albedo of 0.96. It is speculated that the high albedo is due to the surface ices being replenished because of temperature fluctuations as Eris's eccentric orbit takes it closer and farther from the Sun.[20]\nThe mass of Eris can be calculated with much greater precision. Based on the accepted value for Dysnomia's period at the time\u201415.774 days[23][69]\u2014Eris is 27% more massive than Pluto. Using the 2011 occultation results, Eris has a density of 2.52\u00b10.07\u00a0g/cm3,[g] substantially denser than Pluto, and thus must be composed largely of rocky materials.[12]\nModels of internal heating via radioactive decay suggest that Eris could have an internal ocean of liquid water at the mantle\u2013core boundary.[70]\nIn July 2015, after nearly ten years of Eris being considered the ninth-largest object known to directly orbit the sun, close-up imagery from the New Horizons mission more accurately determined Pluto's volume to be slightly larger than Eris's, rather than slightly smaller as previously thought.[71] Eris is now the tenth-largest object known to directly orbit the sun by volume, but remains the ninth-largest by mass.\nThe discovery team followed up their initial identification of Eris with spectroscopic observations made at the 8\u00a0m Gemini North Telescope in Hawaii on January 25, 2005. Infrared light from the object revealed the presence of methane ice, indicating that the surface may be similar to that of Pluto, which at the time was the only TNO known to have surface methane, and of Neptune's moon Triton, which also has methane on its surface.[72]\nDue to Eris's distant eccentric orbit, its surface temperature is estimated to vary between about 30 and 56\u00a0K (\u2212243.2 and \u2212217.2\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212405.7 and \u2212358.9\u00a0\u00b0F).[2]\nUnlike the somewhat reddish Pluto and Triton, Eris appears almost white.[2] Pluto's reddish color is thought to be due to deposits of tholins on its surface, and where these deposits darken the surface, the lower albedo leads to higher temperatures and the evaporation of methane deposits. In contrast, Eris is far enough from the Sun that methane can condense onto its surface even where the albedo is low. The condensation of methane uniformly over the surface reduces any albedo contrasts and would cover up any deposits of red tholins.[31]\nEven though Eris can be up to three times farther from the Sun than Pluto, it approaches close enough that some of the ices on the surface might warm enough to sublime. Because methane is highly volatile, its presence shows either that Eris has always resided in the distant reaches of the Solar System, where it is cold enough for methane ice to persist, or that the celestial body has an internal source of methane to replenish gas that escapes from its atmosphere. This contrasts with observations of another discovered TNO, Haumea, which reveal the presence of water ice but not methane.[73]\nIn 2005, the adaptive optics team at the Keck telescopes in Hawaii carried out observations of the four brightest TNOs (Pluto, Makemake, Haumea, and Eris), using the newly commissioned laser guide star adaptive optics system.[74] Images taken on September 10 revealed a moon in orbit around Eris. In keeping with the \"Xena\" nickname already in use for Eris, Brown's team nicknamed the moon \"Gabrielle\", after the television warrior princess's sidekick. When Eris received its official name from the IAU, the moon received the name Dysnomia, after the Greek goddess of lawlessness who was Eris's daughter. Brown says he picked it for similarity to his wife's name, Diane. The name also retains an oblique reference to Eris's old informal name Xena, portrayed on television by Lucy Lawless.[75]\n(km)\n(1022\u00a0kg)\nEris was observed from afar by the outbound New Horizons spacecraft in May 2020, as part of its extended mission following its successful Pluto flyby in 2015.[17] Although Eris was farther from New Horizons (112\u00a0AU) than it was from Earth (96\u00a0AU), the spacecraft's unique vantage point inside the Kuiper belt permitted observations of Eris at high phase angles that are otherwise unobtainable from Earth, enabling the determination of the light scattering properties and phase curve behavior of Eris's surface.[17]\nIn the 2010s, there were multiple studies for follow-on missions to explore the Kuiper belt, among which Eris was evaluated as a candidate.[77] It was calculated that a flyby mission to Eris would take 24.66 years using a Jupiter gravity-assist, based on launch dates of April 3, 2032, or April 7, 2044. Eris would be 92.03 or 90.19 AU from the Sun when the spacecraft arrives.[78]\nSolar System\u00a0\u2192 Local Interstellar Cloud\u00a0\u2192 Local Bubble\u00a0\u2192 Gould Belt\u00a0\u2192 Orion

"Controversy over the discovery of Haumea - Wikipedia": {"text": "Haumea was the first of the IAU-recognized dwarf planets to be discovered since Pluto in 1930. Its naming as a dwarf planet was delayed by several years due to controversy over who should receive credit for its discovery. A California Institute of Technology (Caltech) team headed by Michael E. Brown first noticed the object, but a Spanish team headed by Jos\u00e9 Luis Ortiz Moreno were the first to announce it, and so normally would receive credit. Brown accused the Spanish team of fraud, using Caltech observations without credit to make their discovery, while the Ortiz team accused the American team of political interference with the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The IAU officially recognized the Californian team's proposed name Haumea over the name proposed by the Spanish team, Ataecina, in September 2008.\nOn December 28, 2004, Mike Brown and his team discovered Haumea on images they had taken with the 1.3\u00a0m SMARTS Telescope from the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile at the Palomar Observatory in the United States on May 6, 2004, while looking for what he hoped would be the tenth planet. The Caltech discovery team used the nickname \"Santa\" among themselves, because they had discovered Haumea on December 28, 2004, just after Christmas.[1][2] However, it was clearly too small to be a planet, because it was significantly smaller than Pluto, and Brown did not announce the discovery. Instead he kept it under wraps, along with several other large trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs), pending additional observation to better determine their natures.[3][4][5] When his team discovered Haumea's moons, they realized that Haumea was more rocky than other TNOs, and that its moons were mostly ice.[6] They then discovered a small family of nearby icy TNOs, and concluded that these were remnants of Haumea's icy mantle, which had been blasted off by a collision.[7] On July 7, 2005, while he was finishing the paper describing the discovery, Brown's daughter Lilah was born, which delayed the announcement further.[8] On July 20,[9] the Caltech team published an online abstract of a report intended to announce the discovery at a conference the following September. In this Haumea was given the code K40506A.[10]\nAt around that time, Pablo Santos Sanz, a student of Jos\u00e9 Luis Ortiz Moreno at the Instituto de Astrof\u00edsica de Andaluc\u00eda at Sierra Nevada Observatory in southern Spain, claims to have examined the backlog of photos that the Ortiz team had started taking in December 2002. He says that he found Haumea in late July 2005, on images taken on March 7, 9, and 10, 2003. He further said that in checking whether this was a known object, the team came across Brown's internet summary, describing a bright TNO much like the one they had just found. Googling the reference number for object K40506A on the morning of July 26, they found the Caltech observation logs of Haumea, but according to their account, those logs contained too little information for Ortiz to tell if they were the same object.[4][11][12][13]\nThe Ortiz team also checked with the Minor Planet Center (MPC), which had no record of this object. Wanting to establish priority, they emailed the MPC with their discovery on the night of July 27, 2005, titled \"Big TNO discovery, urgent\",[14] without making any mention of the Caltech logs. The next morning they again accessed the Caltech logs, including observations from several additional nights. They then asked Reiner Stoss at the amateur Astronomical Observatory of Mallorca for further observations. Stoss found precovery images of Haumea in digitized Palomar Observatory slides from 1955, and located Haumea with his own telescope that night, July 28. Within an hour,[9] the Ortiz team submitted a second report to the MPC that included this new data. Again, no mention was made of having accessed the Caltech logs.[15] The data was published by the MPC on July 29.[15]\nIn a press release on the same day, the Ortiz team called Haumea the \"tenth planet\".[16] On July 29, 2005, Haumea was given its first official label, the temporary designation 2003\u00a0EL61, with the \"2003\" based on the date of the Spanish discovery image.[17]  On September 7, 2006, it was numbered and admitted into the official minor planet catalogue as (136108) 2003\u00a0EL61.[18]\nThe same day as the MPC publication, Brown's group announced the discovery of another Kuiper belt object, Eris, more distant, brighter and apparently larger than Pluto, as the tenth planet. The announcement was made earlier than planned to forestall the possibility of similar events with that discovery, when the MPC told them that their observational data was publicly accessible, and they realized that not only Haumea data but by that time their Eris data had been publicly accessed.[3][19] The same day Ortiz announced the discovery of Haumea, Brown submitted his own draft with the data on the first of its moons that he had discovered on January 26, 2005, to The Astrophysical Journal.[6]\nBrown, though disappointed at being scooped, congratulated the Ortiz team on their discovery. He apologized for immediately overshadowing their announcement of Haumea with his announcement of Eris, and explained that someone had accessed their data and he was afraid of being scooped again. Ortiz did not volunteer to say that it had been he who accessed the data. Upon learning from web server records that it was a computer at the Sierra Nevada Observatory that had accessed his observation logs the day before the discovery announcement\u00a0\u2013 logs which included enough information to allow the Ortiz team to precover Haumea in their 2003 images\u00a0\u2013 Brown came to suspect fraud. He emailed Ortiz on August 9 and asked for an explanation. Ortiz responded saying that Brown's penchant for \"hiding objects\" had alienated other astronomers and harmed science[20] (see Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their moons to verify typical time scale of observation and publication of discoveries).\nOn August 15 the Caltech team filed a formal complaint with the IAU, accusing the Ortiz team of a serious breach of scientific ethics in failing to acknowledge their use of the Caltech data, and asked the MPC to strip them of discovery status.[21] Ortiz later admitted he had accessed the Caltech observation logs but denied any wrongdoing, stating this was merely part of verifying whether they had discovered a new object.[22] Brown began to wonder if the Spanish team had actually identified Haumea at all before they saw his own abstract and telescope log, noting that Ortiz' team claimed to have sat on their data for a period of 28 months until Brown's upload of his abstract, then coincidentally identified Haumea within the six days prior to accessing his abstract.[19]\nIAU protocol is that discovery credit for a minor planet goes to whoever first submits a report to the MPC with enough positional data for a decent orbit determination, and that the credited discoverer has priority in naming it. This was Ortiz et al., and they proposed the name Ataecina, an Iberian goddess of the underworld. She is the equivalent of the Roman goddess Proserpina, who was in turn one of Pluto's lovers.[11] However, as a chthonic deity, Ataecina would only have been an appropriate name for an object in a stable orbital resonance with Neptune (see astronomical naming conventions), and Haumea's resonance (if known of by the Spanish team) was unstable.[23]\nFollowing guidelines established by the IAU that classical Kuiper belt objects be given names of mythological beings associated with creation,[24] in September 2006 the Caltech team submitted formal names from Hawaiian mythology to the IAU for both (136108) 2003\u00a0EL61 and its moons, in order \"to pay homage to the place where the satellites were discovered\".[25] The names were proposed by David Rabinowitz of the Caltech team.[26] Haumea is the tutelary goddess of the island of Hawai\u02bbi, where the Mauna Kea Observatory is located. In addition, she is identified with Papa, the goddess of the earth and wife of W\u0101kea (space),[27] which is appropriate because 2003\u00a0EL61 is thought to be composed almost entirely of solid rock, without the thick ice mantle over a small rocky core typical of other known Kuiper belt objects.[7][28] Lastly, Haumea is the goddess of fertility and childbirth, with many children who sprang from different parts of her body;[27] this corresponds to the swarm of icy bodies thought to have broken off the dwarf planet during an ancient collision.[7] The two known moons, also believed to have been born in this manner,[7] were thus named after two of Haumea's daughters, Hi\u02bbiaka and N\u0101maka.[28]\nThe dispute over who had discovered the object delayed the acceptance of either name. On 17 September 2008, the IAU announced that the two bodies in charge of naming dwarf planets, the Committee on Small Body Nomenclature (CSBN) and the Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (WGPSN), had decided on the Caltech proposal of Haumea.[29][30] At the CSBN, the outcome of the voting was very close,[13] eventually being decided by a single vote.[11] However, the date of the discovery was listed on the announcement as March 7, 2003, the location of discovery as the Sierra Nevada Observatory, and the name of the discoverer was left blank.[23][31][32]\nBrian G. Marsden, head of the MPC at Harvard who had supported Brown on previous naming disputes,[33] again supported Brown, saying that \"Sooner or later, posterity will realise what happened, and Mike Brown will get the full credit\".[23] He went on to state, in reference to the name of the discoverer, which was left blank in the IAU listing, that \"It's deliberately vague about the discoverer of the object [...] We don't want to cause an international incident.\" He called the whole controversy the worst since the early 17th-century dispute over who found the four biggest satellites of Jupiter between Galileo Galilei and Simon Marius,[12] ultimately won by Galileo.[34]\nThe Ortiz team objected, suggesting that if Ataecina were not accepted the IAU could at least have chosen a third name favoring neither party, and accusing the IAU of political bias. Rumors appeared that Dagda, the name of a god from Irish mythology and a \"neutral\" name, was indeed proposed by a member of the CSBM but was not used in the end.[35] Ortiz went on to say \"I am not happy, I think the [IAU] decision is unfortunate and sets a bad precedent.\"[12] The Spanish newspaper ABC  went on to call the decision a \"US conquest\", asserting that politics played a major role as the US had 10 times more astronomers in the IAU than Spain had.[36]\nImmediately after the announcement of the name, Brown noted that it is unusual to be allowed to name an object without being acknowledged as its official discoverer but declared that he is pleased with the outcome and that he \"think[s] this is as good a resolution as we'll get\".[12] He did get full recognition for the discovery of the two moons, Hi\u02bbiaka and Namaka.[32] On the fifth anniversary of the discovery he wrote a blog post with his thoughts on the importance of the discovery, but did not mention any events regarding the controversy.[37]", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy_over_the_discovery_of_Haumea", " https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/astronomy#bodyContent",

(including the Sun and the Moon) or one of the modern planets. The symbols were also used in alchemy to represent the metals associated with the planets, and in calendars for their associated days. The use of these symbols derives from Classical Greco-Roman astronomy, though their current shapes are a development of the 16th century.\nThe classical planets, their symbols, days and most commonly associated planetary metals are:\nThe International Astronomical Union (IAU) discourages the use of these symbols in modern journal articles, and their style manual proposes one- and two-letter abbreviations for the names of the planets for cases where planetary symbols might be used, such as in the headings of tables.[1]\nThe modern planets with their traditional symbols and IAU abbreviations are:\nThe symbols of Venus and Mars are also used to represent female and male in biology following a convention introduced by Carl Linnaeus in the 1750s.\nAntecedents of the planetary symbols are attested in the attributes given to classical deities. The Roman planisphere of Bianchini (2nd century, currently in the Louvre, inv. Ma 540)[3] shows the seven planets represented by portraits of the seven corresponding gods, each a bust with a halo and an iconic object or dress, as follows: Mercury has a caduceus and a winged cap; Venus has a necklace and a shining mirror; Mars has a war-helmet and a spear; Jupiter has a laurel crown and a staff; Saturn has a conical headdress and a scythe; the Sun has rays emanating from his head; and the Moon has a crescent atop her head.\nLuna with a crescent\nMercury with a caduceus\nVenus with a shining mirror\nSol emanating rays\nMars with a spear\nJupiter with a staff\nSaturn with a scythe\nThe written symbols for Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn have been traced to forms found in late Greek papyri.[4] Early forms are also found in medieval Byzantine codices which preserve horoscopes.[5]\nThe symbol for the Moon in a medieval Byzantine (11th c.) ms. The appearance in late Classical times was similar.[4]\nThe symbol for Mercury in late Classical (4th c.) and medieval Byzantine (11th c.) mss[4]\nThe symbol for Venus in late Classical (4th c.) and medieval Byzantine (11th c.) mss[4]\nThe disk with a ray as a symbol for the Sun in late Classical (4th c.) and medieval Byzantine (11th c.) mss[4]\nThe symbol for Mars in late Classical (6th c.) and medieval Byzantine (11th c.) mss.[4]\nThe symbol for Jupiter in late Classical (4th c.) and medieval Byzantine (11th c.) mss[4]\nThe symbol for Saturn in late Classical (4th & 5th c.) and medieval Byzantine (11th c.) mss.

These cross-marks first appear in the late 15th or early 16th century. According to Maunder, the addition of crosses appears to be \"an attempt to give a savour of Christianity to the symbols of the old pagan gods.\"[6]\nThe modern forms of the classical planetary symbols are found in a woodcut of the seven planets in a Latin translation of Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi's De Magnis Coniunctionibus printed at Venice in 1506, represented as the corresponding gods riding chariots.[7]\nEarly modern depiction of the planet symbols in an alchemical context (Musaeum Hermeticum, 1678)\nPage spread (with the  signs for Mars and Venus) from a 1515 illustrated edition of Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi's De Magnis Coniunctionibus  (in the by translation by Herman of Carinthia, c. 1140, editio princeps by  Erhard Ratdolt of Augsburg,  1489).\nDepiction of the planets in a 15th-century Arabic manuscript of Abu Ma'shar's  \"Book of nativities\"[8]\nMedieval  planisphere showing the zodiac and the classical planets.

This is a circle crossed by a horizontal and vertical line, representing the world divided by four rivers into the four quarters of the world (often translated as the four \"corners\" of the world): . A variant, now obsolete, had only the horizontal line: .[9]\nA medieval European symbol for the world \u2013 the globus cruciger,  (the globe surmounted by a Christian cross) \u2013 is also used as a planetary symbol; it resembles an inverted symbol for Venus.\nThe planetary symbols for Earth are encoded in Unicode at U+1F728 \ud83d\udf28 ALCHEMICAL SYMBOL FOR VERDIGRIS and U+2641 \u2641 EARTH.\nThe Olympian gods, atop a -shaped world\nStylized Earth symbol\nA simple globus cruciger\nThree globi crucigeri in the coat of arms of Maschwanden in Switzerland\nIn the flag of Uppsala, the globe of the globus cruciger is stylized as a T-and-O map,\nIn this globus cruciger, the cross is surmounted on a celestial orb with stars\nThe crescent shape has been used to represent the Moon since earliest times. In classical antiquity, it is worn by lunar deities (Selene/Luna, Artemis/Diana, Men, etc.) either on the head or behind the shoulders, with its horns pointing upward. \nThe representation of the moon as a simple crescent with the horns pointing to the side (as a heraldic crescent increscent or crescent decrescent) is attested from late Classical times.\nThe same symbol can be used in a different context not for the Moon itself but for a lunar phase, as part of a sequence of four symbols\nfor \"new moon\" (U+1F311 \ud83c\udf11\ufe0e), \"waxing\" (U+263D \u263d\ufe0e), \"full moon\" (U+1F315 \ud83c\udf15\ufe0e) and \"waning\" (U+263E \u263e\ufe0e).\nThe Moon symbol, representing silver mining, in the municipal coat of arms  of Sala in Sweden\nThe Moon symbol in the municipal coat of arms of Silvbergs ('Silver Mountain') in Sweden\nStylized Moon symbol\nThe symbol \u263f for Mercury is a caduceus (a staff intertwined with two serpents), a symbol associated with Mercury/Hermes throughout antiquity. Some time after the 11th century, a cross was added to the bottom of the staff to make it seem more Christian.[4]\nThe god Hermes (Mercury) with his caduceus\nThe caduceus, copied from pottery\nThe caduceus in a tapestry, 3rd century\nMercury symbol, representing quicksilver mining, in the municipal coat of arms of Stahlberg, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany.\nStylized Mercury symbol\nThe \u263f symbol has also been used to indicate intersex, transgender, or non-binary gender.[10] A related usage is for the 'worker' or 'neuter' sex among social insects that is neither male nor (due to its lack of reproductive capacity) fully female, such as for example worker bees.[11] It was also once the designated symbol for hermaphroditic or 'perfect' flowers,[12] but botanists now use \u26a5 for these instead.[13]\nIts Unicode codepoint is U+263F \u263f MERCURY.\nThe Venus symbol, \u2640, consists of a circle with a small cross below it. \nIt has been interpreted as a depiction of the hand-mirror of the goddess, which may also explain Venus's association with the planetary metal copper, as mirrors in antiquity were made of polished copper (alloy),[14] though this is not certain.[4] In the Greek Oxyrhynchus Papyri 235, the symbols for Venus and Mercury didn't have the cross on the bottom stroke,[4] and Venus still appears without the cross (\u26b2) in Johannes Kamateros (12th century).\nIn  botany and biology, the symbol for Venus is used to represent the female sex, alongside the symbol for Mars representing the male sex,[15] following a convention introduced by Linnaeus in the 1750s.[12] Arising from the biological convention, the symbol also came to be used in sociological contexts to represent women or femininity.\nUnicode encodes the symbol as U+2640 \u2640 FEMALE SIGN (&female;), in the Miscellaneous Symbols block.[16]\nA bronze mirror, of the type associated with Venus\nCupid holding up a similar mirror to Venus\nThe Venus symbol, representing copper mining, in the municipal coat of arms of Falun Municipality in Sweden (1932).[17]\nRaised fist within Venus symbol, used as a symbol of second-wave feminism (1960s)[18]\nStylized Venus symbol\nThe modern astronomical symbol for the Sun, the circumpunct (U+2609 \u2609 SUN), was first used in the Renaissance. It possibly represents Apollo's golden shield with a boss; it is unknown if it traces descent from the nearly identical Egyptian hieroglyph for the Sun.\nBianchini's planisphere, produced in the 2nd century, shows  a circlet with rays radiating from it.[6][3]\nIn late Classical times, the Sun is attested as a circle with a single ray. A diagram in Johannes Kamateros' 12th century Compendium of Astrology shows the same symbol.[20]  This older symbol is encoded by Unicode as U+1F71A \ud83d\udf1a ALCHEMICAL SYMBOL FOR GOLD in the Alchemical Symbols block. Both symbols have been used alchemically for gold, as have more elaborate symbols showing a disk with multiple rays or even a face.\nA buckler with a sun symbol and dot at center\nStylized circumpunct symbol for the Sun\nThe Mars symbol, \u2642, is a depiction of a circle with an arrow emerging from it, pointing at an angle to the upper right in Europe and to the upper left in India. As astrological symbol it represents the planet Mars.[21][22] It is also the old and obsolete symbol for iron in alchemy. In zoology and botany, it is used to represent the male sex (alongside the astrological symbol for Venus representing the female sex),[15] following a convention introduced by Linnaeus in the 1750s.[12]\nThe symbol dates from at latest the 11th century, at which time it was an arrow across or through a circle, thought to represent the shield and spear of the god Mars; in the medieval form, for example in the 12th-century Compendium of Astrology by Johannes Kamateros, the spear is drawn across the shield.[20] The Greek Oxyrhynchus Papyri show a different symbol,[4] perhaps simply a spear.[3]\n3rd-century coin with Mars on the reverse, with lance and shield.

The horizontal stroke was added along with the \"Christianization\" of other symbols in the early 16th century.\nIts Unicode codepoint is U+2644 \u2644 SATURN.\nEmblem of the Fraternitas Saturni, a German magical order founded in 1926\nThe Saturn symbol representing lead in the municipal coat of arms of Bleiw\u00e4sche, since 1975 part of Bad W\u00fcnnenberg, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany\nStylized Saturn symbol\nThe symbols for Uranus were created shortly after its discovery in 1781. One symbol, \u26e2, invented by J. G. K\u00f6hler and refined by Bode, was intended to represent the newly discovered metal platinum; since platinum, commonly called white gold, was found by chemists mixed with iron, the symbol for platinum combines the alchemical symbols for iron, \u2642, and gold, \u2609.[23][24] Gold and iron are the planetary metals for the Sun and Mars, and so share their symbols. Several orientations were suggested, but an upright arrow is now universal.\nAnother symbol, \u2645, was suggested by Lalande in 1784. In a letter to Herschel, Lalande described it as \"un globe surmont\u00e9 par la premi\u00e8re lettre de votre nom\" (\"a globe surmounted by the first letter of your name\").[25] The platinum symbol tends to be used by astronomers and the monogram by astrologers.[26]\nFor use in computer systems, the symbols are encoded U+26E2 \u26e2 ASTRONOMICAL SYMBOL FOR URANUS and U+2645 \u2645 URANUS.\nThe planetary symbols as rendered in 1784, including the newly discovered Uranus (left)[23]\nThe Uranus platinum symbol on William Herschel's heraldry (center, blue background)\nStylized Uranus monogram\nSeveral symbols were proposed for Neptune to accompany the suggested names for the planet. Claiming the right to name his discovery, Urbain Le Verrier originally proposed to name the planet for the Roman God Neptune[27] and the symbol of a trident,[28] while falsely stating that this had been officially approved by the French Bureau des Longitudes.[27] In October, he sought to name the planet Leverrier, after himself, and he had loyal support in this from the observatory director, Fran\u00e7ois Arago,[29] who in turn proposed a new symbol for the planet, \u2bc9 ().[30] However, this suggestion met with resistance outside France,[29] and French almanacs quickly reintroduced the name Herschel for Uranus, after that planet's discoverer Sir William Herschel, and Leverrier for the new planet,[31] though it was used by anglophone institutions.[32]\nProfessor James Pillans of the University of Edinburgh defended the name Janus for the new planet, and proposed a key for its symbol.[28] Meanwhile, Struve presented the name Neptune on December 29, 1846, to the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences.[33] In August 1847, the Bureau des Longitudes announced its decision to follow prevailing astronomical practice and adopt the choice of Neptune, with Arago refraining from participating in this decision.[34]\nThe planetary symbol was Neptune's trident, with the handle stylized either as a cross , following Mercury, Venus and the asteroids, or as an orb , following the symbols for Uranus and Earth.[9] The cross variant is the more common today.\nFor use in computer systems, the symbols are encoded as U+2646 \u2646 NEPTUNE and U+2BC9 \u2bc9 NEPTUNE FORM TWO.\nAthena (Pallas) with her lance and Poseidon (Neptune) with his trident.

Planetary geologists[35] and astrologers continue to treat it as a planet. The original planetary symbol for Pluto was a monogram of the letters P and L. Astrologers generally use a bident with an orb. NASA has used the bident symbol since Pluto's reclassification. These symbols are encoded as U+2647 \u2647 PLUTO and U+2BD3 \u2bd3 PLUTO FORM TWO.\nPluto holding a bident\nPluto with a bident\nPluto symbol stylized as an inverted Mercury\nPluto compared in size to Earth's moon in a NASA publication\n\u2bd6, an astrological symbol used for Pluto in Germany and Denmark, representing Pluto's orbit crossing Neptune's\n\u2bd4, an astrological symbol used in the Mediterranean and Germany. The globe at bottom may be larger or omitted altogether.\nIn the 19th century, planetary symbols for the major asteroids were also in use, including 1 Ceres (a reaper's sickle, encoded U+26B3 \u26b3 CERES), 2 Pallas (a lance, U+26B4 \u26b4 PALLAS) and 3 Juno (a sceptre, encoded U+26B5 \u26b5 JUNO).\nEncke (1850) used symbols for 5 Astraea, 6 Hebe, 7 Iris, 8 Flora and 9 Metis in the Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch.[36]\nIn the late 20th century, astrologers abbreviated the symbol for 4 Vesta (the sacred fire of Vesta, encoded U+26B6 \u26b6 VESTA),[37] and introduced new symbols for 5 Astraea (, a stylised\u00a0% sign, shift-5 on the keyboard for asteroid 5), 10 Hygiea (a caduceus \u2013 a common error in the USA for a staff of Asclepius, itself an error for the snake symbol of Hygiea \u2013 encoded U+2BDA \u2bda HYGIEA)[38] and for 2060 Chiron, discovered in 1977 (a key, U+26B7 \u26b7 CHIRON).[37] Chiron's symbol was adapted as additional centaurs were discovered; symbols for 5145 Pholus and 7066 Nessus have been encoded in Unicode.[38] The abbreviation of the Vesta symbol is now universal, and the astrological symbol for Pluto has been used astronomically for Pluto as a dwarf planet.[39]\nIn the early 21st century, symbols for the trans-Neptunian dwarf planets have come into use, particularly Eris (the hand of Eris, \u2bf0, but also \u2bf1), Sedna, Haumea, Makemake, Gonggong, Quaoar and Orcus which are in Unicode. All (except Eris, for which the hand of Eris is a traditional Discordian symbol) were devised by Denis Moskowitz, a software engineer in Massachusetts.[39][40]\nCeres with her sickle\nAthena (Pallas) with her lance (left)\nJuno with her scepter\nVesta's sacred fire\nHygiea with her snake (old astr. symbol )\nPetroglyph of Makemake\nOrcus's gape\nA human-headed serpent similar to depictions of Gonggong\nThe Hand of Eris from the Principia Discordia\nFrom 1845 to 1855, many symbols were created for newly discovered asteroids. But by 1851, the spate of discoveries had led to a general abandonment of these symbols in favour of numbering all asteroids instead.[42]\nAstraea with her scales (astronomical symbol )\nHebe bearing a cup (astr. symbol )\nIris as the rainbow (astr. symbol )\nFlora dispensing flowers (astr. symbol )\nParthenope with her lyre (astr. symbol )\nVictory with a laurel wreath (astr. symbol  or )\nPeace (Irene) as a freed dove (astr. symbol )\nPeace with wings and an olive branch\nPsyche with butterfly wings (astr. symbol )\nPsyche accompanied by a butterfly, and Hermes with a multiply twisted caduceus\nPsyche with butterfly wings, and Charon standing in his lunate boat\nThetis with a dolphin (astro. symbol )\nMelpomene with a dagger (astr. symbol )\nFortuna with her wheel (astro. symbol )\nblindfolded Fortuna balanced on a wheel\nProserpina with a pomegranate (astr. symbol )\nBellona with a lance and flail (astro. symbol )\nAmphitrite on a shell (astr. symbol )\nMoskowitz, who designed symbols for the trans-Neptunian dwarf planets, also designed symbols for the smaller trans-Neptunian objects Varuna, Ixion, and Salacia. Others have proposed symbols for even more trans-Neptunian objects, e.g. Zane Stein for Varda. Although mentioned in the Unicode proposal for the other dwarf planets, they lack broader adoption.[39]\nSalacia riding her hippocamp (symbol )\nIxion bound to his wheel (symbol  or )\nVaruna with his

Islamic astronomy comprises the astronomical developments made in the Islamic world, particularly during the Islamic Golden Age (9th\u201313th centuries), and mostly written in the Arabic language. These developments mostly took place in the Middle East, Central Asia, Al-Andalus, and North Africa, and later in the Far East and India. It closely parallels the genesis of other Islamic sciences in its assimilation of foreign material and the amalgamation of the disparate elements of that material to create a science with Islamic characteristics. These included Greek, Sassanid, and Indian works in particular, which were translated and built upon.\nIslamic astronomy played a significant role in the revival of Byzantine and European astronomy following the loss of knowledge during the early medieval period, notably with the production of Latin translations of Arabic works  during the 12th century. Islamic astronomy also had an influence on Chinese astronomy.\nA significant number of stars in the sky, such as Aldebaran, Altair and Deneb, and astronomical terms such as alidade, azimuth, and nadir, are still referred to by their Arabic names.  A large corpus of literature from Islamic astronomy remains today, numbering approximately 10,000 manuscripts scattered throughout the world, many of which have not been read or catalogued. Even so, a reasonably accurate picture of Islamic activity in the field of astronomy can be reconstructed.\nThe Islamic historian Ahmad Dallal notes that, unlike the Babylonians, Greeks, and Indians, who had developed elaborate systems of mathematical astronomical study, the pre-Islamic Arabs relied upon empirical observations. These were based on the rising and setting of particular stars, and this indigenous constellation tradition was known as Anw\u0101\u2019. The study of Anw\u0101\u2019 was developed after Islamization when Arab astronomers introduced mathematics to their study of the night sky.[1]\nThe first astronomical texts that were translated into Arabic were of Indian[2][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]  and Persian origin.[3] The most notable was Zij al-Sindhind, a zij produced by Mu\u1e25ammad ibn Ibr\u0101h\u012bm al-Faz\u0101r\u012b and Ya\u02bfq\u016bb ibn \u1e6c\u0101riq, who  translated an 8th century Indian astronomical work after 770, with the assistance of Indian astronomers who were at the court of caliph Al-Mansur.[2][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] Zij al-Shah was also based upon Indian astronomical tables, compiled in the Sasanian Empire over a period of two centuries. Fragments of texts during this period show that Arab astronomers adopted the sine function from India in place of the chords of arc used in Greek trigonometry.[1]\nThe rise of Islam, with its obligation to determine the five daily prayer times and the qibla (the direction towards the Kaaba in the Sacred Mosque in Mecca) inspired intellectual progress in astronomy.[4]\nThe philosopher Al-Farabi (d. 950) described astronomy in terms of mathematics, music, and optics. He showed how astronomy could be used to describe the Earth's motion, and the position and movement of celestial bodies, and separated mathematical astronomy from science, restricting astronomy to describing the position, shape, and size of distant objects.[5] Al-Farabi used the writings of Ptolemy, as described in his Analemma, a way of calculating the Sun's position from any fixed location.[6]\nThe House of Wisdom was an academy established in Baghdad under Abbasid caliph Al-Ma'mun in the early 9th century. Astronomical research was greatly supported by al-Mamun through the House of Wisdom.[citation needed]\nThe first major Muslim work of astronomy was Zij al-Sindhind, produced by the mathematician Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi in 830.  It contained tables for the movements of the Sun, the Moon, and the planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. The work introduced Ptolemaic concepts into Islamic science, and marked a turning point in Islamic astronomy, which had previously concentrated on translating works, but which now began to develop new ideas.[7]\nIn 850, the Abbasid astronomer Al-Farghani wrote Kitab fi Jawami (\"A compendium of the science of stars\"). The book gave a summary of Ptolemic cosmography. However, it also corrected Ptolemy based on the findings of earlier Arab astronomers. Al-Farghani gave revised values for the obliquity of the ecliptic, the precession of the apogees of the Sun and the Moon, and the circumference of the Earth. The book was circulated through the Muslim world, and translated into Latin.[8]\nBy the 10th century, texts had appeared that doubted that Ptolemy's works were correct.[9] Islamic scholars questioned the Earth's apparent immobility,[10] and position at the centre of the universe.[11] now that independent investigations into the Ptolemaic system were possible.[12]\nThe 10th century Egyptian astronomer Ibn Yunus found errors in Ptolemy's calculations. Ptolemy calculated that the Earth's angle of axial precession varied by one degree every 100 years. Ibn Yunus calculated the rate of change to be one degree every 701\u20444 years.[citation needed]\nBetween 1025 and 1028, the polymath Ibn al-Haytham wrote his Al-Shukuk ala Batlamyus (\"Doubts on Ptolemy\"). While not disputing the existence of the geocentric model, he criticized elements of the Ptolemy's theories. Other astronomers took up the challenge posed in this work, and went on to develop alternate models that resolved the difficulties identified by Ibn al-Haytham. In 1070, Abu Ubayd al-Juzjani published the Tarik al-Aflak, in which he discussed the issues arising from Ptolemy's theory of equants, and proposed a solution. The anonymous work al-Istidrak ala Batlamyus (\"Recapitulation regarding Ptolemy\"), produced in Al-Andalus, included a list of objections to Ptolemic astronomy.[citation needed]\nNasir al-Din al-Tusi also exposed problems present in Ptolemy's work. In 1261, he published his Tadkhira, which contained 16 fundamental problems he found with Ptolemaic astronomy,[13] and by doing this, set off a chain of Islamic scholars that would attempt to solve these problems. Scholars such as Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi, Ibn al-Shatir, and Shams al-Din al-Khafri all worked to produce new models for solving Tusi's 16 Problems,[14] and the models they worked to create would become widely adopted by astronomers for use in their own works.\nNasir al-Din Tusi wanted to use the concept of Tusi couple to replace the \"equant\" concept in Ptolemic model. Since the equant concept would result in the moon distance to change dramatically through each month, at least by the factor of two if the math is done. But with the Tusi couple, the moon would just rotate around Earth resulting in the correct observation and applied concept.[15] Mu'ayyad al-Din al-Urdi was another engineer/scholar that tried to make sense of the motion of planets. He came up with the concept of lemma, which is a way of representing the epicyclical motion of planets without using Ptolemic method. Lemma was intended to replace the concept of equant as well.\nAbu Rayhan Biruni (b. 973) discussed the possibility of whether the Earth rotated about its own axis and around the Sun, but in his Masudic Canon, he set forth the principles that the Earth is at the center of the universe and that it has no motion of its own.[16] He was aware that if the Earth rotated on its axis, this would be consistent with his astronomical parameters,[17] but he considered this a problem of natural philosophy rather than mathematics.[18]\nHis contemporary, Abu Sa'id al-Sijzi, accepted that the Earth rotates around its axis.[19] Al-Biruni described an astrolabe invented by Sijzi based on the idea that the earth rotates.[20]\nThe fact that some people did believe that the earth is moving on its own axis is further confirmed by an Arabic reference work from the 13th century which states:\nAccording to the geometers [or engineers] (muhandis\u012bn), the earth is in a constant circular motion, and what appears to be the motion of the heavens is actually due to the motion of the earth and not the stars.[18]\nAt the Maragha and Samarkand observatories, the Earth's rotation was discussed by Najm al-Din al-Qazwini al-Katibi (d. 1277),[21] Tusi (b. 1201) and Qushji (b. 1403). The arguments and evidence used by Tusi and Qushji resemble those used by Copernicus to support the Earth's motion.[22][23] However, it remains a fact that the Maragha school never made the big leap to heliocentrism.[24]\nIn the 12th century, non-heliocentric alternatives to the Ptolemaic system were developed by some Islamic astronomers in al-Andalus, following a tradition established by Ibn Bajjah, Ibn Tufail, and Ibn Rushd.\nA notable example is Nur ad-Din al-Bitruji, who considered the Ptolemaic model mathematical, and not physical.[25] Al-Bitruji proposed a theory on planetary motion in which he wished to avoid both epicycles and eccentrics.[26] He was unsuccessful in replacing Ptolemy's planetary model, as the numerical predictions of the planetary positions in his configuration were less accurate than those of the Ptolemaic model.[27] One original aspects of al-Bitruji's system is his proposal of a physical cause of celestial motions. He contradicts the Aristotelian idea that there is a specific kind of dynamics for each world, applying instead the same dynamics to the sublunar and the celestial worlds.[28]\nIn the late 13th century, Nasir al-Din al-Tusi created the Tusi couple, as pictured above. Other notable astronomers from the later medieval period include Mu'ayyad al-Din al-Urdi (c. 1266), Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi (c. 1311), Sadr al-Sharia al-Bukhari (c. 1347), Ibn al-Shatir (c. 1375), and Ali Qushji (c. 1474).[29]\nIn the 15th century, the Timurid ruler Ulugh Beg of Samarkand established his court as a center of patronage for astronomy.  He studied it in his youth, and in 1420 ordered the construction of Ulugh Beg Observatory, which produced a new set of astronomical tables, as well as contributing to other scientific and mathematical advances.[30]\nSeveral major astronomical works were produced in the early 16th century, including ones by Al-Birjandi (d. 1525 or 1526) and Shams al-Din al-Khafri (fl. 1525). However, the vast majority of works written in this and later periods in the history of Islamic sciences are yet to be studied.[23]\nIslamic astronomy influenced Malian astronomy.[31]\nSeveral works of Islamic astronomy were translated to Latin starting from the 12th century.\nThe work of al-Battani (d. 929), Kit\u0101b az-Z\u012bj (\"Book of Astronomical Tables\"), was frequently cited by European astronomers and received several reprints, including one with annotations by Regiomontanus.[32] Copernicus, in his book that initiated the Copernican Revolution, the De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium, mentioned al-Battani no fewer than 23 times,[33] and also mentions him in the Commentariolus.[34] Tycho Brahe, Riccioli, Kepler, Galileo and others frequently cited him or his observations.[35] His data is still used in geophysics.[36]\nAround 1190, Al-Bitruji published an alternative geocentric system to Ptolemy's model. His system spread through most of Europe during the 13th century, with debates and refutations of his ideas continued to the 16th century.[25] In 1217, Michael Scot finished a Latin translation of al-Bitruji's Book of Cosmology (Kit\u0101b al-Hay\u02beah), which became a valid alternative to Ptolemy's Almagest in scholastic circles.[28] Several European writers, including Albertus Magnus and Roger Bacon, explained it in detail and compared it with Ptolemy's.[25] Copernicus cited his system in the De revolutionibus while discussing theories of the order of the inferior planets.[25][28]\nSome historians maintain that the thought of the Maragheh observatory, in particular the mathematical devices known as the Urdi lemma and the Tusi couple, influenced Renaissance-era European astronomy and thus Copernicus.[37][38][39][40] \nCopernicus used such devices in the same planetary models as found in Arabic sources.[41] \nFurthermore, the exact replacement of the equant by two epicycles used by Copernicus in the Commentariolus was found in an earlier work by Ibn al-Shatir (d. c. 1375) of Damascus.[42] Copernicus' lunar and Mercury models are also identical to Ibn al-Shatir's.[43]\nWhile the influence of the criticism of Ptolemy by Averroes on Renaissance thought is clear and explicit, the claim of direct influence of the Maragha school, postulated by Otto E. Neugebauer in 1957, remains an open question.[24][44][45] Since the Tusi couple was used by Copernicus in his reformulation of mathematical astronomy, there is a growing consensus that he became aware of this idea in some way.  It has been suggested[46][47] that the idea of the Tusi couple may have arrived in Europe leaving few manuscript traces, since it could have occurred without the translation of any Arabic text into Latin. One possible route of transmission may have been through Byzantine science, which translated some of al-Tusi's works from Arabic into Byzantine Greek. Several Byzantine Greek manuscripts containing the Tusi-couple are still extant in Italy.[48] Other scholars have argued that Copernicus could well have developed these ideas independently of the late Islamic tradition.[49] Copernicus explicitly references several astronomers of the \"Islamic Golden Age\" (10th to 12th centuries) in De Revolutionibus: Albategnius (Al-Battani), Averroes (Ibn Rushd), Thebit (Thabit Ibn Qurra), Arzachel (Al-Zarqali), and Alpetragius (Al-Bitruji), but he does not show awareness of the existence of any of the later astronomers of the Maragha school.[34]\nIt has been argued that Copernicus could have independently discovered the Tusi couple or took the idea from Proclus's Commentary on the First Book of Euclid,[50] which Copernicus cited.[51] \nAnother possible source for Copernicus's knowledge of this mathematical device is the Questiones de Spera of Nicole Oresme, who described how a reciprocating linear motion of a celestial body could be produced by a combination of circular motions similar to those proposed by al-Tusi.[52]\nIslamic influence on Chinese astronomy was first recorded during the Song dynasty when a Hui Muslim astronomer named Ma Yize introduced the concept of seven days in a week and made other contributions.[53]\nIslamic astronomers were brought to China in order to work on calendar making and astronomy during the Mongol Empire and the succeeding Yuan dynasty.[54] The Chinese scholar Yeh-lu Chu'tsai accompanied Genghis Khan to Persia in 1210 and studied their calendar for use in the Mongol Empire.[54] Kublai Khan brought Iranians to Beijing to construct an observatory and an institution for astronomical studies.[55]\nSeveral Chinese astronomers worked at the Maragheh observatory, founded by Nasir al-Din al-Tusi in 1259 under the patronage of Hulagu Khan in Persia.[56] One of these Chinese astronomers was Fu Mengchi, or Fu Mezhai.[57] In 1267, the Persian astronomer Jamal ad-Din, who previously worked at Maragha observatory, presented Kublai Khan with seven Persian astronomical instruments, including a terrestrial globe and an armillary sphere,[58] as well as an astronomical almanac, which was later known in China as the Wannian Li (\"Ten Thousand Year Calendar\" or \"Eternal Calendar\"). He was known as \"Zhamaluding\" in China, where, in 1271,[57] he was appointed by Khan as the first director of the Islamic observatory in Beijing,[56] known as the Islamic Astronomical Bureau, which operated alongside the Chinese Astronomical Bureau for four centuries. Islamic astronomy gained a good reputation in China for its theory of planetary latitudes, which did not exist in Chinese astronomy at the time, and for its accurate prediction of eclipses.[59]\nSome of the astronomical instruments constructed by the famous Chinese astronomer Guo Shoujing shortly afterwards resemble the style of instrumentation built at Maragheh.[56] In particular, the \"simplified instrument\" (jianyi) and the large gnomon at the Gaocheng Astronomical Observatory show traces of Islamic influence.[59] While formulating the Shoushili calendar in 1281, Shoujing's work in spherical trigonometry may have also been partially influenced by Islamic mathematics, which was largely accepted at Kublai's court.[60] These possible influences include a pseudo-geometrical method for converting between equatorial and ecliptic coordinates, the systematic use of decimals in the underlying parameters, and the application of cubic interpolation in the calculation of the irregularity in the planetary motions.[59]\nHongwu Emperor (r. 1368\u20131398) of the Ming dynasty (1328\u20131398), in the first year of his reign (1368), conscripted Han and non-Han astrology specialists from the astronomical institutions in Beijing of the former Mongolian Yuan to Nanjing to become officials of the newly established national observatory.\nThat year, the Ming government summoned for the first time the astronomical officials to come south from the upper capital of Yuan. There were fourteen of them. In order to enhance accuracy in methods of observation and computation, Hongwu Emperor reinforced the adoption of parallel calendar systems, the Han and the Hui. In the following years, the Ming Court appointed several Hui astrologers to hold high positions in the Imperial Observatory. They wrote many books on Islamic astronomy and also manufactured astronomical equipment based on the Islamic system.\nThe translation of two important works into Chinese was completed in 1383: Zij (1366) and al-Madkhal fi Sina'at Ahkam al-Nujum, Introduction to Astrology (1004).\nIn 1384, a Chinese astrolabe was made for observing stars based on the instructions for making multi-purposed Islamic equipment. In 1385, the apparatus was installed on a hill in northern Nanjing.\nAround 1384, during the Ming dynasty, Hongwu Emperor ordered the Chinese translation and compilation of Islamic astronomical tables, a task that was carried out by the scholars Mashayihei, a Muslim astronomer, and Wu Bozong, a Chinese scholar-official. These tables came to be known as the Huihui Lifa (Muslim System of Calendrical Astronomy), which was published in China a number of times until the early 18th century,[61] though the Qing dynasty had officially abandoned the tradition of Chinese-Islamic astronomy in 1659.[62] The Muslim astronomer Yang Guangxian was known for his attacks on the Jesuit's astronomical sciences.\nIn the early Joseon period, the Islamic calendar served as a basis for calendar reform being more accurate than the existing Chinese-based calendars.[63] A Korean translation of the Huihui Lifa, a text combining Chinese astronomy with Islamic astronomy works of Jamal ad-Din, was studied in Korea under the Joseon dynasty during the time of Sejong in the 15th century.[64]\nThe first systematic observations in Islam are reported to have taken place under the patronage of al-Mamun. Here, and in many other private observatories from Damascus to Baghdad, meridian degree measurement were performed (al-Ma'mun's arc measurement), solar parameters were established, and detailed observations of the Sun, Moon, and planets were undertaken.\nDuring the 10th century, the Buwayhid dynasty encouraged the undertaking of extensive works in astronomy; such as the construction of a large-scale instruments with which observations were made in the year 950. This is known through recordings made in the zij of astronomers such as Ibn al-A'lam. The great astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi was patronised by prince 'Adud al-Dawla, who systematically revised Ptolemy's catalogue of stars. Sharaf al-Dawla also established a similar observatory in Baghdad. Reports by Ibn Yunus and al-Zarqali in Toledo and Cordoba indicate the use of sophisticated instruments for their time.\nIt was Malik Shah I who established the first large observatory, probably in Isfahan. It was here where Omar Khayy\u00e1m with many other collaborators constructed a zij and formulated the Persian Solar Calendar a.k.a. the jalali calendar. A modern version of this calendar, the Solar Hijri calendar, is still in official use in Iran and Afghanistan today.\nThe most influential observatory was however founded by Hulegu Khan during the 13th century. Here, Nasir al-Din al-Tusi supervised its technical construction at Maragha. The facility contained resting quarters for Hulagu Khan, as well as a library and mosque. Some of the top astronomers of the day gathered there, and from their collaboration resulted important modifications to the Ptolemaic system over a period of 50 years.\nIn 1420, prince Ulugh Beg, himself an astronomer and mathematician, founded another large observatory in Samarkand, the remains of which were excavated in 1908 by Russian teams.\nAnd finally, Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf founded a large observatory in Ottoman Constantinople in 1577, which was on the same scale as those in Maragha and Samarkand. The observatory was short-lived however, as opponents of the observatory and prognostication from the heavens prevailed and the observatory was destroyed in 1580.[65] While the Ottoman clergy did not object to the science of astronomy, the observatory was primarily being used for astrology, which they did oppose, and successfully sought its destruction.[66]\nAs observatory development continued, Islamicate scientists began to pioneer the planetarium. The major difference between a planetarium and an observatory is how the universe is projected. In an observatory, you must look up into the night sky, on the other hand, planetariums allow for universes planets and stars to project at eye-level in a room. Scientist Ibn Firnas, created a planetarium in his home that included artificial storm noises and was completely made of glass. Being the first of its kind, it very similar to what we see\u00a0 for planetariums today.\nOur knowledge of the instruments used by Muslim astronomers primarily comes from two sources: first the remaining instruments in private and museum collections today, and second the treatises and manuscripts preserved from the Middle Ages.\nMuslim astronomers of the \"Golden Period\" made many improvements to instruments already in use before their time, such as adding new scales or details.\nCelestial globes were used primarily for solving problems in celestial astronomy. Today, 126 such instruments remain worldwide, the oldest from the 11th century. The altitude of the Sun, or the Right Ascension and Declination of stars could be calculated with these by inputting the location of the observer on the  meridian ring of the globe.[67] The initial blueprint for a portable celestial globe to measure celestial coordinates came from Spanish Muslim astronomer Jabir ibn Aflah (d. 1145). Another skillful Muslim astronomer working on celestial globes was Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi (b. 903), whose treatise the Book of Fixed Stars describes how to design the constellation images on the globe, as well as how to use the celestial globe. However, it was in Iraq in the 10th century that astronomer Al-Battani was working on celestial globes to record celestial data. This was different because up until then, the traditional use for a celestial globe was as an observational instrument. Al-Battani's treatise describes in detail the plotting coordinates for 1,022 stars, as well as how the stars should be marked. An armillary sphere had similar applications. No early Islamic armillary spheres survive, but several treatises on \"the instrument with the rings\" were written. In this context there is also an Islamic development, the spherical astrolabe, of which only one complete instrument, from the 14th century, has survived.\nBrass astrolabes were an invention of Late Antiquity. The first Islamic astronomer reported as having built an astrolabe is Muhammad al-Fazari (late 8th century).[68]  Astrolabes were popular in the Islamic world during the \"Golden Age\", chiefly as an aid to finding the qibla. The earliest known example is dated to 927/8 (AH 315).[69]\nThe device was incredibly useful, and sometime during the 10th century it was brought to Europe from the Muslim world, where it inspired Latin scholars to take up a vested interest in both math and astronomy.[70] Despite how much we know much about the tool, many of the functions of the device have become lost to history. Although it is true that there are many surviving instruction manuals, historians have come to the conclusion that there are more functions of specialized astrolabes that we do not know of.[71] One example of this is an astrolabe created by Nasir al-Din al-Tusi in Aleppo in the year 1328/29 C.E. This particular astrolabe was special and is hailed by historians as the \"most sophisticated astrolabe ever made\",[71] being known to have five distinct universal uses.\nThe largest function of the astrolabe is it serves as a portable model of space that can calculate the approximate location of any heavenly body found within the solar system at any point in time, provided the latitude of the observer is accounted for. In order to adjust for latitude, astrolabes often had a second plate on top of the first, which the user could swap out to account for their correct latitude.[70] One of the most useful features of the device is that the projection created allows users to calculate and solve mathematical problems graphically which could otherwise be done only by using complex spherical trigonometry, allowing for earlier access to great mathematical feats.[72] In addition to this, use of the astrolabe allowed for ships at sea to calculate their position given that the device is fixed upon a star with a known altitude. Standard astrolabes performed poorly on the ocean, as bumpy waters and aggressive winds made use difficult, so a new iteration of the device, known as a Mariner's astrolabe, was developed to counteract the difficult conditions of the sea.[73]\nThe instruments were used to read the time of the Sun rising and fixed stars. al-Zarqali of Andalusia constructed one such instrument in which, unlike its predecessors, did not depend on the latitude of the observer, and could be used anywhere. This instrument became known in Europe as the Saphea.[74]\nThe astrolabe was arguably the most important instrument created and used for astronomical purposes in the medieval period. Its invention in early medieval times required immense study and much trial and error in order to find the right method of which to construct it to where it would work efficiently and consistently, and its invention led to several mathematic advances which came from the problems that arose from using the instrument.[75] The astrolabe's original purpose was to allow one to find the altitudes of the sun and many visible stars, during the day and night, respectively.[76] However, they have ultimately come to provide great contribution to the progress of mapping the globe, thus resulting in further exploration of the sea, which then resulted in a series of positive events that allowed the world we know today to come to be.[77] The astrolabe has served many purposes over time, and it has shown to be quite a key factor from medieval times to the present.\nThe astrolabe required the use of mathematics, and the development of the instrument incorporated azimuth circles, which opened a series of questions on further mathematical dilemmas.[75] Astrolabes served the purpose of finding the altitude of the sun, which also meant that they provided one the ability to find the direction of Muslim prayer (or the direction of Mecca).[75] Aside from these purposes, the astrolabe had a great influence on navigation, specifically in the marine world. This advancement made the calculation of latitude simpler, which led to an increase in sea exploration, and indirectly led to the Renaissance revolution, an increase in global trade activity, and ultimately the discovery of several of the world's continents.[77]\nAbu Rayhan Biruni designed an instrument he called \"Box of the Moon\", which was a mechanical lunisolar calendar, employing a gear train and eight gear-wheels.[78] This was an early example of a fixed-wired knowledge processing machine.[79] This work of Al Biruni uses the same gear trains preserved in a 6th century Byzantine portable sundial.[80]\nMuslims made several important improvements[which?] to the theory and construction of sundials, which they inherited from their Indian and Greek predecessors. Khwarizmi made tables for these instruments which considerably shortened the time needed to make specific calculations.\nSundials were frequently placed on mosques to determine the time of prayer.  One of the most striking examples was built in the 14th century by the muwaqqit (timekeeper) of the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus, ibn al-Shatir.[82]\nSeveral forms of quadrants were invented by Muslims. Among them was the sine quadrant used for astronomical calculations, and various forms of the horary quadrant used to determine the time (especially the times of prayer) by observations of the Sun or stars. A center of the development of quadrants was 9th century Baghdad.[83] Abu Bakr ibn al-Sarah al-Hamawi (d. 1329) was a Syrian astronomer that invented a quadrant called \u201cal-muqantarat al-yusra\u201d. He devoted his time to writing several books on his accomplishments and advancements with quadrants and geometrical problems. His works on quadrants include Treatise on Operations with the Hidden Quadrant and Rare Pearls on Operations with the Circle for Finding Sines. These instruments could measure the altitude between a celestial object and the horizon. However, as Muslim astronomers used them, they began to find other ways to use them. For example, the mural quadrant, for recording the angles of planets and celestial bodies. Or the universal quadrant, for latitude solving astronomical problems. The horary quadrant, for finding the time of day with the sun. The almucantar quadrant, which was developed from the astrolabe.\nPlanetary equatoria were probably made by ancient Greeks, although no findings nor descriptions have been preserved from that period. In his comment on Ptolemy's Handy Tables, 4th century mathematician Theon of Alexandria introduced some diagrams to geometrically compute the position of the planets based on Ptolemy's epicyclical theory. The first description of the construction of a solar (as opposed to planetary) equatorium is contained in Proclus's 5th century work Hypotyposis,[84] where he gives instructions on how to construct one in wood or bronze.[85]\nThe earliest known description of a planetary equatorial is contained in early 11th century treatise by Ibn al-Samh, preserved only as a 13th century Castillian translation contained in the Libros del saber de astronomia (Books of the knowledge of astronomy); the same book contains also a 1080/1081 treatise on the equatorial by Al-Zarqali.[85]\nExamples of cosmological imagery in Islamic art can be found in objects such as manuscripts, astrological tools, and palace frescoes, and the study of the heavens by Islamic astronomers has translated into artistic representations of the universe and astrological concepts.[86] The Islamic world gleaned inspiration from Greek, Iranian, and Indian traditions to represent the stars and the universe.[87]\nThe desert castle at Qasr Amra, which was used as a Umayyad palace, has a bath dome decorated with the Islamic zodiac and other celestial designs.[88]   The Brethren of Purity described the Sun as being placed at the centre of the universe by God, with the other celestial bodies orbiting around it.[86]\nThe Islamic zodiac and astrological visuals can be seen in examples of metalwork. Ewers depicting the twelve zodiac symbols exist in order to emphasize elite craftsmanship and carry blessings such as one example now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.[89] Coinage also carried zodiac imagery that bears the sole purpose of representing the month in which the coin was minted.[90] As a result, astrological symbols could have been used as both decoration, and a means to communicate symbolic meanings or specific information.\nData from Hill (1993), Islamic Science And Engineering.[91]", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy_in_the_medieval_Islamic_world", "
