It is the second-most populous country in Europe after Russia, and the most populous member state of the European Union. Germany is situated between the Baltic and North seas to the north, and the Alps to the south. Its 16 constituent states are bordered by Denmark to the north, Poland and the Czech Republic to the east, Austria and Switzerland to the south, and France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands to the west. The nation's capital and most populous city is Berlin and its main financial centre is Frankfurt; the largest urban area is the Ruhr.\nVarious Germanic tribes have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since classical antiquity. A region named Germania was documented before AD 100. In 962, the Kingdom of Germany formed the bulk of the Holy Roman Empire. During the 16th century, northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation. Following the Napoleonic Wars and the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the German Confederation was formed in 1815.\nFormal unification of Germany into the modern nation-state was commenced on 18 August 1866 with the North German Confederation Treaty establishing the Prussia-led North German Confederation later transformed in 1871 into the German Empire. After World War I and the German Revolution of 1918\u20131919, the Empire was in turn transformed into the semi-presidential Weimar Republic. The Nazi seizure of power in 1933 led to the establishment of a totalitarian dictatorship, World War II, and the Holocaust. After the end of World War II in Europe and a period of Allied occupation, in 1949, Germany as a whole was organized into two separate polities with limited sovereignty: the Federal Republic of Germany, generally known as West Germany, and the German Democratic Republic, East Germany, while Berlin de jure continued its Four Power status. The Federal Republic of Germany was a founding member of the European Economic Community and the European Union, while the German Democratic Republic was a communist Eastern Bloc state and member of the Warsaw Pact. After the fall of communist led-government in East Germany, German reunification saw the former East German states join the Federal Republic of Germany on 3 October 1990\u2014becoming a federal parliamentary republic.\nGermany has been described as a great power with a strong economy; it has the largest economy in Europe, the world's fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP and the fifth-largest by PPP. As a global power in industrial, scientific and technological sectors, it is both the world's third-largest exporter and importer. As a developed country it offers social security, a universal health care system and a tuition-free university education. Germany is a member of the United Nations, the European Union, NATO, the Council of Europe, the G7, the G20 and the OECD. It has the third-greatest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\nThe English word Germany derives from the Latin Germania, which came into use after Julius Caesar adopted it for the peoples east of the Rhine.[12] The German term Deutschland, originally diutisciu land ('the German lands') is derived from deutsch (cf. Dutch), descended from Old High German diutisc 'of the people' (from diot or diota 'people'), originally used to distinguish the language of the common people from Latin and its Romance descendants. This in turn descends from Proto-Germanic *\u00feiudiskaz 'of the people' (see also the Latinised form Theodiscus), derived from *\u00feeud\u014d, descended from Proto-Indo-European *tewt\u00e9h\u2082- 'people', from which the word Teutons also originates.[13]\nPre-human ancestors, the Danuvius guggenmosi, who were present in Germany over 11 million years ago, are theorized to be among the earliest ones to walk on two legs.[14] Ancient humans were present in Germany at least 600,000 years ago.[15] The first non-modern human fossil (the Neanderthal) was discovered in the Neander Valley.[16] Similarly dated evidence of modern humans has been found in the Swabian Jura, including 42,000-year-old flutes which are the oldest musical instruments ever found,[17] the 40,000-year-old Lion Man,[18] and the 35,000-year-old Venus of Hohle Fels.[19] The Nebra sky disk, created during the European Bronze Age, has been attributed to a German site.[20]\nThe Germanic peoples are thought to date from the Nordic Bronze Age, early Iron Age, or the Jastorf culture.[21][22] From southern Scandinavia and northern Germany, they expanded south, east, and west, coming into contact with the Celtic, Iranian, Baltic, and Slavic tribes.[23]\nUnder Augustus, the Roman Empire began to invade lands inhabited by the Germanic tribes, creating a short-lived Roman province of Germania between the Rhine and Elbe rivers. In 9\u00a0AD, three Roman legions were defeated by Arminius.[24] By 100\u00a0AD, when Tacitus wrote Germania, Germanic tribes had settled along the Rhine and the Danube (the Limes Germanicus), occupying most of modern Germany. However, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, southern Bavaria, southern Hesse and the western Rhineland had been incorporated into Roman provinces.[25][26][27] Around 260, Germanic peoples broke into Roman-controlled lands.[28] After the invasion of the Huns in 375, and with the decline of Rome from 395, Germanic tribes moved farther southwest: the Franks established the Frankish Kingdom and pushed east to subjugate Saxony and Bavaria, and areas of what is today eastern Germany were inhabited by Western Slavic tribes.[25]\nCharlemagne founded the Carolingian Empire in 800; it was divided in 843.[29] The eastern successor kingdom of East Francia stretched from the Rhine in the west to the Elbe river in the east and from the North Sea to the Alps.[29] Subsequently, the Holy Roman Empire emerged from it. The Ottonian rulers (919\u20131024) consolidated several major duchies.[30] In 996, Gregory V became the first German Pope, appointed by his cousin Otto III, whom he shortly after crowned Holy Roman Emperor. The Holy Roman Empire absorbed northern Italy and Burgundy under the Salian emperors (1024\u20131125), although the emperors lost power through the Investiture Controversy.[31]\nUnder the Hohenstaufen emperors (1138\u20131254), German princes encouraged German settlement to the south and east (Ostsiedlung).[32] Members of the Hanseatic League, mostly north German towns, prospered in the expansion of trade.[33] The population declined starting with the Great Famine in 1315, followed by the Black Death of 1348\u201350.[34] The Golden Bull issued in 1356 provided the constitutional structure of the Empire and codified the election of the emperor by seven prince-electors.[35]\nJohannes Gutenberg introduced moveable-type printing to Europe, laying the basis for the democratization of knowledge.[36] In 1517, Martin Luther incited the Protestant Reformation and his translation of the Bible began the standardization of the language; the 1555 Peace of Augsburg tolerated the \"Evangelical\" faith (Lutheranism), but also decreed that the faith of the prince was to be the faith of his subjects (cuius regio, eius religio).[37] From the Cologne War through the Thirty Years' Wars (1618\u20131648), religious conflict devastated German lands and significantly reduced the population.[38][39]\nThe Peace of Westphalia ended religious warfare among the Imperial Estates;[38] their mostly German-speaking rulers were able to choose Roman Catholicism, Lutheranism, or the Reformed faith as their official religion.[40] The legal system initiated by a series of Imperial Reforms (approximately 1495\u20131555) provided for considerable local autonomy and a stronger Imperial Diet.[41] The House of Habsburg held the imperial crown from 1438 until the death of Charles VI in 1740. Following the War of the Austrian Succession and the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, Charles VI's daughter Maria Theresa ruled as empress consort when her husband, Francis I, became emperor.[42][43]\nFrom 1740, dualism between the Austrian Habsburg monarchy and the Kingdom of Prussia dominated German history. In 1772, 1793, and 1795, Prussia and Austria, along with the Russian Empire, agreed to the Partitions of Poland.[44][45] During the period of the French Revolutionary Wars, the Napoleonic era and the subsequent final meeting of the Imperial Diet, most of the Free Imperial Cities were annexed by dynastic territories; the ecclesiastical territories were secularised and annexed. In 1806 the Imperium was dissolved; France, Russia, Prussia and the Habsburgs (Austria) competed for hegemony in the German states during the Napoleonic Wars.[46]\nFollowing the fall of Napoleon, the Congress of Vienna founded the German Confederation, a loose league of 39 sovereign states. The appointment of the emperor of Austria as the permanent president reflected the Congress's rejection of Prussia's rising influence. Disagreement within restoration politics partly led to the rise of liberal movements, followed by new measures of repression by Austrian statesman Klemens von Metternich.[47][48] The Zollverein, a tariff union, furthered economic unity.[49] In light of revolutionary movements in Europe, intellectuals and commoners started the revolutions of 1848 in the German states, raising the German question. King Frederick William IV of Prussia was offered the title of emperor, but with a loss of power; he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution, a temporary setback for the movement.[50]\nKing William I appointed Otto von Bismarck as the minister president of Prussia in 1862. Bismarck successfully concluded the war with Denmark in 1864; the subsequent decisive Prussian victory in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 enabled him to create the North German Confederation which excluded Austria. After the defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War, the German princes proclaimed the founding of the German Empire in 1871. Prussia was the dominant constituent state of the new empire; the King of Prussia ruled as its Kaiser, and Berlin became its capital.[51][52]\nIn the Gr\u00fcnderzeit period following the unification of Germany, Bismarck's foreign policy as chancellor of Germany secured Germany's position as a great nation by forging alliances and avoiding war.[52] However, under Wilhelm II, Germany took an imperialistic course, leading to friction with neighbouring countries.[53] A dual alliance was created with the multinational realm of Austria-Hungary; the Triple Alliance of 1882 included Italy. Britain, France and Russia also concluded alliances to protect against Habsburg interference with Russian interests in the Balkans or German interference against France.[54] At the Berlin Conference in 1884, Germany claimed several colonies including German East Africa, German South West Africa, Togoland, and Kamerun.[55] Later, Germany further expanded its colonial empire to include holdings in the Pacific and China.[56] The colonial government in South West Africa (present-day Namibia), from 1904 to 1907, carried out the annihilation of the local Herero and Namaqua peoples as punishment for an uprising;[57][58] this was the 20th century's first genocide.[58]\nThe assassination of Austria's crown prince on 28 June 1914 provided the pretext for Austria-Hungary to attack Serbia and trigger World War I. After four years of warfare, in which approximately two million German soldiers were killed,[59] a general armistice ended the fighting. In the German Revolution (November 1918), Emperor Wilhelm II and the ruling princes abdicated their positions, and Germany was declared a federal republic. Germany's new leadership signed the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, accepting defeat by the Allies. Germans perceived the treaty as humiliating, which was seen by historians as influential in the rise of Adolf Hitler.[60] Germany lost around 13% of its European territory and ceded all of its colonial possessions in Africa and the Pacific.[61]\nOn 11 August 1919, President Friedrich Ebert signed the democratic Weimar Constitution.[62] In the subsequent struggle for power, communists seized power in Bavaria, but conservative elements elsewhere attempted to overthrow the Republic in the Kapp Putschcode: deu promoted to code: de . Street fighting in the major industrial centres, the occupation of the Ruhr by Belgian and French troops, and a period of hyperinflation followed. A debt restructuring plan and the creation of a new currency in 1924 ushered in the Golden Twenties, an era of artistic innovation and liberal cultural life.[63][64][65]\nThe worldwide Great Depression hit Germany in 1929. Chancellor Heinrich Br\u00fcning's government pursued a policy of fiscal austerity and deflation which caused unemployment of nearly 30% by 1932.[66] The Nazi Party led by Adolf Hitler became the largest party in the Reichstag after a special election in 1932 and Hindenburg appointed Hitler as chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933.[67] After the Reichstag fire, a decree abrogated basic civil rights and the first Nazi concentration camp opened.[68][69] On 23 March 1933, the Enabling Act gave Hitler unrestricted legislative power, overriding the constitution,[70] and marked the beginning of Nazi Germany. His government established a centralised totalitarian state, withdrew from the League of Nations, and dramatically increased the country's rearmament.[71] A government-sponsored programme for economic renewal focused on public works, the most famous of which was the Autobahncode: deu promoted to code: de .[72]\nIn 1935, the regime withdrew from the Treaty of Versailles and introduced the Nuremberg Laws which targeted Jews and other minorities.[73] Germany also reacquired control of the Saarland in 1935,[74] remilitarised the Rhineland in 1936, annexed Austria in 1938, annexed the Sudetenland in 1938 with the Munich Agreement, and in violation of the agreement occupied Czechoslovakia in March 1939.[75] Kristallnacht (Night of Broken Glass) saw the burning of synagogues, the destruction of Jewish businesses, and mass arrests of Jewish people.[76]\nIn August 1939, Hitler's government negotiated the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact that divided Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence.[77] On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland, beginning World War II in Europe;[78] Britain and France declared war on Germany on 3 September.[79] In the spring of 1940, Germany conquered Denmark and Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France, forcing the French government to sign an armistice. The British repelled German air attacks in the Battle of Britain in the same year. In 1941, German troops invaded Yugoslavia, Greece and the Soviet Union. By 1942, Germany and its allies controlled most of continental Europe and North Africa, but following the Soviet victory at the Battle of Stalingrad, the Allied reconquest of North Africa and invasion of Italy in 1943, German forces suffered repeated military defeats. In 1944, the Soviets pushed into Eastern Europe; the Western allies landed in France and entered Germany despite a final German counteroffensive. Following Hitler's suicide during the Battle of Berlin, Germany signed the surrender document on 8 May 1945, ending World War II in Europe[78][80] and Nazi Germany. Following the end of the war, surviving Nazi officials were tried for war crimes at the Nuremberg trials.[81][82]\nIn what later became known as the Holocaust, the German government persecuted minorities, including interning them in concentration and death camps across Europe. In total 17 million people were systematically murdered, including 6\u00a0million Jews, at least 130,000 Romani, 275,000 disabled people, thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses, thousands of homosexuals, and hundreds of thousands of political and religious opponents.[83] Nazi policies in German-occupied countries resulted in the deaths of an estimated 2.7\u00a0million Poles,[84] 1.3\u00a0million Ukrainians, 1\u00a0million Belarusians and 3.5\u00a0million Soviet prisoners of war.[85][81] German military casualties have been estimated at 5.3\u00a0million,[86] and around 900,000 German civilians died.[87] Around 12\u00a0million ethnic Germans were expelled from across Eastern Europe, and Germany lost roughly one-quarter of its pre-war territory.[88]\nAfter Nazi Germany surrendered, the Allies partitioned Berlin and Germany's remaining territory into four occupation zones. The western sectors, controlled by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, were merged on 23 May 1949 to form the Federal Republic of Germany (German: Bundesrepublik Deutschland); on 7 October 1949, the Soviet Zone became the German Democratic Republic (GDR) (German: Deutsche Demokratische Republik; DDR). They were informally known as West Germany and East Germany.[90] East Germany selected East Berlin as its capital, while West Germany chose Bonn as a provisional capital, to emphasise its stance that the two-state solution was temporary.[91]\nWest Germany was established as a federal parliamentary republic with a \"social market economy\". Starting in 1948 West Germany became a major recipient of reconstruction aid under the American Marshall Plan.[92] Konrad Adenauer was elected the first federal chancellor of Germany in 1949. The country enjoyed prolonged economic growth (Wirtschaftswunder) beginning in the early 1950s.[93] West Germany joined NATO in 1955 and was a founding member of the European Economic Community.[94]\nEast Germany was an Eastern Bloc state under political and military control by the Soviet Union via occupation forces and the Warsaw Pact. Although East Germany claimed to be a democracy, political power was exercised solely by leading members (Politb\u00fcro) of the communist-controlled Socialist Unity Party of Germany, supported by the Stasicode: deu promoted to code: de , an immense secret service.[95] While East German propaganda was based on the benefits of the GDR's social programmes and the alleged threat of a West German invasion, many of its citizens looked to the West for freedom and prosperity.[96] The Berlin Wall, built in 1961, prevented East German citizens from escaping to West Germany, becoming a symbol of the Cold War.[97]\nTensions between East and West Germany were reduced in the late 1960s by Chancellor Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik.[98] In 1989, Hungary decided to dismantle the Iron Curtain and open its border with Austria, causing the emigration of thousands of East Germans to West Germany via Hungary and Austria. This had devastating effects on the GDR, where regular mass demonstrations received increasing support. In an effort to help retain East Germany as a state, the East German authorities eased border restrictions, but this actually led to an acceleration of the Wende reform process culminating in the Two Plus Four Treaty under which Germany regained full sovereignty. This permitted German reunification on 3 October 1990, with the accession of the five re-established states of the former GDR.[99] The fall of the Wall in 1989 became a symbol of the Fall of Communism, the Dissolution of the Soviet Union, German reunification and Die Wende.[100]\nUnited Germany was considered the enlarged continuation of West Germany so it retained its memberships in international organisations.[101] Based on the Berlin/Bonn Act (1994), Berlin again became the capital of Germany, while Bonn obtained the unique status of a Bundesstadt (federal city) retaining some federal ministries.[102] The relocation of the government was completed in 1999, and modernisation of the East German economy was scheduled to last until 2019.[103][104]\nSince reunification, Germany has taken a more active role in the European Union, signing the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 and the Lisbon Treaty in 2007,[105] and co-founding the Eurozone.[106] Germany sent a peacekeeping force to secure stability in the Balkans and sent German troops to Afghanistan as part of a NATO effort to provide security in that country after the ousting of the Taliban.[107][108]\nIn the 2005 elections, Angela Merkel became the first female chancellor. In 2009 the German government approved a \u20ac50\u00a0billion stimulus plan.[109] Among the major German political projects of the early 21st century are the advancement of European integration, the energy transition (Energiewende) for a sustainable energy supply, the debt brake for balanced budgets, measures to increase the fertility rate (pronatalism), and high-tech strategies for the transition of the German economy, summarised as Industry 4.0.[110] During the 2015 European migrant crisis, the country took in over a million refugees and migrants.[111]\nGermany is the seventh-largest country in Europe;[4] bordering Denmark to the north, Poland and the Czech Republic to the east, Austria to the southeast, and Switzerland to the south-southwest. France, Luxembourg and Belgium are situated to the west, with the Netherlands to the northwest. Germany is also bordered by the North Sea and, at the north-northeast, by the Baltic Sea. German territory covers 357,022\u00a0km2 (137,847\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), consisting of 348,672\u00a0km2 (134,623\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of land and 8,350\u00a0km2 (3,224\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of water.\nElevation ranges from the mountains of the Alps (highest point: the Zugspitze at 2,963 metres or 9,721 feet) in the south to the shores of the North Sea (Nordsee) in the northwest and the Baltic Sea (Ostsee) in the northeast. The forested uplands of central Germany and the lowlands of northern Germany (lowest point: in the municipality Neuendorf-Sachsenbande, Wilstermarsch at 3.54 metres or 11.6 feet below sea level[112]) are traversed by such major rivers as the Rhine, Danube and Elbe. Significant natural resources include iron ore, coal, potash, timber, lignite, uranium, copper, natural gas, salt, and nickel.[4]\nMost of Germany has a temperate climate, ranging from oceanic in the north and west to continental in the east and southeast. Winters range from the cold in the Southern Alps to cool and are generally overcast with limited precipitation, while summers can vary from hot and dry to cool and rainy. The northern regions have prevailing westerly winds that bring in moist air from the North Sea, moderating the temperature and increasing precipitation. Conversely, the southeast regions have more extreme temperatures.[113]\nFrom February 2019\u20132020, average monthly temperatures in Germany ranged from a low of 3.3\u00a0\u00b0C (37.9\u00a0\u00b0F) in January 2020 to a high of 19.8\u00a0\u00b0C (67.6\u00a0\u00b0F) in June 2019.[114] Average monthly precipitation ranged from 30 litres per square metre in February and April 2019 to 125 litres per square metre in February 2020.[115] Average monthly hours of sunshine ranged from 45 in November 2019 to 300 in June 2019.[116]\nThe territory of Germany can be divided into five terrestrial ecoregions: Atlantic mixed forests, Baltic mixed forests, Central European mixed forests, Western European broadleaf forests, and Alps conifer and mixed forests.[117] As of 2016[update] 51% of Germany's land area is devoted to agriculture, while 30% is forested and 14% is covered by settlements or infrastructure.[118]\nPlants and animals include those generally common to Central Europe. According to the National Forest Inventory, beeches, oaks, and other deciduous trees constitute just over 40% of the forests; roughly 60% are conifers, particularly spruce and pine.[119] There are many species of ferns, flowers, fungi, and mosses. Wild animals include roe deer, wild boar, mouflon (a subspecies of wild sheep), fox, badger, hare, and small numbers of the Eurasian beaver.[120] The blue cornflower was once a German national symbol.[121]\nThe 16 national parks in Germany include the Jasmund National Park, the Vorpommern Lagoon Area National Park, the M\u00fcritz National Park, the Wadden Sea National Parks, the Harz National Park, the Hainich National Park, the Black Forest National Park, the Saxon Switzerland National Park, the Bavarian Forest National Park and the Berchtesgaden National Park.[122] In addition, there are 17 Biosphere Reserves,[123] and 105 nature parks.[124] More than 400 zoos and animal parks operate in Germany.[125] The Berlin Zoo, which opened in 1844, is the oldest in Germany, and claims the most comprehensive collection of species in the world.[126]\nGermany is a federal, parliamentary, representative democratic republic. Federal legislative power is vested in the parliament consisting of the Bundestag (Federal Diet) and Bundesrat (Federal Council), which together form the legislative body. The Bundestag is elected through direct elections using the mixed-member proportional representation system. The members of the Bundesrat represent and are appointed by the governments of the sixteen federated states.[4] The German political system operates under a framework laid out in the 1949 constitution known as the Grundgesetz (Basic Law). Amendments generally require a two-thirds majority of both the Bundestag and the Bundesrat; the fundamental principles of the constitution, as expressed in the articles guaranteeing human dignity, the separation of powers, the federal structure, and the rule of law, are valid in perpetuity.[127]\nThe president, currently Frank-Walter Steinmeier, is the head of state and invested primarily with representative responsibilities and powers. He is elected by the Bundesversammlung (federal convention), an institution consisting of the members of the Bundestag and an equal number of state delegates.[4] The second-highest official in the German order of precedence is the Bundestagspr\u00e4sident (President of the Bundestag), who is elected by the Bundestag and responsible for overseeing the daily sessions of the body.[128] The third-highest official and the head of government is the chancellor, who is appointed by the Bundespr\u00e4sident after being elected by the party or coalition with the most seats in the Bundestag.[4] The chancellor, currently Olaf Scholz, is the head of government and exercises executive power through his Cabinet.[4]\nSince 1949, the party system has been dominated by the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party of Germany. So far every chancellor has been a member of one of these parties. However, the smaller liberal Free Democratic Party and the Alliance 90/The Greens have also been junior partners in coalition governments. Since 2007, the democratic socialist party The Left has been a staple in the German Bundestag, though they have never been part of the federal government. In the 2017 German federal election, the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany gained enough votes to attain representation in the parliament for the first time.[129][130]\nGermany is a federation and comprises sixteen constituent states which are collectively referred to as L\u00e4nder.[131] Each state (Land) has its own constitution,[132] and is largely autonomous in regard to its internal organisation.[131] As of 2017[update] Germany is divided into 401 districts (Kreise) at a municipal level; these consist of 294 rural districts and 107 urban districts.[133]\nGermany has a civil law system based on Roman law with some references to Germanic law.[137] The Bundesverfassungsgericht (Federal Constitutional Court) is the German Supreme Court responsible for constitutional matters, with power of judicial review.[138] Germany's supreme court system is specialised: for civil and criminal cases, the highest court of appeal is the inquisitorial Federal Court of Justice, and for other affairs the courts are the Federal Labour Court, the Federal Social Court, the Federal Fiscal Court and the Federal Administrative Court.[139]\nCriminal and private laws are codified on the national level in the Strafgesetzbuch and the B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch respectively. The German penal system seeks the rehabilitation of the criminal and the protection of the public.[140] Except for petty crimes, which are tried before a single professional judge, and serious political crimes, all charges are tried before mixed tribunals on which lay judges (Sch\u00f6ffen) sit side by side with professional judges.[141][142]\nGermany has a low murder rate with 1.18 murders per 100,000 as of 2016[update].[143] In 2018, the overall crime rate fell to its lowest since 1992.[144]\nGermany has a network of 227 diplomatic missions abroad[145] and maintains relations with more than 190 countries.[146] Germany is a member of NATO, the OECD, the G7, the G20, the World Bank and the IMF. It has played an influential role in the European Union since its inception and has maintained a strong alliance with France and all neighbouring countries since 1990. Germany promotes the creation of a more unified European political, economic and security apparatus.[147][148][149] The governments of Germany and the United States are close political allies.[150] Cultural ties and economic interests have crafted a bond between the two countries resulting in Atlanticism.[151] After 1990, Germany and Russia worked together to establish a \"strategic partnership\" in which energy development became one of the most important factors. As a result of the cooperation, Germany imported most of its natural gas and crude oil from Russia.[152][153]\nThe development policy of Germany is an independent area of foreign policy. It is formulated by the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development and carried out by the implementing organisations. The German government sees development policy as a joint responsibility of the international community.[154] It was the world's second-biggest aid donor in 2019 after the United States.[155]\nGermany's military, the Bundeswehr (Federal Defence), is organised into the Heer (Army and special forces KSK), Marine (Navy), Luftwaffe (Air Force), Zentraler Sanit\u00e4tsdienst der Bundeswehr (Joint Medical Service), Streitkr\u00e4ftebasis (Joint Support Service) and Cyber- und Informationsraum (Cyber and Information Domain Service) branches. In absolute terms, German military expenditure is the eighth-highest in the world.[156] In 2018, military spending was at $49.5\u00a0billion, about 1.2% of the country's GDP, well below the NATO target of 2%.[157][158] However, in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced that German military expenditure would be increased past the NATO target of 2%, along with a one-time 2022 infusion of 100 billion euros, representing almost double the 53 billion euro military budget for 2021.[159][160]\nAs of January\u00a02020[update], the Bundeswehr has a strength of 184,001 active soldiers and 80,947 civilians.[161] Reservists are available to the armed forces and participate in defence exercises and deployments abroad.[162] Until 2011, military service was compulsory for men at age 18, but this has been officially suspended and replaced with a voluntary service.[163][164] Since 2001 women may serve in all functions of service without restriction.[165] According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Germany was the fourth-largest exporter of major arms in the world from 2014 to 2018.[166]\nIn peacetime, the Bundeswehr is commanded by the Minister of Defence. In state of defence, the Chancellor would become commander-in-chief of the Bundeswehr.[167] The role of the Bundeswehr is described in the Constitution of Germany as defensive only. But after a ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court in 1994, the term \"defence\" has been defined to not only include protection of the borders of Germany, but also crisis reaction and conflict prevention, or more broadly as guarding the security of Germany anywhere in the world. As of 2017,[update] the German military has about 3,600 troops stationed in foreign countries as part of international peacekeeping forces, including about 1,200 supporting operations against Daesh, 980 in the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan, and 800 in Kosovo.[168][169]\nGermany has a social market economy with a highly skilled labour force, a low level of corruption, and a high level of innovation.[4][171][172] It is the world's third-largest exporter and third-largest importer,[4] and has the largest economy in Europe, which is also the world's fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP,[173] and the fifth-largest by PPP.[174] Its GDP per capita measured in purchasing power standards amounts to 121% of the EU27 average.[175] The service sector contributes approximately 69% of the total GDP, industry 31%, and agriculture 1% as of 2017[update].[4] The unemployment rate published by Eurostat amounts to 3.2% as of January\u00a02020[update], which is the fourth-lowest in the EU.[176]\nGermany is part of the European single market which represents more than 450 million consumers.[177] In 2017, the country accounted for 28% of the Eurozone economy according to the International Monetary Fund.[178] Germany introduced the common European currency, the euro, in 2002.[179] Its monetary policy is set by the European Central Bank, which is headquartered in Frankfurt.[180][170]\nBeing home to the modern car, the automotive industry in Germany is regarded as one of the most competitive and innovative in the world,[181] and is the sixth-largest by production as of 2021. The top ten exports of Germany are vehicles, machinery, chemical goods, electronic products, electrical equipments, pharmaceuticals, transport equipments, basic metals, food products, and rubber and plastics.[182]\nOf the world's 500 largest stock-market-listed companies measured by revenue in 2019, the Fortune Global 500, 29 are headquartered in Germany.[183] 30 major Germany-based companies are included in the DAX, the German stock market index which is operated by Frankfurt Stock Exchange.[184] Well-known international brands include Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Volkswagen, Audi, Siemens, Allianz, Adidas, Porsche, Bosch and Deutsche Telekom.[185] Berlin is a hub for startup companies and has become the leading location for venture capital funded firms in the European Union.[186] Germany is recognised for its large portion of specialised small and medium enterprises, known as the Mittelstand model.[187] These companies represent 48% global market leaders in their segments, labelled hidden champions.[188]\nResearch and development efforts form an integral part of the German economy.[189] In 2018 Germany ranked fourth globally in terms of number of science and engineering research papers published.[190] Research institutions in Germany include the Max Planck Society, the Helmholtz Association, and the Fraunhofer Society and the Leibniz Association.[191] Germany is the largest contributor to the European Space Agency.[192]\nWith its central position in Europe, Germany is a transport hub for the continent.[193] Its road network is among the densest in Europe.[194] The motorway (Autobahn) is widely known for having no general federally mandated speed limit for some classes of vehicles.[195] The Intercity Express or ICE train network serves major German cities as well as destinations in neighbouring countries with speeds up to 300\u00a0km/h (190\u00a0mph).[196] The largest German airports are Frankfurt Airport and Munich Airport.[197] The Port of Hamburg is one of the top twenty largest container ports in the world.[198]\nIn 2015[update], Germany was the world's seventh-largest consumer of energy.[199] All nuclear power plants were phased out in 2023.[200] It meets the country's power demands using 40% renewable sources, and it has been called an \"early leader\" in solar and offshore wind.[201][202] Germany is committed to the Paris Agreement and several other treaties promoting biodiversity, low emission standards, and water management.[203][204][205] The country's household recycling rate is among the highest in the world\u2014at around 65%.[206] The country's greenhouse gas emissions per capita were the ninth-highest in the EU in 2018[update], but these numbers have been trending downward.[207][208] The German energy transition (Energiewende) is the recognised move to a sustainable economy by means of energy efficiency and renewable energy.[209][202]\nGermany is the ninth-most visited country in the world as of 2017[update], with 37.4 million visits.[210] Domestic and international travel and tourism combined directly contribute over \u20ac105.3\u00a0billion to German GDP. Including indirect and induced impacts, the industry supports 4.2 million jobs.[211]\nGermany's most visited and popular landmarks include Cologne Cathedral, the Brandenburg Gate, the Reichstag, the Dresden Frauenkirche, Neuschwanstein Castle, Heidelberg Castle, the Wartburg, and Sanssouci Palace.[212] The Europa-Park near Freiburg is Europe's second-most popular theme park resort.[213]\nWith a population of 80.2\u00a0million according to the 2011 German Census,[214] rising to 83.7\u00a0million as of 2022[update],[215] Germany is the most populous country in the European Union, the second-most populous country in Europe after Russia, and the nineteenth-most populous country in the world. Its population density stands at 227 inhabitants per square kilometre (588 per square mile). The fertility rate of 1.57 children born per woman (2022 estimates) is below the replacement rate of 2.1 and is one of the lowest fertility rates in the world.[4] Since the 1970s, Germany's death rate has exceeded its birth rate. However, Germany is witnessing increased birth rates and migration rates since the beginning of the 2010s. Germany has the third oldest population in the world, with an average age of 47.4 years.[4]\nFour sizeable groups of people are referred to as \"national minorities\" because their ancestors have lived in their respective regions for centuries:[216] There is a Danish minority in the northernmost state of Schleswig-Holstein;[216] the Sorbs, a Slavic population, are in the Lusatia region of Saxony and Brandenburg; the Roma and Sinti live throughout the country; and the Frisians are concentrated in Schleswig-Holstein's western coast and in the north-western part of Lower Saxony.[216]\nAfter the United States, Germany is the second-most popular immigration destination in the world. The majority of migrants live in western Germany, in particular in urban areas. Of the country's residents, 18.6\u00a0million people (22.5%) were of immigrant or partially immigrant descent in 2016 (including persons descending or partially descending from ethnic German repatriates).[217] In 2015, the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs listed Germany as host to the second-highest number of international migrants worldwide, about 5% or 12\u00a0million of all 244\u00a0million migrants.[218] As of 2019[update], Germany ranks seventh amongst EU countries in terms of the percentage of migrants in the country's population, at 13.1%.[219]\nGermany has a number of large cities. There are 11 officially recognised metropolitan regions. The country's largest city is Berlin, while its largest urban area is the Ruhr.[220]\nChristianity was introduced to the area of modern Germany by 300 AD and became fully Christianized by the time of Charlemagne in the eighth and ninth century. After the Reformation started by Martin Luther in the early 16th century, many people left the Catholic Church and became Protestant, mainly Lutheran and Calvinist.[221]\nAccording to the 2011 census, Christianity was the largest religion in Germany, with 66.8% of respondents identifying as Christian, of which 3.8% were not church members.[222] 31.7% declared themselves as Protestants, including members of the Evangelical Church in Germany (which encompasses Lutheran, Reformed, and administrative or confessional unions of both traditions) and the free churches (Evangelische Freikirchen); 31.2% declared themselves as Roman Catholics, and Orthodox believers constituted 1.3%. According to data from 2016, the Catholic Church and the Evangelical Church claimed 28.5% and 27.5%, respectively, of the population.[223][224] Islam is the second-largest religion in the country.[225]\nIn the 2011 census, 1.9% of respondents (1.52\u00a0million people) gave their religion as Islam, but this figure is deemed unreliable because a disproportionate number of adherents of this faith (and other religions, such as Judaism) are likely to have made use of their right not to answer the question.[226] Most of the Muslims are Sunnis and Alevites from Turkey, but there are a small number of Shi'ites, Ahmadiyyas and other denominations. Other religions comprise less than one percent of Germany's population.[225]\nA study in 2018 estimated that 38% of the population are not members of any religious organization or denomination,[227] though up to a third may still consider themselves religious. Irreligion in Germany is strongest in the former East Germany, which used to be predominantly Protestant before the enforcement of state atheism, and in major metropolitan areas.[228][229]\nGerman is the official and predominant spoken language in Germany.[230] It is one of 24 official and working languages of the European Union, and one of the three procedural languages of the European Commission.[231] German is the most widely spoken first language in the European Union, with around 100 million native speakers.[232]\nRecognised native minority languages in Germany are Danish, Low German, Low Rhenish, Sorbian, Romani, North Frisian and Saterland Frisian; they are officially protected by the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. The most used immigrant languages are Turkish, Arabic, Kurdish, Polish, Greek, Serbo-Croatian, Bulgarian and other Balkan languages, as well as Russian. Germans are typically multilingual: 67% of German citizens claim to be able to communicate in at least one foreign language and 27% in at least two.[230]\nResponsibility for educational supervision in Germany is primarily organised within the individual states. Optional kindergarten education is provided for all children between three and six years old, after which school attendance is compulsory for at least nine years depending on the state. Primary education usually lasts for four to six years.[233] Secondary schooling is divided into tracks based on whether students pursue academic or vocational education.[234] A system of apprenticeship called Duale Ausbildung leads to a skilled qualification which is almost comparable to an academic degree. It allows students in vocational training to learn in a company as well as in a state-run trade school.[233] This model is well regarded and reproduced all around the world.[235]\nMost of the German universities are public institutions, and students traditionally study without fee payment.[236] The general requirement for attending university is the Abitur. According to an OECD report in 2014, Germany is the world's third leading destination for international study.[237] The established universities in Germany include some of the oldest in the world, with Heidelberg University (established in 1386) being the oldest.[238] The Humboldt University of Berlin, founded in 1810 by the liberal educational reformer Wilhelm von Humboldt, became the academic model for many Western universities.[239][240] In the contemporary era Germany has developed eleven Universities of Excellence.\nGermany's system of hospitals, called Krankenh\u00e4user, dates from medieval times, and today, Germany has the world's oldest universal health care system, dating from Bismarck's social legislation of the 1880s.[242] Since the 1880s, reforms and provisions have ensured a balanced health care system. The population is covered by a health insurance plan provided by statute, with criteria allowing some groups to opt for a private health insurance contract. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Germany's health care system was 77% government-funded and 23% privately funded as of 2013[update].[243] In 2014, Germany spent 11.3% of its GDP on health care.[244]\nGermany ranked 21st in the world in 2019 in life expectancy with 78.7 years for men and 84.8 years for women according to the WHO, and it had a very low infant mortality rate (4 per 1,000 live births). In 2019[update], the principal cause of death was cardiovascular disease, at 37%.[245] Obesity in Germany has been increasingly cited as a major health issue. A 2014 study showed that 52 percent of the adult German population was overweight or obese.[246]\nCulture in German states has been shaped by major intellectual and popular currents in Europe, both religious and secular. Historically, Germany has been called Das Land der Dichter und Denker ('the land of poets and thinkers'),[247] because of the major role its scientists, writers and philosophers have played in the development of Western thought.[248] A global opinion poll for the BBC revealed that Germany is recognised for having the most positive influence in the world in 2013 and 2014.[249][250]\nGermany is well known for such folk festival traditions as the Oktoberfest and Christmas customs, which include Advent wreaths, Christmas pageants, Christmas trees, Stollen cakes, and other practices.[251][252] As of 2016[update] UNESCO inscribed 41 properties in Germany on the World Heritage List.[253] There are a number of public holidays in Germany determined by each state; 3 October has been a national day of Germany since 1990, celebrated as the Tag der Deutschen Einheit (German Unity Day).[254]\nGerman classical music includes works by some of the world's most well-known composers. Dieterich Buxtehude, Johann Sebastian Bach and Georg Friedrich H\u00e4ndel were influential composers of the Baroque period. Ludwig van Beethoven was a crucial figure in the transition between the Classical and Romantic eras. Carl Maria von Weber, Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann and Johannes Brahms were significant Romantic composers. Richard Wagner was known for his operas. Richard Strauss was a leading composer of the late Romantic and early modern eras. Karlheinz Stockhausen and Wolfgang Rihm are important composers of the 20th and early 21st centuries.[255]\nAs of 2013, Germany was the second-largest music market in Europe, and fourth-largest in the world.[256] German popular music of the 20th and 21st centuries includes the movements of Neue Deutsche Welle, pop, Ostrock, heavy metal/rock, punk, pop rock, indie, Volksmusik (folk music), schlager pop and German hip hop. German electronic music gained global influence, with Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream pioneering in this genre.[257] DJs and artists of the techno and house music scenes of Germany have become well known (e.g. Paul van Dyk, Felix Jaehn, Paul Kalkbrenner, Robin Schulz and Scooter).[258]\nGerman painters have influenced Western art. Albrecht D\u00fcrer, Hans Holbein the Younger, Matthias Gr\u00fcnewald and Lucas Cranach the Elder were important German artists of the Renaissance, Johann Baptist Zimmermann of the Baroque, Caspar David Friedrich and Carl Spitzweg of Romanticism, Max Liebermann of Impressionism and Max Ernst of Surrealism. Several German art groups formed in the 20th century; Die Br\u00fccke (The Bridge) and Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider) influenced the development of expressionism in Munich and Berlin. The New Objectivity arose in response to expressionism during the Weimar Republic. After World War II, broad trends in German art include neo-expressionism and the New Leipzig School.[259]\nGerman designers became early leaders of modern product design.[260] The Berlin Fashion Week and the fashion trade fair Bread & Butter are held twice a year.[261]\nArchitectural contributions from Germany include the Carolingian and Ottonian styles, which were precursors of Romanesque. Brick Gothic is a distinctive medieval style that evolved in Germany. Also in Renaissance and Baroque art, regional and typically German elements evolved (e.g. Weser Renaissance).[259] Vernacular architecture in Germany is often identified by its timber framing (Fachwerk) traditions and varies across regions, and among carpentry styles.[262] When industrialisation spread across Europe, classicism and a distinctive style of historicism developed in Germany, sometimes referred to as Gr\u00fcnderzeit style. Expressionist architecture developed in the 1910s in Germany and influenced Art Deco and other modern styles. Germany was particularly important in the early modernist movement: it is the home of Werkbund initiated by Hermann Muthesius (New Objectivity), and of the Bauhaus movement founded by Walter Gropius.[259] Ludwig Mies van der Rohe became one of the world's most renowned architects in the second half of the 20th century; he conceived of the glass fa\u00e7ade skyscraper.[263] Renowned contemporary architects and offices include Pritzker Prize winners Gottfried B\u00f6hm and Frei Otto.[264]\nGerman literature can be traced back to the Middle Ages and the works of writers such as Walther von der Vogelweide and Wolfram von Eschenbach. Well-known German authors include Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Schiller, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing and Theodor Fontane. The collections of folk tales published by the Brothers Grimm popularised German folklore on an international level.[265] The Grimms also gathered and codified regional variants of the German language, grounding their work in historical principles; their Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch, or German Dictionary, sometimes called the Grimm dictionary, was begun in 1838 and the first volumes published in 1854.[266]\nInfluential authors of the 20th century include Gerhart Hauptmann, Thomas Mann, Hermann Hesse, Heinrich B\u00f6ll and G\u00fcnter Grass.[267] The German book market is the third-largest in the world, after the United States and China.[268] The Frankfurt Book Fair is the most important in the world for international deals and trading, with a tradition spanning over 500 years.[269] The Leipzig Book Fair also retains a major position in Europe.[270]\nGerman philosophy is historically significant: Gottfried Leibniz's contributions to rationalism; the enlightenment philosophy by Immanuel Kant; the establishment of classical German idealism by Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling; Arthur Schopenhauer's composition of metaphysical pessimism; the formulation of communist theory by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels; Friedrich Nietzsche's development of perspectivism; Gottlob Frege's contributions to the dawn of analytic philosophy; Martin Heidegger's works on Being; Oswald Spengler's historical philosophy; the development of the Frankfurt School has been particularly influential.[271]\nThe largest internationally operating media companies in Germany are the Bertelsmann enterprise, Axel Springer SE and ProSiebenSat.1 Media. Germany's television market is the largest in Europe, with some 38\u00a0million TV households.[272] Around 90% of German households have cable or satellite TV, with a variety of free-to-view public and commercial channels.[273] There are more than 300 public and private radio stations in Germany; Germany's national radio network is the Deutschlandradio and the public Deutsche Welle is the main German radio and television broadcaster in foreign languages.[273] Germany's print market of newspapers and magazines is the largest in Europe.[273] The papers with the highest circulation are Bild, S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and Die Welt.[273] The largest magazines include ADAC Motorwelt and Der Spiegel.[273] Germany has a large video gaming market, with over 34 million players nationwide.[274]\nGerman cinema has made major technical and artistic contributions to film. The first works of the Skladanowsky Brothers were shown to an audience in 1895. The renowned Babelsberg Studio in Potsdam was established in 1912, thus being the first large-scale film studio in the world. Early German cinema was particularly influential with German expressionists such as Robert Wiene and Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau. Director Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927) is referred to as the first major science-fiction film. After 1945, many of the films of the immediate post-war period can be characterised as Tr\u00fcmmerfilm (rubble film). East German film was dominated by state-owned film studio DEFA, while the dominant genre in West Germany was the Heimatfilm (\"homeland film\").[275] During the 1970s and 1980s, New German Cinema directors such as Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff, Werner Herzog, Wim Wenders, and Rainer Werner Fassbinder brought West German auteur cinema to critical acclaim.\nThe Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film (\"Oscar\") went to the German production The Tin Drum (Die Blechtrommel) in 1979, to Nowhere in Africa (Nirgendwo in Afrika) in 2002, and to The Lives of Others (Das Leben der Anderen) in 2007. Various Germans won an Oscar for their performances in other films. The annual European Film Awards ceremony is held every other year in Berlin, home of the European Film Academy. The Berlin International Film Festival, known as \"Berlinale\", awarding the \"Golden Bear\" and held annually since 1951, is one of the world's leading film festivals. The \"Lolas\" are annually awarded in Berlin, at the German Film Awards.[276]\nGerman cuisine varies from region to region and often neighbouring regions share some culinary similarities (e.g. the southern regions of Bavaria and Swabia share some traditions with Switzerland and Austria). International varieties such as pizza, sushi, Chinese food, Greek food, Indian cuisine and doner kebab are also popular.\nBread is a significant part of German cuisine and German bakeries produce about 600 main types of bread and 1,200 types of pastries and rolls (Br\u00f6tchen).[277] German cheeses account for about 22% of all cheese produced in Europe.[278] In 2012 over 99% of all meat produced in Germany was either pork, chicken or beef. Germans produce their ubiquitous sausages in almost 1,500 varieties, including Bratwursts and Weisswursts.[279] The national alcoholic drink is beer.[280] German beer consumption per person stands at 110 litres (24\u00a0imp\u00a0gal; 29\u00a0US\u00a0gal) in 2013 and remains among the highest in the world.[281] German beer purity regulations date back to the 16th century.[282] Wine has become popular in many parts of the country, especially close to German wine regions.[283] In 2019, Germany was the ninth-largest wine producer in the world.[284]\nThe 2018 Michelin Guide awarded eleven restaurants in Germany three stars, giving the country a cumulative total of 300 stars.[285]\nFootball is the most popular sport in Germany. With more than 7\u00a0million official members, the German Football Association (Deutscher Fu\u00dfball-Bund) is the largest single-sport organisation worldwide,[286] and the German top league, the Bundesliga, attracts the second-highest average attendance of all professional sports leagues in the world.[287] The German men's national football team won the FIFA World Cup in 1954, 1974, 1990, and 2014,[288] the UEFA European Championship in 1972, 1980 and 1996,[289] and the FIFA Confederations Cup in 2017.[290]\nGermany is one of the leading motor sports countries in the world. Constructors like BMW and Mercedes are prominent manufacturers in motor sport. Porsche has won the 24 Hours of Le Mans race 19 times, and Audi 13 times (as of 2017[update]).[291] The driver Michael Schumacher has set many motor sport records during his career, having won seven Formula One World Drivers' Championships.[292] Sebastian Vettel is also among the most successful Formula One drivers of all time.[293]\nHistorically, German athletes have been successful contenders in the Olympic Games, ranking third in an all-time Olympic Games medal count (when combining East and West German medals).[294] In 1936 Berlin hosted the Summer Games and the Winter Games in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Munich hosted the Summer Games of 1972.[295][296]\nSources", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany#cite_note-FOOTNOTENSI_Census_data2017-214", "

Located in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, it consists of a peninsula delimited by the Alps and surrounded by several islands; its territory largely coincides with the homonymous geographical region.[17]\nItaly shares land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia and the enclaved microstates of Vatican City and San Marino. It has a territorial exclave in Switzerland, Campione, and some islands in the African Plate. Italy covers an area of 301,230\u00a0km2 (116,310\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), with a population of about 60 million.[18] It is the third-most populous member state of the European Union, the sixth-most populous country in Europe, and the tenth-largest country in the continent by land area. Italy's capital and largest city is Rome.\nItaly was the native place of civilizations such as the Italic peoples and the Etruscans, while due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean, the country has also historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures, who immigrated to the peninsula throughout history.[19][20] The Latins, native of central Italy, formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC, which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People. The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula, eventually expanding and conquering a large part of Europe, North Africa and Western Asia. By the first century BC, the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural, political and religious centre, inaugurating the Pax Romana, a period of more than 200 years during which Italy's law, technology, economy, art, and literature developed.[21][22]\nDuring the Early Middle Ages, Italy endured the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the Barbarian Invasions, but by the 11th century, numerous city-states and maritime republics, mostly in the North, became prosperous through trade, commerce, and banking, laying the groundwork for modern capitalism.[23][24] The Renaissance began in Italy and spread to the rest of Europe, bringing a renewed interest in humanism, science, exploration, and art. During the Middle Ages, Italian explorers discovered new routes to the Far East and the New World, helping to usher in the European Age of Discovery. However, centuries of rivalry and infighting between the Italian city-states, and the invasions of other European powers during the Italian Wars of the 15th and 16th centuries, left Italy politically fragmented.[25][26] Italy's commercial and political power significantly waned during the 17th and 18th centuries with the decline of the Catholic Church and the increasing importance of trade routes that bypassed the Mediterranean.[27]\nBy the mid-19th century, rising Italian nationalism, along with other social, economic, and military events, led to a period of revolutionary political upheaval.[28] After centuries of political and territorial divisions, Italy was almost entirely unified in 1861 following a war of independence, establishing the Kingdom of Italy.[29] From the late 19th century to the early 20th century, Italy rapidly industrialised, mainly in the north, and acquired a colonial empire,[30] while the south remained largely impoverished and excluded from industrialisation, fuelling a large and influential diaspora.[31] Despite being one of the victorious allied powers in World War I, Italy entered a period of economic crisis and social turmoil, leading to the rise of the Italian fascist dictatorship in 1922. The participation of Italy in World War II on the Axis led to the Italian surrender to Allied powers and its occupation by Nazi Germany helped by Fascists, followed by the rise of the Italian Resistance and the subsequent Italian Civil War and liberation of Italy. After the war, the country abolished its monarchy, established a democratic unitary parliamentary republic, and enjoyed a prolonged economic boom, becoming a major advanced economy.[32]\nItaly has the eighth-largest nominal GDP (third in the European Union) in the world, the ninth-largest national wealth and the third-largest central bank gold reserve. The country has been described as the \"least of the great powers\", and it has a significant role in regional[33][34] and global[35][36] economic, military, cultural, and diplomatic affairs. Italy is a founding and leading member of the European Union and a member of numerous international institutions, including the United Nations, NATO, the OECD, the G7, the Latin Union, the Schengen Area, and many more. The source of many inventions and discoveries, the country is considered a cultural superpower[37] and has long been a global centre of art, music, literature, philosophy, science and technology, tourism and fashion, as well as having greatly influenced and contributed to diverse fields including cinema, cuisine, sports, jurisprudence, banking, and business.[38] It has the world's largest number of World Heritage Sites (58), and is the world's fifth-most visited country.\nHypotheses for the etymology of the name \"Italia\" are numerous.[39] One is that it was borrowed via Ancient Greek from the Oscan V\u00edteli\u00fa 'land of calves' (cf. Lat vitulus \"calf\", Umb vitlo \"calf\").[40] Ancient Greek historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus states this account together with the legend that Italy was named after Italus,[41] mentioned also by Aristotle[42] and Thucydides.[43]\nAccording to Antiochus of Syracuse, the term Italy was used by the ancient Greeks to initially refer only to the southern portion of the Bruttium peninsula corresponding to the modern province of Reggio and part of the provinces of Catanzaro and Vibo Valentia in southern Italy. Nevertheless, by his time the larger concept of Oenotria and \"Italy\" had become synonymous, and the name also applied to most of Lucania as well. According to Strabo's Geographica, before the expansion of the Roman Republic, the name was used by ancient Greeks to indicate the land between the strait of Messina and the line connecting the gulf of Salerno and gulf of Taranto, corresponding roughly to the current region of Calabria. The ancient Greeks gradually came to apply the name \"Italia\" to a larger region[44] In addition to the \"Greek Italy\" in the south, historians have suggested the existence of an \"Etruscan Italy\" covering variable areas of central Italy.[45]\nThe borders of Roman Italy, Italia, are better established. Cato's Origines, the first work of history composed in Latin, described Italy as the entire peninsula south of the Alps.[46] According to Cato and several Roman authors, the Alps formed the \"walls of Italy\".[47] In 264 BC, Roman Italy extended from the Arno and Rubicon rivers of the centre-north to the entire south. The northern area of Cisalpine Gaul was occupied by Rome in the 220s BC and became considered geographically and de facto part of Italy,[48] but remained politically and de jure separated. It was legally merged into the administrative unit of Italy in 42 BC by the triumvir Octavian as a ratification of Caesar's unpublished acts (Acta Caesaris).[49][50][51][52][53] The islands of Sardinia, Corsica, Sicily and Malta were added to Italy by Diocletian in 292 AD,[54] coinciding with the whole Italian geographical region.[55] All its inhabitants were considered Italic and Roman.[56]\nThe Latin term Italicus was used to describe \"a man of Italy\" as opposed to a provincial. For example, Pliny the Elder notably wrote in a letter Italicus es an provincialis? meaning \"are you an Italian or a provincial?\".[57]\nThe adjective italianus, from which are derived the Italian (and also French and English) name of the Italians, is medieval and was used alternatively with Italicus during the early modern period.[58]\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire, which was caused by the invasion of the Ostrogoths, the Kingdom of Italy was created. After the Lombard invasions, \"Italia\" was retained as the name for their kingdom, and for its successor kingdom within the Holy Roman Empire, which nominally lasted until 1806, although it had de facto disintegrated due to factional politics pitting the empire against the ascendant city republics in the 13th century.[59]\nThousands of Lower Paleolithic artefacts have been recovered from Monte Poggiolo, dating as far back as 850,000 years.[61]\nExcavations throughout Italy revealed a Neanderthal presence dating back to the Middle Palaeolithic period some 200,000 years ago,[62] while modern humans appeared about 40,000 years ago at Riparo Mochi.[63] Archaeological sites from this period include Addaura cave, Altamura, Ceprano, and Gravina in Puglia.[64]\nThe Ancient peoples of pre-Roman Italy \u2013 such as the Umbrians, the Latins (from which the Romans emerged), Volsci, Oscans, Samnites, Sabines, the Celts, the Ligures, the Veneti, the Iapygians, and many others \u2013 were Indo-European peoples, most of them specifically of the Italic group. The main historic peoples of possible non-Indo-European or pre-Indo-European heritage include the Etruscans of central and northern Italy, the Elymians and the Sicani in Sicily, and the prehistoric Sardinians, who gave birth to the Nuragic civilisation. Other ancient populations being of undetermined language families and of possible non-Indo-European origin include the Rhaetian people and Cammuni, known for their rock carvings in Valcamonica, the largest collections of prehistoric petroglyphs in the world.[65] A well-preserved natural mummy known as \u00d6tzi the Iceman, determined to be 5,000 years old (between 3400 and 3100 BCE, Copper Age), was discovered in the Similaun glacier of South Tyrol in 1991.[66]\nThe first foreign colonisers were the Phoenicians, who initially established colonies and founded various emporiums on the coasts of Sicily and Sardinia. Some of these soon became small urban centres and were developed parallel to the ancient Greek colonies; among the main centres there were the cities of Motya, Zyz (modern Palermo), Soluntum in Sicily, and Nora, Sulci, and Tharros in Sardinia.[67]\nBetween the 17th and the 11th centuries BC Mycenaean Greeks established contacts with Italy[68][69][70] and in the 8th and 7th centuries BC a number of Greek colonies were established all along the coast of Sicily and the southern part of the Italian Peninsula, that became known as Magna Graecia.[71]\nIonian settlers founded Elaia, Kyme, Rhegion, Naxos, Zankles, Hymera, and Katane. Doric colonists founded Taras, Syrakousai, Megara Hyblaia, Leontinoi, Akragas, Ghelas; the Syracusans founded Ank\u00f3n and Adria; the megarese founded Selinunte. The Achaeans founded Sybaris, Poseidonia, Kroton, Lokroi Epizephyrioi, and Metapontum; tarantini and thuriots found Herakleia. The Greek colonization placed the Italic peoples in contact with democratic forms of government and with high artistic and cultural expressions.[72]\nRome, a settlement around a ford on the river Tiber in central Italy conventionally founded in 753 BC, was ruled for a period of 244 years by a monarchical system, initially with sovereigns of Latin and Sabine origin, later by Etruscan kings. The tradition handed down seven kings: Romulus, Numa Pompilius, Tullus Hostilius, Ancus Marcius, Tarquinius Priscus, Servius Tullius and Tarquinius Superbus. In 509 BC, the Romans expelled the last king from their city, favouring a government of the Senate and the People (SPQR) and establishing an oligarchic republic.\nThe Italian Peninsula, named Italia, was consolidated into a single entity during the Roman expansion and conquest of new lands at the expense of the other Italic tribes, Etruscans, Celts, and Greeks. A permanent association with most of the local tribes and cities was formed, and Rome began the conquest of Western Europe, Northern Africa and the Middle East. In the wake of Julius Caesar's rise and death in the first century BC, Rome grew over the course of centuries into a massive empire stretching from Britain to the borders of Persia, and engulfing the whole Mediterranean basin, in which Greek and Roman and many other cultures merged into a unique civilisation. The long and triumphant reign of the first emperor, Augustus, began a golden age of peace and prosperity. Roman Italy remained the metropole of the empire, and as the homeland of the Romans and the territory of the capital, maintained a special status which made it Domina Provinciarum (\"ruler of the provinces\", the latter being all the remaining territories outside Italy).[73][74][75] More than two centuries of stability followed, during which Italy was referred to as the Rectrix Mundi (\"governor of the world\") and Omnium Terrarum Parens (\"parent of all lands\").[76]\nThe Roman Empire was among the most powerful economic, cultural, political and military forces in the world of its time, and it was one of the largest empires in world history. At its height under Trajan, it covered 5 million square kilometres.[77][78] The Roman legacy has deeply influenced Western civilisation, shaping most of the modern world; among the many legacies of Roman dominance are the widespread use of the Romance languages derived from Latin, the numerical system, the modern Western alphabet and calendar, and the emergence of Christianity as a major world religion.[79] The Indo-Roman trade relations, beginning around the 1st century BCE, testify to extensive Roman trade in far away regions; many reminders of the commercial trade between the Indian subcontinent and Italy have been found, such as the ivory statuette Pompeii Lakshmi from the ruins of Pompeii.\nIn a slow decline since the third century AD, the Empire split in two in 395 AD. The Western Empire, under the pressure of the barbarian invasions, eventually dissolved in 476 AD when its last emperor, Romulus Augustulus, was deposed by the Germanic chief Odoacer. The Eastern half of the Empire survived for another thousand years.\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Italy fell under the power of Odoacer's kingdom, and, later, was seized by the Ostrogoths,[80] followed in the 6th century by a brief reconquest under Byzantine Emperor Justinian. The invasion of another Germanic tribe, the Lombards, late in the same century, reduced the Byzantine presence to the rump realm of the Exarchate of Ravenna and started the end of political unity of the peninsula for the next 1,300 years. The peninsula was therefore divided as follows: northern Italy and Tuscany formed the Lombard kingdom, with its capital in Pavia, while in central-southern Italy the Lombards controlled the duchies of Spoleto and Benevento. The remaining part of the peninsula remained under the Byzantines and was divided between the exarchate of Italy, based in Ravenna, the Duchy of Rome, the Duchy of Naples, the Duchy of Calabria and Sicily, the latter directly dependent on the Emperor of Constantinople.[81] Invasions of the peninsula caused a chaotic succession of barbarian kingdoms and the so-called \"dark ages\". The Lombard kingdom was subsequently absorbed into the Frankish Empire by Charlemagne in the late 8th century and became the Kingdom of Italy.[82] The Franks also helped the formation of the Papal States in central Italy. Until the 13th century, Italian politics was dominated by the relations between the Holy Roman Emperors and the Papacy, with most of the Italian city-states siding with the former (Ghibellines) or with the latter (Guelphs) for momentary convenience.[83]\nThe Germanic Emperor and the Roman Pontiff became the universal powers of medieval Europe. However, the conflict over the investiture controversy (a conflict between two radically different views of whether secular authorities such as kings, counts, or dukes, had any legitimate role in appointments to ecclesiastical offices) and the clash between Guelphs and Ghibellines led to the end of the Imperial-feudal system in the north of Italy where city-states gained independence. It was during this chaotic era that Italian towns saw the rise of a peculiar institution, the medieval commune. Given the power vacuum caused by extreme territorial fragmentation and the struggle between the Empire and the Holy See, local communities sought autonomous ways to maintain law and order.[85] The investiture controversy was finally resolved by the Concordat of Worms. In 1176 a league of city-states, the Lombard League, defeated the German emperor Frederick Barbarossa at the Battle of Legnano, thus ensuring effective independence for most of northern and central Italian cities.\nItalian city-states such as Milan, Florence and Venice played a crucial innovative role in financial development, devising the main instruments and practices of banking and the emergence of new forms of social and economic organization.[86] In coastal and southern areas, the maritime republics grew to eventually dominate the Mediterranean and monopolise trade routes to the Orient. They were independent thalassocratic city-states, though most of them originated from territories once belonging to the Byzantine Empire. All these cities during the time of their independence had similar systems of government in which the merchant class had considerable power. Although in practice these were oligarchical, and bore little resemblance to a modern democracy, the relative political freedom they afforded was conducive to academic and artistic advancement.[87] The four best known maritime republics were Venice, Genoa, Pisa and Amalfi; the others were Ancona, Gaeta, Noli, and Ragusa.[88][89][90] Each of the maritime republics had dominion over different overseas lands, including many Mediterranean islands (especially Sardinia and Corsica), lands on the Adriatic, Aegean, and Black Sea (Crimea), and commercial colonies in the Near East and in North Africa. Venice maintained enormous tracts of land in Greece, Cyprus, Istria, and Dalmatia until as late as the mid-17th century.[91]\nVenice and Genoa were Europe's main gateways to trade with the East, and producers of fine glass, while Florence was a capital of silk, wool, banking, and jewellery. The wealth such business brought to Italy meant that large public and private artistic projects could be commissioned. The republics were heavily involved in the Crusades, providing support and transport, but most especially taking advantage of the political and trading opportunities resulting from these wars.[87] Italy first felt the huge economic changes in Europe which led to the commercial revolution: the Republic of Venice was able to defeat the Byzantine Empire and finance the voyages of Marco Polo to Asia; the first universities were formed in Italian cities, and scholars such as Thomas Aquinas obtained international fame; Frederick I of Sicily made Italy the political-cultural centre of a reign that temporarily included the Holy Roman Empire and the Kingdom of Jerusalem; capitalism and banking families emerged in Florence, where Dante and Giotto were active around 1300.[23]\nIn the south, Sicily had become an Islamic emirate in the 9th century, thriving until the Italo-Normans conquered it in the late 11th century together with most of the Lombard and Byzantine principalities of southern Italy.[92] Through a complex series of events, southern Italy developed as a unified kingdom, first under the House of Hohenstaufen, then under the Capetian House of Anjou and, from the 15th century, the House of Aragon. In Sardinia, the former Byzantine provinces became independent states known in Italian as Judicates, although some parts of the island fell under Genoese or Pisan rule until eventual Aragonese annexation in the 15th century. The Black Death pandemic of 1348 left its mark on Italy by killing perhaps one third of the population.[93][94] However, the recovery from the plague led to a resurgence of cities, trade, and economy, which allowed the blossoming of Humanism and Renaissance that later spread to Europe.\nItaly was the birthplace and heart of the Renaissance during the 1400s and 1500s. The Italian Renaissance marked the transition from the medieval period to the modern age as Europe recovered, economically and culturally, from the crises of the Late Middle Ages and entered the Early Modern Period. The Italian polities were now regional states effectively ruled by Princes, de facto monarchs in control of trade and administration, and their courts became major centres of the Arts and Sciences. The Italian princedoms represented a first form of modern states as opposed to feudal monarchies and multinational empires. The princedoms were led by political dynasties and merchant families such as the Medici in Florence, the Visconti and Sforza in the Duchy of Milan, the Doria in the Republic of Genoa, the Loredan, Mocenigo and Barbarigo in the Republic of Venice, the Este in Ferrara, and the Gonzaga in Mantua.[95][96] The Renaissance was therefore a result of the wealth accumulated by Italian merchant cities combined with the patronage of its dominant families.[95] Italian Renaissance exercised a dominant influence on subsequent European painting and sculpture for centuries afterwards, with artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Brunelleschi, Botticelli, Michelangelo, Raphael, Giotto, Donatello, and Titian, and architects such as Filippo Brunelleschi, Leon Battista Alberti, Andrea Palladio, and Donato Bramante.\nFollowing the conclusion of the western schism in favour of Rome at the Council of Constance (1415\u20131417), the new Pope Martin V returned to the Papal States after a three years-long journey that touched many Italian cities and restored Italy as the sole centre of Western Christianity. During the course of this voyage, the Medici Bank was made the official credit institution of the Papacy, and several significant ties were established between the Church and the new political dynasties of the peninsula. The Popes' status as elective monarchs turned the conclaves and consistories of the Renaissance into political battles between the courts of Italy for primacy in the peninsula and access to the immense resources of the Catholic Church. In 1439, Pope Eugenius IV and the Byzantine Emperor John VIII Palaiologos signed a reconciliation agreement between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church at the Council of Florence hosted by Cosimo the old de Medici. In 1453, Italian forces under Giovanni Giustiniani were sent by Pope Nicholas V to defend the Walls of Constantinople but the decisive battle was lost to the more advanced Turkish army equipped with cannons, and Byzantium fell to Sultan Mehmed II.\nThe fall of Constantinople led to the migration of Greek scholars and texts to Italy, fueling the rediscovery of Greco-Roman Humanism.[97][98][99] Humanist rulers such as Federico da Montefeltro and Pope Pius II worked to establish ideal cities where man is the measure of all things, and therefore founded Urbino and Pienza respectively. Pico della Mirandola wrote the Oration on the Dignity of Man, considered the manifesto of Renaissance Humanism, in which he stressed the importance of free will in human beings. The humanist historian Leonardo Bruni was the first to divide human history in three periods: Antiquity, Middle Ages and Modernity.[100] The second consequence of the Fall of Constantinople was the beginning of the Age of Discovery.\nItalian[note 2] explorers and navigators from the dominant maritime republics, eager to find an alternative route to the Indies in order to bypass the Ottoman Empire, offered their services to monarchs of Atlantic countries and played a key role in ushering the Age of Discovery and the European colonization of the Americas. The most notable among them were: Christopher Columbus (Italian: Cristoforo Colombo), colonizer in the name of Spain, who is credited with discovering the New World and the opening of the Americas for conquest and settlement by Europeans;[101] John Cabot (Italian: Giovanni Caboto), sailing for England, who was the first European to set foot in \"New Found Land\" and explore parts of the North American continent in 1497;[102] Amerigo Vespucci, sailing for Portugal, who first demonstrated in about 1501 that the New World (in particular Brazil) was not Asia as initially conjectured, but a fourth continent previously unknown to people of the Old World (America is named after him);[103] and Giovanni da Verrazzano, at the service of France, renowned as the first European to explore the Atlantic coast of North America between Florida and New Brunswick in 1524.[104]\nFollowing the fall of Constantinople, the wars in Lombardy came to an end and a defensive alliance known as Italic League was formed between Venice, Naples, Florence, Milan, and the Papacy. Lorenzo the Magnificent de Medici was the greatest Florentine patron of the Renaissance and supporter of the Italic League. He notably avoided the collapse of the League in the aftermath of the Pazzi Conspiracy and during the aborted invasion of Italy by the Turks. However, the military campaign of Charles VIII of France in Italy caused the end of the Italic League and initiated the Italian Wars between the Valois and the Habsburgs. During the High Renaissance of the 1500s, Italy was therefore both the main European battleground and the cultural-economic centre of the continent. Popes such as Julius II (1503\u20131513) fought for the control of Italy against foreign monarchs, others such as Paul III (1534\u20131549) preferred to mediate between the European powers in order to secure peace in Italy. In the middle of this conflict, the Medici popes Leo X (1513\u20131521) and Clement VII (1523\u20131534) opposed the Protestant reformation and advanced the interests of their family. In 1559, at the end of the French invasions of Italy and of the Italian wars, the many states of northern Italy remained part of the Holy Roman Empire, indirectly subject to the Austrian Habsburgs, while all of Southern Italy (Naples, Sicily, Sardinia) and Milan were under Spanish Habsburg rule.\nThe Papacy remained a powerful force and launched the Counter-reformation. Key events of the period include: the Council of Trent (1545\u20131563); the excommunication of Elizabeth I (1570) and the Battle of Lepanto (1571), both occurring during the pontificate of Pius V; the construction of the Gregorian observatory, the adoption of the Gregorian calendar, and the Jesuit China mission of Matteo Ricci under Pope Gregory XIII; the French Wars of Religion; the Long Turkish War and the execution of Giordano Bruno in 1600, under Pope Clement VIII; the birth of the Lyncean Academy of the Papal States, of which the main figure was Galileo Galilei (later put on trial); the final phases of the Thirty Years' War (1618\u20131648) during the pontificates of Urban VIII and Innocent X; and the formation of the last Holy League by Innocent XI during the Great Turkish War.\nThe Italian economy declined during the 1600s and 1700s, as the peninsula was excluded from the rising Atlantic slave trade. Following the European wars of succession of the 18th century, the south passed to a cadet branch of the Spanish Bourbons and the North fell under the influence of the Habsburg-Lorraine of Austria. During the Coalition Wars, northern-central Italy was reorganised by Napoleon in a number of Sister Republics of France and later as a Kingdom of Italy in personal union with the French Empire.[105] The southern half of the peninsula was administered by Joachim Murat, Napoleon's brother-in-law, who was crowned as King of Naples. The 1814 Congress of Vienna restored the situation of the late 18th century, but the ideals of the French Revolution could not be eradicated, and soon re-surfaced during the political upheavals that characterised the first part of the 19th century.\nDuring the Napoleonic era, in 1797, the first official adoption of the Italian tricolour as a national flag by a sovereign Italian state, the Cispadane Republic, a Napoleonic sister republic of Revolutionary France, took place, on the basis of the events following the French Revolution (1789\u20131799) which, among its ideals, advocated the national self-determination.[106][107] This event is celebrated by the Tricolour Day.[108] The Italian national colours appeared for the first time on a tricolour cockade in 1789,[109] anticipating by seven years the first green, white and red Italian military war flag, which was adopted by the Lombard Legion in 1796.[110]\nThe birth of the Kingdom of Italy was the result of efforts by Italian nationalists and monarchists loyal to the House of Savoy to establish a united kingdom encompassing the entire Italian Peninsula. Following the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the political and social Italian unification movement, or Risorgimento, emerged to unite Italy consolidating the different states of the peninsula and liberate it from foreign control. A prominent radical figure was the patriotic journalist Giuseppe Mazzini, member of the secret revolutionary society Carbonari and founder of the influential political movement Young Italy in the early 1830s, who favoured a unitary republic and advocated a broad nationalist movement. His prolific output of propaganda helped the unification movement stay active.\nIn this context, in 1847, the first public performance of the song Il Canto degli Italiani, the Italian national anthem since 1946, took place.[113][114] Il Canto degli Italiani, written by Goffredo Mameli set to music by Michele Novaro, is also known as the Inno di Mameli, after the author of the lyrics, or Fratelli d'Italia, from its opening line.\nThe most famous member of Young Italy was the revolutionary and general Giuseppe Garibaldi, renowned for his extremely loyal followers,[115] who led the Italian republican drive for unification in Southern Italy. However, the Northern Italy monarchy of the House of Savoy in the Kingdom of Sardinia, whose government was led by Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, also had ambitions of establishing a united Italian state. In the context of the 1848 liberal revolutions that swept through Europe, an unsuccessful first war of independence was declared on Austria. In 1855, the Kingdom of Sardinia became an ally of Britain and France in the Crimean War, giving Cavour's diplomacy legitimacy in the eyes of the great powers.[116][117] The Kingdom of Sardinia again attacked the Austrian Empire in the Second Italian War of Independence of 1859, with the aid of France, resulting in liberating Lombardy. On the basis of the Plombi\u00e8res Agreement, the Kingdom of Sardinia ceded Savoy and Nice to France, an event that caused the Ni\u00e7ard exodus, that was the emigration of a quarter of the Ni\u00e7ard Italians to Italy,[118] and the Ni\u00e7ard Vespers.\nIn 1860\u20131861, Garibaldi led the drive for unification in Naples and Sicily (the Expedition of the Thousand),[119] while the House of Savoy troops occupied the central territories of the Italian peninsula, except Rome and part of Papal States. Teano was the site of the famous meeting of 26 October 1860 between Giuseppe Garibaldi and Victor Emmanuel II, last King of Sardinia, in which Garibaldi shook Victor Emanuel's hand and hailed him as King of Italy; thus, Garibaldi sacrificed republican hopes for the sake of Italian unity under a monarchy. Cavour agreed to include Garibaldi's Southern Italy allowing it to join the union with the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1860. This allowed the Sardinian government to declare a united Italian kingdom on 17 March 1861.[120] Victor Emmanuel II then became the first king of a united Italy, and the capital was moved from Turin to Florence.\nIn 1866, Victor Emmanuel II allied with Prussia during the Austro-Prussian War, waging the Third Italian War of Independence which allowed Italy to annexe Venetia. Finally, in 1870, as France abandoned its garrisons in Rome during the disastrous Franco-Prussian War to keep the large Prussian Army at bay, the Italians rushed to fill the power gap by taking over the Papal States. Italian unification was completed and shortly afterwards Italy's capital was moved to Rome. Victor Emmanuel, Garibaldi, Cavour, and Mazzini have been referred as Italy's Four Fathers of the Fatherland.[111]\nThe new Kingdom of Italy obtained Great Power status. The Constitutional Law of the Kingdom of Sardinia the Albertine Statute of 1848, was extended to the whole Kingdom of Italy in 1861, and provided for basic freedoms of the new State, but electoral laws excluded the non-propertied and uneducated classes from voting. The government of the new kingdom took place in a framework of parliamentary constitutional monarchy dominated by liberal forces. As Northern Italy quickly industrialised, the South and rural areas of the North remained underdeveloped and overpopulated, forcing millions of people to migrate abroad and fuelling a large and influential diaspora. The Italian Socialist Party constantly increased in strength, challenging the traditional liberal and conservative establishment.\nStarting in the last two decades of the 19th century, Italy developed into a colonial power by forcing under its rule Eritrea and Somalia in East Africa, Tripolitania and Cyrenaica in North Africa (later unified in the colony of Libya) and the Dodecanese islands.[121] From 2 November 1899 to 7 September 1901, Italy also participated as part of the Eight-Nation Alliance forces during the Boxer Rebellion in China; on 7 September 1901, a concession in Tientsin was ceded to the country, and on 7 June 1902, the concession was taken into Italian possession and administered by a consul. In 1913, male universal suffrage was adopted. The pre-war period dominated by Giovanni Giolitti, Prime Minister five times between 1892 and 1921, was characterised by the economic, industrial, and political-cultural modernization of Italian society.\nItaly entered into the First World War in 1915 with the aim of completing national unity: for this reason, the Italian intervention in the First World War is also considered the Fourth Italian War of Independence,[122] in a historiographical perspective that identifies in the latter the conclusion of the unification of Italy, whose military actions began during the revolutions of 1848 with the First Italian War of Independence.[123][124]\nItaly, nominally allied with the German Empire and the Empire of Austria-Hungary in the Triple Alliance, in 1915 joined the Allies into World War I with a promise of substantial territorial gains, that included western Inner Carniola, former Austrian Littoral, Dalmatia as well as parts of the Ottoman Empire. The country gave a fundamental contribution to the victory of the conflict as one of the \"Big Four\" top Allied powers. The war on the Italian Front was initially inconclusive, as the Italian army got stuck in a long attrition war in the Alps, making little progress and suffering heavy losses. However, the reorganization of the army and the conscription of the so-called '99 Boys (Ragazzi del '99, all males born in 1899 who were turning 18) led to more effective Italian victories in major battles, such as on Monte Grappa and in a series of battles on the Piave river. Eventually, in October 1918, the Italians launched a massive offensive, culminating in the victory of Vittorio Veneto. The Italian victory,[125][126][127] which was announced by the Bollettino della Vittoria and the Bollettino della Vittoria Navale, marked the end of the war on the Italian Front, secured the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and was chiefly instrumental in ending the First World War less than two weeks later. Italian armed forces were also involved in the African theatre, the Balkan theatre, the Middle Eastern theatre, and then took part in the Occupation of Constantinople.\nDuring the war, more than 650,000 Italian soldiers and as many civilians died,[128] and the kingdom went to the brink of bankruptcy. The Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919) and the Treaty of Rapallo (1920) allowed the annexation of Trentino Alto-Adige, Julian March, Istria, Kvarner as well as the Dalmatian city of Zara. The subsequent Treaty of Rome (1924) led to the annexation of the city of Fiume to Italy. Italy did not receive other territories promised by the Treaty of London (1915), so this outcome was denounced as a Mutilated victory. The rhetoric of Mutilated victory was adopted by Benito Mussolini and led to the rise of Italian fascism, becoming a key point in the propaganda of Fascist Italy. Historians regard Mutilated victory as a \"political myth\", used by fascists to fuel Italian imperialism and obscure the successes of liberal Italy in the aftermath of World War I.[129] Italy also gained a permanent seat in the League of Nations's executive council.\nThe socialist agitations that followed the devastation of the Great War, inspired by the Russian Revolution, led to counter-revolution and repression throughout Italy. The liberal establishment, fearing a Soviet-style revolution, started to endorse the small National Fascist Party, led by Benito Mussolini. In October 1922 the Blackshirts of the National Fascist Party attempted a mass demonstration and a coup named the \"March on Rome\" which failed but at the last minute, King Victor Emmanuel III refused to proclaim a state of siege and appointed Mussolini prime minister, thereby transferring political power to the fascists without armed conflict.[130][131] Over the next few years, Mussolini banned all political parties and curtailed personal liberties, thus forming a dictatorship. These actions attracted international attention and eventually inspired similar dictatorships such as Nazi Germany and Francoist Spain.\nItalian Fascism is based upon Italian nationalism and imperialism, and in particular seeks to complete what it considers as the incomplete project of the unification of Italy by incorporating Italia Irredenta (unredeemed Italy) into the state of Italy.[132][133] To the east of Italy, the Fascists claimed that Dalmatia was a land of Italian culture whose Italians, including those of Italianized South Slavic descent, had been driven out of Dalmatia and into exile in Italy, and supported the return of Italians of Dalmatian heritage.[134] Mussolini identified Dalmatia as having strong Italian cultural roots for centuries, similarly to Istria, via the Roman Empire and the Republic of Venice.[135] To the south of Italy, the Fascists claimed Malta, which belonged to the United Kingdom, and Corfu, which instead belonged to Greece; to the north claimed Italian Switzerland, while to the west claimed Corsica, Nice, and Savoy, which belonged to France.[136][137] The Fascist regime produced literature on Corsica that presented evidence of the island's italianit\u00e0.[138] The Fascist regime produced literature on Nice that justified that Nice was an Italian land based on historic, ethnic, and linguistic grounds.[138]\nThe Armistice of Villa Giusti, which ended fighting between Italy and Austria-Hungary at the end of World War I, resulted in Italian annexation of neighbouring parts of Yugoslavia. During the interwar period, the fascist Italian government undertook a campaign of Italianisation in the areas it annexed, which suppressed Slavic language, schools, political parties, and cultural institutions. Between 1922 and the beginning of World War II, the affected people were also the German-speaking and Ladin-speaking populations of Trentino-Alto Adige, and the French- and Arpitan-speaking regions of the western Alps, such as the Aosta valley.[139]\nMussolini promised to bring Italy back as a great power in Europe, building a \"New Roman Empire\"[140] and holding power over the Mediterranean Sea. In propaganda, Fascists used the ancient Roman motto \"Mare Nostrum\" (Latin for \"Our Sea\") to describe the Mediterranean. For this reason the Fascist regime engaged in interventionist foreign policy. In 1923, the Greek island of Corfu was briefly occupied by Italy, after the assassination of General Tellini in Greek territory. In 1925, Italy forced Albania to become a de facto protectorate. In 1935, Mussolini invaded Ethiopia and founded Italian East Africa, resulting in an international alienation and leading to Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations; Italy allied with Nazi Germany and the Empire of Japan and strongly supported Francisco Franco in the Spanish civil war. In 1939, Italy formally annexed Albania. Italy entered World War II on 10 June 1940. The Italians initially advanced in British Somaliland, Egypt, the Balkans (establishing the Governorate of Dalmatia and Montenegro, the Province of Ljubljana, and the puppet states Independent State of Croatia and Hellenic State), and eastern fronts. They were, however, subsequently defeated on the Eastern Front as well as in the East African campaign and the North African campaign, losing as a result their territories in Africa and in the Balkans.\nDuring World War II, Italian war crimes included extrajudicial killings and ethnic cleansing[141] by deportation of about 25,000 people, mainly Jews, Croats, and Slovenians, to the Italian concentration camps, such as Rab, Gonars, Monigo, Renicci di Anghiari, and elsewhere. Yugoslav Partisans perpetrated their own crimes against the local ethnic Italian population (Istrian Italians and Dalmatian Italians) during and after the war, including the foibe massacres.\nIn Italy and Yugoslavia, unlike in Germany, few war crimes were prosecuted.[142][143][144][145]\nAn Allied invasion of Sicily began in July 1943, leading to the collapse of the Fascist regime and the fall of Mussolini on 25 July. Mussolini was deposed and arrested by order of King Victor Emmanuel III in co-operation with the majority of the members of the Grand Council of Fascism, which passed a motion of no confidence. On 8 September, Italy signed the Armistice of Cassibile, ending its war with the Allies. Shortly thereafter, the Germans, with the assistance of the Italian fascists, succeeded in taking control of northern and central Italy. The country remained a battlefield for the rest of the war, with the Allies slowly moving up from the south.\nIn the north, the Germans set up the Italian Social Republic (RSI), a Nazi puppet state with Mussolini installed as leader after he was rescued by German paratroopers. Some Italian troops in the south were organised into the Italian Co-belligerent Army, which fought alongside the Allies for the rest of the war, while other Italian troops, loyal to Mussolini and his RSI, continued to fight alongside the Germans in the National Republican Army. Also, the post-armistice period saw the rise of a large anti-fascist resistance movement, the Resistenza, which fought a guerrilla war against the Nazi German occupiers and Italian Fascist forces. As result, the country descended into civil war. In late April 1945, with total defeat looming, Mussolini attempted to escape north,[146] but was captured and summarily executed near Lake Como by Italian partisans. His body was then taken to Milan, where it was hung upside down at a service station for public viewing and to provide confirmation of his demise.[147]\nHostilities ended on 29 April 1945, when the German forces in Italy surrendered. Nearly half a million Italians (including civilians) died in the conflict,[148] society was divided and the Italian economy had been all but destroyed; per capita income in 1944 was at its lowest point since the beginning of the 20th century.[149] The aftermath of World War II left Italy also with an anger against the monarchy for its endorsement of the Fascist regime for the previous twenty years. These frustrations contributed to a revival of the Italian republican movement.[150]\nItaly became a republic after the 1946 Italian institutional referendum[151] held on 2 June 1946, a day celebrated since as Festa della Repubblica. This was the first time that Italian women voted at the national level, and the second time overall considering the local elections that were held a few months earlier in some cities.[152][153] Victor Emmanuel III's son, Umberto II, was forced to abdicate and exiled. The Republican Constitution was approved on 1 January 1948. Under the Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947, Istria, Kvarner, most of the Julian March as well as the Dalmatian city of Zara was annexed by Yugoslavia causing the Istrian-Dalmatian exodus, which led to the emigration of between 230,000 and 350,000 of local ethnic Italians (Istrian Italians and Dalmatian Italians), the others being ethnic Slovenians, ethnic Croatians, and ethnic Istro-Romanians, choosing to maintain Italian citizenship.[154] Later, the Free Territory of Trieste was divided between the two states. Italy also lost all of its colonial possessions, formally ending the Italian Empire. In 1950, Italian Somaliland was made a United Nations Trust Territory under Italian administration until 1 July 1960. The Italian border that applies today has existed since 1975, when Trieste was formally re-annexed to Italy.\nFears of a possible Communist takeover proved crucial for the first universal suffrage electoral outcome on 18 April 1948, when the Christian Democrats, under the leadership of Alcide De Gasperi, obtained a landslide victory.[155][156] Consequently, in 1949 Italy became a member of NATO. The Marshall Plan helped to revive the Italian economy which, until the late 1960s, enjoyed a period of sustained economic growth commonly called the \"Economic Miracle\". In the 1950's, Italy became one of the six founding countries of the European Communities, following the 1952 establishment of the European Coal and Steel Community, and subsequent 1958 creations of the European Economic Community and European Atomic Energy Community. In 1993, the former two of these were incorporated into the European Union.\nFrom the late 1960s until the early 1980s, the country experienced the Years of Lead, a period characterised by economic crisis, especially after the 1973 oil crisis, widespread social conflicts and terrorist massacres carried out by opposing extremist groups, with the alleged involvement of US and Soviet intelligence.[157][158][159] The Years of Lead culminated in the assassination of the Christian Democrat leader Aldo Moro in 1978 and the Bologna railway station massacre in 1980, where 85 people died.\nIn the 1980s, for the first time since 1945, two governments were led by non-Christian-Democrat premiers: one republican, Giovanni Spadolini, and one socialist, Bettino Craxi; the Christian Democrats remained, however, the main government party. During Craxi's government, the economy recovered and Italy became the world's fifth-largest industrial nation after it gained the entry into the Group of Seven in the 1970s. However, as a result of his spending policies, the Italian national debt skyrocketed during the Craxi era, soon passing 100% of the country's GDP.\nItaly faced several terror attacks between 1992 and 1993 perpetrated by the Sicilian Mafia as a consequence of several life sentences pronounced during the \"Maxi Trial\", and of the new anti-mafia measures launched by the government. In 1992, two major dynamite attacks killed the judges Giovanni Falcone (23 May in the Capaci bombing) and Paolo Borsellino (19 July in the Via D'Amelio bombing).[160] One year later (May\u2013July 1993), tourist spots were attacked, such as the Via dei Georgofili in Florence, Via Palestro in Milan, and the Piazza San Giovanni in Laterano and Via San Teodoro in Rome, leaving 10 dead and 93 injured and causing severe damage to cultural heritage such as the Uffizi Gallery. The Catholic Church openly condemned the Mafia, and two churches were bombed and an anti-Mafia priest shot dead in Rome.[161][162][163]\nAlso in the early 1990s, Italy faced significant challenges, as voters \u2013 disenchanted with political paralysis, massive public debt and the extensive corruption system (known as Tangentopoli) uncovered by the Clean Hands (Mani Pulite) investigation \u2013 demanded radical reforms. The scandals involved all major parties, but especially those in the government coalition: the Christian Democrats, who ruled for almost 50 years, underwent a severe crisis and eventually disbanded, splitting up into several factions.[164] The Communists reorganised as a social-democratic force. During the 1990s and the 2000s, centre-right (dominated by media magnate Silvio Berlusconi) and centre-left coalitions (led by university professor Romano Prodi) alternately governed the country.\nAmidst the Great Recession, Berlusconi resigned in 2011, and his conservative government was replaced by the technocratic cabinet of Mario Monti.[165] Following the 2013 general election, the Vice-Secretary of the Democratic Party Enrico Letta formed a new government at the head of a right-left Grand coalition. In 2014, challenged by the new Secretary of the PD Matteo Renzi, Letta resigned and was replaced by Renzi. The new government started constitutional reforms such as the abolition of the Senate and a new electoral law. On 4 December the constitutional reform was rejected in a referendum and Renzi resigned; the Foreign Affairs Minister Paolo Gentiloni was appointed new Prime Minister.[166]\nIn the European migrant crisis of the 2010s, Italy was the entry point and leading destination for most asylum seekers entering the EU. From 2013 to 2018, the country took in over 700,000 migrants and refugees,[167] mainly from sub-Saharan Africa,[168] which caused strain on the public purse and a surge in the support for far-right or euro-sceptic political parties.[169][170] The 2018 general election was characterised by a strong showing of the Five Star Movement and the League and the university professor Giuseppe Conte became the Prime Minister at the head of a populist coalition between these two parties.[171] However, after only fourteen months the League withdrew its support to Conte, who formed a new unprecedented government coalition between the Five Star Movement and the centre-left.[172][173]\nIn 2020, Italy was severely hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.[174] From March to May, Conte's government imposed a national lockdown as a measure to limit the spread of the disease,[175][176] while further restrictions were introduced during the following winter.[177] The measures, despite being widely approved by the public opinion,[178] were also described as the largest suppression of constitutional rights in the history of the republic.[179][180] With more than 155,000 confirmed victims, Italy was one of the countries with the highest total number of deaths in the worldwide coronavirus pandemic.[181] The pandemic caused also a severe economic disruption, in which Italy resulted as one of the most affected countries.[182]\nIn February 2021, after a government crisis within his majority, Conte was forced to resign and Mario Draghi, former president of the European Central Bank, formed a national unity government supported by almost all the main parties,[183] pledging to oversee implementation of economic stimulus to face the crisis caused by the pandemic.[184] On 22 October 2022, Giorgia Meloni was sworn in as Italy's first female prime minister. Her Brothers of Italy party formed a right-wing government with the far-right League and Berlusconi's Forza Italia.[185]\nItaly, whose territory largely coincides with the homonymous geographical region,[17] is located in Southern Europe and it is also considered a part of western Europe,[16] between latitudes 35\u00b0 and 47\u00b0 N, and longitudes 6\u00b0 and 19\u00b0 E. To the north, Italy borders France, Switzerland, Austria, and Slovenia and is roughly delimited by the Alpine watershed, enclosing the Po Valley and the Venetian Plain. To the south, it consists of the entirety of the Italian Peninsula and the two Mediterranean islands of Sicily and Sardinia (the two biggest islands of the Mediterranean), in addition to many smaller islands. The sovereign states of San Marino and the Vatican City are enclaves within Italy,[186][187] while Campione d'Italia is an Italian exclave in Switzerland.[188]\nThe country's total area is 301,230 square kilometres (116,306\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), of which 294,020\u00a0km2 (113,522\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) is land and 7,210\u00a0km2 (2,784\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) is water.[189] Including the islands, Italy has a coastline and border of 7,600 kilometres (4,722 miles) on the Adriatic, Ionian, Tyrrhenian seas (740\u00a0km (460\u00a0mi)), and borders shared with France (488\u00a0km (303\u00a0mi)), Austria (430\u00a0km (267\u00a0mi)), Slovenia (232\u00a0km (144\u00a0mi)) and Switzerland (740\u00a0km (460\u00a0mi)). San Marino (39\u00a0km (24\u00a0mi)) and Vatican City (3.2\u00a0km (2.0\u00a0mi)), both enclaves, account for the remainder.[189]\nOver 35% of the Italian territory is mountainous.[190] The Apennine Mountains form the peninsula's backbone, and the Alps form most of its northern boundary, where Italy's highest point is located on Mont Blanc (Monte Bianco) (4,810\u00a0m or 15,780\u00a0ft). Other worldwide-known mountains in Italy include the Matterhorn (Monte Cervino), Monte Rosa, Gran Paradiso in the West Alps, and Bernina, Stelvio and Dolomites along the eastern side.\nThe Po, Italy's longest river (652 kilometres or 405 miles), flows from the Alps on the western border with France and crosses the Padan plain on its way to the Adriatic Sea. The Po Valley is the largest plain in Italy, with 46,000\u00a0km2 (18,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), and it represents over 70% of the total plain area in the country.[190]\nMany elements of the Italian territory are of volcanic origin. Most of the small islands and archipelagos in the south, like Capraia, Ponza, Ischia, Eolie, Ustica and Pantelleria are volcanic islands. There are also active volcanoes: Mount Etna in Sicily (the largest active volcano in Europe), Vulcano, Stromboli, and Vesuvius (the only active volcano on mainland Europe).\nThe five largest lakes are, in order of diminishing size: Garda (367.94\u00a0km2 or 142\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), Maggiore (212.51\u00a0km2 or 82\u00a0sq\u00a0mi, whose minor northern part is part of Switzerland), Como (145.9\u00a0km2 or 56\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), Trasimeno (124.29\u00a0km2 or 48\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and Bolsena (113.55\u00a0km2 or 44\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[191] Four different seas surround the Italian Peninsula in the Mediterranean Sea from three sides: the Adriatic Sea in the east,[192] the Ionian Sea in the south,[193] and the Ligurian Sea and the Tyrrhenian Sea in the west.[194] The longest Italian river is the Po, which flows for either 652\u00a0km (405\u00a0mi) or 682\u00a0km (424\u00a0mi).[195] Most of the rivers of Italy drain either into the Adriatic Sea or the Tyrrhenian Sea.[196]\nAlthough the country includes the Italian peninsula, adjacent islands, and most of the southern Alpine basin, some of Italy's territory extends beyond the Alpine basin and some islands are located outside the Eurasian continental shelf. These territories are the comuni of: Livigno, Sexten, Innichen, Toblach (in part), Chiusaforte, Tarvisio, Graun im Vinschgau (in part), which are all part of the Danube's drainage basin, while the Val di Lei constitutes part of the Rhine's basin and the islands of Lampedusa and Lampione are on the African continental shelf.\nAfter its quick industrial growth, Italy took a long time to confront its environmental problems. After several improvements, it now ranks 84th in the world for ecological sustainability.[197] National parks cover about 5% of the country,[198] while the total area protected by national parks, regional parks and nature reserves covers about 10.5% of the Italian territory,[199] to which must be added 12% of coasts protected by marine protected areas.[200]\nIn the last decade, Italy has become one of the world's leading producers of renewable energy, ranking as the world's fourth largest holder of installed solar energy capacity[201][202] and the sixth largest holder of wind power capacity in 2010.[203] Renewable energies provided approximately 37% Italy's energy consumption in 2020.[204]\nHowever, air pollution remains a severe problem, especially in the industrialised north, reaching the tenth highest level worldwide of industrial carbon dioxide emissions in the 1990s.[205] Italy is the twelfth-largest carbon dioxide producer.[206][207]\nExtensive traffic and congestion in the largest metropolitan areas continue to cause severe environmental and health issues, even if smog levels have decreased dramatically since the 1970s and 1980s, and the presence of smog is becoming an increasingly rarer phenomenon and levels of sulphur dioxide are decreasing.[208]\nMany watercourses and coastal stretches have also been contaminated by industrial and agricultural activity, while because of rising water levels, Venice has been regularly flooded throughout recent years. Waste from industrial activity is not always disposed of by legal means and has led to permanent health effects on inhabitants of affected areas, as in the case of the Seveso disaster.\nThe country has also operated several nuclear reactors between 1963 and 1990 but, after the Chernobyl disaster and a referendum on the issue the nuclear programme was terminated, a decision that was overturned by the government in 2008, planning to build up to four nuclear power plants with French technology. This was in turn struck down by a referendum following the Fukushima nuclear accident.[209]\nDeforestation, illegal building developments and poor land-management policies have led to significant erosion all over Italy's mountainous regions, leading to major ecological disasters like the 1963 Vajont Dam flood, the 1998 Sarno[210] and 2009 Messina mudslides.\nThe country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 3.65/10, ranking it 142nd globally out of 172 countries.[211]\nItaly has one the highest level of faunal biodiversity in Europe, with over 57,000 species recorded, representing more than a third of all European fauna.[212] Italy's varied geological structure contributes to its high climate and habitat diversity. The Italian peninsula is in the centre of the Mediterranean Sea, forming a corridor between central Europe and North Africa, and has 8,000\u00a0km (5,000\u00a0mi) of coastline. Italy also receives species from the Balkans, Eurasia, and the Middle East. Italy's varied geological structure, including the Alps and the Apennines, Central Italian woodlands, and Southern Italian Garigue and Maquis shrubland, also contribute to high climate and habitat diversity.\nThe fauna of Italy includes 4,777 endemic animal species,[213] which include the Sardinian long-eared bat, Sardinian red deer, spectacled salamander, brown cave salamander, Italian newt, Italian frog, Apennine yellow-bellied toad, Italian wall lizard, Aeolian wall lizard, Sicilian wall lizard, Italian Aesculapian snake, and Sicilian pond turtle. In Italy there are 119 mammals species,[214] 550 bird species,[215] 69 reptile species,[216] 39 amphibian species,[217] 623 fish species[218] and 56,213 invertebrate species, of which 37,303 insect species.[219]\nThe flora of Italy was traditionally estimated to comprise about 5,500 vascular plant species.[220] However, as of 2005[update], 6,759 species are recorded in the Data bank of Italian vascular flora.[221] Italy has 1,371 endemic plant species and subspecies,[222] which include Sicilian Fir, Barbaricina columbine, Sea marigold, Lavender cotton and Ucriana violet. Italy is a signatory to the Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats and the Habitats Directive both affording protection to Italian fauna and flora.\nItaly has many botanical gardens and historic gardens, some of which are known outside the country.[223][224] The Italian garden is stylistically based on symmetry, axial geometry and on the principle of imposing order over nature. It influenced the history of gardening, especially French gardens and English gardens.[225] The Italian garden was influenced by Roman gardens and Italian Renaissance gardens.\nThe Italian wolf is the national animal of Italy,[226][227] while the national tree of the country is the strawberry tree.[228] The reasons for this choice are related to the fact that the Italian wolf, which inhabits the Apennine Mountains and the Western Alps, features prominently in Latin and Italian cultures, such as in the legend of the founding of Rome,[229] while the green leaves, white flowers and red berries of the strawberry tree, which is native to the Mediterranean region, recall the colours of the flag of Italy.[228]\nThe climate of Italy is influenced by the large body of water of the Mediterranean Sea that surrounds Italy on every side except the north. These seas constitute a reservoir of heat and humidity for Italy. Within the southern temperate zone, they determine a Mediterranean climate with local differences due to the geomorphology of the territory, which tends to make its mitigating effects felt, especially in high pressure conditions.[231]\nBecause of the length of the peninsula and the mostly mountainous hinterland, the climate of Italy is highly diverse. In most of the inland northern and central regions, the climate ranges from humid subtropical to humid continental and oceanic. The climate of the Po valley geographical region is mostly humid subtropical, with cool winters and hot summers.[232][233] The coastal areas of Liguria, Tuscany and most of the South generally fit the Mediterranean climate stereotype (K\u00f6ppen climate classification).\nConditions on the coast are different from those in the interior, particularly during winter months when the higher altitudes tend to be cold, wet, and often snowy. The coastal regions have mild winters and hot and generally dry summers; lowland valleys are hot in summer. Average winter temperatures vary from around 0\u00a0\u00b0C (32\u00a0\u00b0F) in the Alps to 12\u00a0\u00b0C (54\u00a0\u00b0F) in Sicily, so average summer temperatures range from 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F) to over 25\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F).\nWinters can vary widely across the country with lingering cold, foggy and snowy periods in the north and milder, sunnier conditions in the south. Summers are hot across the country, except for at high altitude, particularly in the south. Northern and central areas can experience occasional strong thunderstorms from spring to autumn.[234]\nItaly has been a unitary parliamentary republic since 2 June 1946, when the monarchy was abolished by a constitutional referendum. The President of Italy (Presidente della Repubblica), currently Sergio Mattarella since 2015, is Italy's head of state. The President is elected for a single seven years mandate by the Parliament of Italy and some regional voters in joint session. Italy has a written democratic constitution, resulting from the work of a Constituent Assembly formed by the representatives of all the anti-fascist forces that contributed to the defeat of Nazi and Fascist forces during the Italian Civil War.[235]\nItaly has a parliamentary government based on a mixed proportional and majoritarian voting system. The parliament is perfectly bicameral: the two houses, the Chamber of Deputies that meets in Palazzo Montecitorio, and the Senate of the Republic that meets in Palazzo Madama, have the same powers. The Prime Minister, officially President of the Council of Ministers (Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri), is Italy's head of government. The Prime Minister and the cabinet are appointed by the President of the Republic of Italy and must pass a vote of confidence in Parliament to come into office. To remain the Prime Minister has to pass also eventual further votes of confidence or no confidence in Parliament.\nThe prime minister is the President of the Council of Ministers\u00a0\u2013 which holds effective executive power\u00a0\u2013 and he must receive a vote of approval from it to execute most political activities. The office is similar to those in most other parliamentary systems, but the head of the Italian government is not authorised to request the dissolution of the Parliament of Italy.\nAnother difference with similar offices is that the overall political responsibility for intelligence is vested in the President of the Council of Ministers. By virtue of that, the Prime Minister has exclusive power to coordinate intelligence policies, determine the financial resources and strengthen national cyber security; apply and protect State secrets; authorise agents to carry out operations, in Italy or abroad, in violation of the law.[236]\nA peculiarity of the Italian Parliament is the representation given to Italian citizens permanently living abroad: 8 Deputies and 4 Senators elected in four distinct overseas constituencies. In addition, the Italian Senate is characterised also by a small number of senators for life, appointed by the President \"for outstanding patriotic merits in the social, scientific, artistic or literary field\". Former Presidents of the Republic are ex officio life senators.\nItaly's three major political parties are the Brothers of Italy, the Democratic Party and the Five Star Movement. During the 2022 general election, these three parties and their coalitions won 357 out of 400 seats available in the Chamber of Deputies and 187 out of 200 in the Senate. The centre-right coalition, which included Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy, Matteo Salvini's League, Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia and Maurizio Lupi's Us Moderates, won a majority of the seats in parliament. The rest of the seats were taken by the centre-left coalition, which included Enrico Letta's Democratic Party, Angelo Bonelli's Greens and Left Alliance, Aosta Valley, Emma Bonino's More Europe & Luigi Di Maio's Civic Commitment, as well as by Giuseppe Conte's Five Star Movement, Carlo Calenda's Action - Italia Viva, Philipp Achammer and Stefan Premstaller's South Tyrolean People's Party, Cateno De Luca's South Calls North and Ricardo Antonio Merlo's Associative Movement of Italians Abroad.\nThe law of Italy has a plurality of sources of production. These are arranged in a hierarchical scale, under which the rule of a lower source cannot conflict with the rule of an upper source (hierarchy of sources).[237] The Constitution of 1948 is the main source.[238]\nThe judiciary of Italy is based on Roman law modified by the Napoleonic code and later statutes. The Supreme Court of Cassation is the highest court in Italy for both criminal and civil appeal cases. The Constitutional Court of Italy (Corte Costituzionale) rules on the conformity of laws with the constitution and is a post\u2013World War II innovation.\nSince their appearance in the middle of the 19th century, Italian organised crime and criminal organisations have infiltrated the social and economic life of many regions in Southern Italy, the most notorious of which being the Sicilian Mafia, which would later expand into some foreign countries including the United States. Mafia receipts may reach 9%[239][240] of Italy's GDP.[241]\nA 2009 report identified 610 comuni which have a strong Mafia presence, where 13 million Italians live and 14.6% of the Italian GDP is produced.[242][243] The Calabrian 'Ndrangheta, nowadays probably the most powerful crime syndicate of Italy, accounts alone for 3% of the country's GDP.[244] However, at 0.013 per 1,000 people, Italy has only the 47th highest murder rate[245] compared to 61 countries and the 43rd highest number of rapes per 1,000 people compared to 64 countries in the world. These are relatively low figures among developed countries.\nThe Italian law enforcement system is complex, with multiple police forces.[246] The national policing agencies are the Polizia di Stato (State Police), the Arma dei Carabinieri, the Guardia di Finanza (Financial Guard), and the Polizia Penitenziaria (Prison Police),[247] as well as the Guardia Costiera (coast guard police).[246] Although policing in Italy is primarily provided on a national basis,[247] there also exists Polizia Provinciale (provincial police) and Polizia Municipale (municipal police).[246]\nItaly is a founding member of the European Economic Community (EEC), now the European Union (EU), and of NATO. Italy was admitted to the United Nations in 1955, and it is a member and a strong supporter of a wide number of international organisations, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade/World Trade Organization (GATT/WTO), the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the Council of Europe, and the Central European Initiative. Its recent or upcoming turns in the rotating presidency of international organisations include the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe in 2018, the G7 in 2017 and the EU Council from July to December 2014. Italy is also a recurrent non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, the most recently in 2017.\nItaly strongly supports multilateral international politics, endorsing the United Nations and its international security activities. In 2013, Italy had 5,296 troops deployed abroad, engaged in 33 UN and NATO missions in 25 countries of the world.[248] Italy deployed troops in support of UN peacekeeping missions in Somalia, Mozambique, and East Timor and provides support for NATO and UN operations in Bosnia, Kosovo and Albania. Italy deployed over 2,000 troops in Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) from February 2003.\nItaly supported international efforts to reconstruct and stabilise Iraq, but it had withdrawn its military contingent of some 3,200 troops by 2006, maintaining only humanitarian operators and other civilian personnel.\nIn August 2006 Italy deployed about 2,450 troops in Lebanon for the United Nations' peacekeeping mission UNIFIL.[249] Italy is one of the largest financiers of the Palestinian National Authority, contributing \u20ac60 million in 2013 alone.[250]\nThe Italian Army, Navy, Air Force and Carabinieri collectively form the Italian Armed Forces, under the command of the High Council of Defence, presided over by the President of Italy, as established by article 87 of the Constitution of Italy. According to article 78, the Parliament has the authority to declare a state of war and vest the necessary powers in the Government.\nDespite not being a branch of the armed forces, the Guardia di Finanza (\"Financial Guard\") has military status and is organized along military lines.[note 3] Since 2005, military service is voluntary.[251] In 2010, the Italian military had 293,202 personnel on active duty,[252] of which 114,778 are Carabinieri.[253] As part of NATO's nuclear sharing strategy Italy also hosts 90 United States B61 nuclear bombs, located in the Ghedi and Aviano air bases.[254]\nThe Italian Army is the national ground defence force. Its best-known combat vehicles are the Dardo infantry fighting vehicle, the Centauro tank destroyer and the Ariete tank, and among its aircraft the Mangusta attack helicopter, in the last years deployed in EU, NATO and UN missions. It also has at its disposal many Leopard 1 and M113 armoured vehicles. It was formed in 1946 from what remained of the Regio Esercito (\"Royal Army\", which was established on the occasion of the proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy, 1861) after World War II, when Italy became a republic following a referendum.\nThe Italian Navy is a blue-water navy. In modern times the Italian Navy, being a member of the EU and NATO, has taken part in many coalition peacekeeping operations around the world. It was formed in 1946 from what remained of the Regia Marina (\"Royal Navy\", which was established on the occasion of the proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy, 1861) after World War II, when Italy became a republic following a referendum. The Italian Navy in 2014 operates 154 vessels in service, including minor auxiliary vessels.[255]\nThe Italian Air Force in 2021 operates 219 combat jets. A transport capability is guaranteed by a fleet of 27 C-130Js and C-27J Spartan. The Italian Air Force was founded as an independent service arm on 28 March 1923 by King Victor Emmanuel III as the Regia Aeronautica (\"Royal Air Force\"). After World War II, when Italy became a republic following a referendum, the Regia Aeronautica was given its current name. The acrobatic display team is the Frecce Tricolori (\"Tricolour Arrows\").\nAn autonomous corps of the military, the Carabinieri are the gendarmerie and military police of Italy, policing the military and civilian population alongside Italy's other police forces. While the different branches of the Carabinieri report to separate ministries for each of their individual functions, the corps reports to the Ministry of Internal Affairs when maintaining public order and security.[256]\nItaly is constituted by 20 regions (regioni)\u2014five of these regions having a special autonomous status that enables them to enact legislation on additional matters, 107 provinces (province) or metropolitan cities (citt\u00e0 metropolitane), and 7,904 municipalities (comuni).[257] This is a list of regions in Italy:\nItaly has a major advanced[258] capitalist mixed economy, ranking as the third-largest in the Eurozone and the eighth-largest in the world.[259] A founding member of the G7, the Eurozone and the OECD, it is regarded as one of the world's most industrialised nations and a leading country in world trade and exports.[260][261][262] It is a highly developed country; ranked the 30th Human Development Index. It also performs well in life expectancy, healthcare and [263] education. The country is well known for its creative and innovative business,[264] a large and competitive agricultural sector[265] (with the world's largest wine production),[266] and for its influential and high-quality automobile, machinery, food, design and fashion industry.[267][268][269]\nItaly is the world's sixth-largest manufacturing country,[270] characterised by a smaller number of global multinational corporations than other economies of comparable size and many dynamic small and medium-sized enterprises, notoriously clustered in several industrial districts, which are the backbone of the Italian industry. This has produced a manufacturing sector often focused on the export of niche market and luxury products, that if on one side is less capable to compete on the quantity, on the other side is more capable of facing the competition from China and other emerging Asian economies based on lower labour costs, with higher quality products.[271] Italy was the world's tenth-largest exporter in 2019. Its closest trade ties are with the other countries of the European Union. Its largest export partners in 2019 were Germany (12%), France (11%), and the United States (10%).[272]\nThe automotive industry is a significant part of the Italian manufacturing sector, with over 144,000 firms and almost 485,000 employed people in 2015,[274] and a contribution of 8.5% to Italian GDP.[275] Stellantis is currently the world's fifth-largest auto maker.[276] The country boasts a wide range of acclaimed products, from compact city cars to luxury supercars such as Maserati, Lamborghini, and Ferrari.[277]\nThe Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena is the world's oldest or second oldest bank in continuous operation, depending on the definition, and the fourth-largest Italian commercial and retail bank.[278] Italy has a strong cooperative sector, with the largest share of the population (4.5%) employed by a cooperative in the EU.[279] The Val d'Agri area, Basilicata, hosts the largest onshore hydrocarbon field in Europe.[280] Moderate natural gas reserves, mainly in the Po Valley and offshore Adriatic Sea, have been discovered in recent years and constitute the country's most important mineral resource. Italy is one of the world's leading producers of pumice, pozzolana, and feldspar.[281] Another notable mineral resource is marble, especially the world-famous white Carrara marble from the Massa and Carrara quarries in Tuscany.\nItaly is part of a monetary union, the Eurozone, and of the European single market, which represents more than 500 million consumers. Several domestic commercial policies are determined by agreements among European Union (EU) members and by EU legislation. Italy introduced the common European currency, the Euro in 2002.[282][283] It is a member of the Eurozone which represents around 330 million citizens. Its monetary policy is set by the European Central Bank.\nItaly was hit hard by the Financial crisis of 2007\u201308, that exacerbated the country's structural problems.[284] Effectively, after a strong GDP growth of 5\u20136% per year from the 1950s to the early 1970s,[285] and a progressive slowdown in the 1980\u201390s, the country virtually stagnated in the 2000s.[286][287] The political efforts to revive growth with massive government spending eventually produced a severe rise in public debt, that stood at over 131.8% of GDP in 2017,[288] ranking second in the EU only after the Greek one.[289] For all that, the largest chunk of Italian public debt is owned by national subjects, a major difference between Italy and Greece,[290] and the level of household debt is much lower than the OECD average.[291]\nA gaping North\u2013South divide is a major factor of socio-economic weakness.[292] It can be noted by the huge difference in statistical income between the northern and southern regions and municipalities.[293] The richest province, Alto Adige-South Tyrol, earns 152% of the national GDP per capita, while the poorest region, Calabria, 61%.[294] The unemployment rate (11.1%) stands slightly above the Eurozone average,[295] but the disaggregated figure is 6.6% in the North and 19.2% in the South.[296] The youth unemployment rate (31.7% in March 2018) is extremely high compared to EU standards.[297]\nAccording to the last national agricultural census, there were 1.6 million farms in 2010 (\u221232.4% since 2000) covering 12,700,000\u00a0ha or 31,382,383 acres (63% of which are located in Southern Italy).[300] The vast majority (99%) are family-operated and small, averaging only 8\u00a0ha (20 acres) in size.[300] Of the total surface area in agricultural use (forestry excluded), grain fields take up 31%, olive tree orchards 8.2%, vineyards 5.4%, citrus orchards 3.8%, sugar beets 1.7%, and horticulture 2.4%. The remainder is primarily dedicated to pastures (25.9%) and feed grains (11.6%).[300]\nItaly is the world's largest wine producer,[301] and one of the leading in olive oil, fruits (apples, olives, grapes, oranges, lemons, pears, apricots, hazelnuts, peaches, cherries, plums, strawberries and kiwifruits), and vegetables (especially artichokes and tomatoes). The most famous Italian wines are probably the Tuscan Chianti and the Piedmontese Barolo. Other famous wines are Barbaresco, Barbera d'Asti, Brunello di Montalcino, Frascati, Montepulciano d'Abruzzo, Morellino di Scansano, and the sparkling wines Franciacorta and Prosecco.\nQuality goods in which Italy specialises, particularly the already mentioned wines and regional cheeses, are often protected under the quality assurance labels DOC/DOP. This geographical indication certificate, which is attributed by the European Union, is considered important in order to avoid confusion with low-quality mass-produced ersatz products.\nItaly was the first country in the world to build motorways, the so-called autostrade, reserved for fast traffic and for motor vehicles only.[303] Regarding the national road network, in 2002 there were 668,721\u00a0km (415,524\u00a0mi) of serviceable roads in Italy, including 6,487\u00a0km (4,031\u00a0mi) of motorways, state-owned but privately operated by Atlantia. In 2005, about 34,667,000 passenger cars (590 cars per 1,000 people) and 4,015,000 goods vehicles circulated on the national road network.[304]\nThe national railway network, state-owned and operated by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (FSI), in 2008 totalled 16,529\u00a0km (10,271\u00a0mi) of which 11,727\u00a0km (7,287\u00a0mi) is electrified, and on which 4,802 locomotives and railcars run. The main public operator of high-speed trains is Trenitalia, part of FSI. Higher-speed trains are divided into three categories: Frecciarossa (English: red arrow) trains operate at a maximum speed of 300\u00a0km/h on dedicated high-speed tracks; Frecciargento (English: silver arrow) trains operate at a maximum speed of 250\u00a0km/h on both high-speed and mainline tracks; and Frecciabianca (English: white arrow) trains operate on high-speed regional lines at a maximum speed of 200\u00a0km/h. Italy has 11 rail border crossings over the Alpine mountains with its neighbouring countries.\nItaly is the fifth in Europe by the number of passengers by air transport, with about 148 million passengers or about 10% of the European total in 2011.[305] In 2022 there were 45 civil airports in Italy, including the two hubs of Malpensa International Airport in Milan and Leonardo da Vinci International Airport in Rome.[306] Since October 2021, Italy's flag carrier airline is ITA Airways, which took over the brand, the IATA ticketing code, and many assets belonging to the former flag carrier Alitalia, after its bankruptcy.[307][308]\nIn 2004 there were 43 major seaports, including the seaport of Genoa, the country's largest and second-largest in the Mediterranean Sea. In 2005 Italy maintained a civilian air fleet of about 389,000 units and a merchant fleet of 581 ships.[304] The national inland waterways network has a length of 2,400\u00a0km (1,491\u00a0mi) for commercial traffic in 2012.[272]\nItaly has been the final destination of the Silk Road for many centuries. In particular, the construction of the Suez Canal intensified sea trade with East Africa and Asia from the 19th century. Since the end of the Cold War and increasing European integration, the trade relations, which were often interrupted in the 20th century, have intensified again and the northern Italian ports such as the deep-water port of Trieste in the northernmost part of the Mediterranean with its extensive rail connections to Central and Eastern Europe are once again the destination of government subsidies and significant foreign investment.[309][310][311][312][313][314]\nIn the last decade, Italy has become one of the world's largest producers of renewable energy, ranking as the second largest producer in the European Union and the ninth in the world. Wind power, hydroelectricity, and geothermal power are also significant sources of electricity in the country. Renewable sources account for 27.5% of all electricity produced in Italy, with hydro alone reaching 12.6%, followed by solar at 5.7%, wind at 4.1%, bioenergy at 3.5%, and geothermal at 1.6%.[316] The rest of the national demand is covered by fossil fuels (38.2% natural gas, 13% coal, 8.4% oil) and by imports.[316] Eni, with operations in 79 countries, is considered one of the seven \"Supermajor\" oil companies in the world, and one of the world's largest industrial companies.[317]\nSolar energy production alone accounted for almost 9% of the total electric production in the country in 2014, making Italy the country with the highest contribution from solar energy in the world.[315] The Montalto di Castro Photovoltaic Power Station, completed in 2010, is the largest photovoltaic power station in Italy with 85 MW. Other examples of large PV plants in Italy are San Bellino (70.6 MW), Cellino san Marco (42.7 MW) and Sant' Alberto (34.6 MW).[318] Italy was the first country in the world to exploit geothermal energy to produce electricity.[319] Italy had managed four nuclear reactors until the 1980s. However, nuclear power in Italy has been abandoned following a 1987 referendum (in the wake of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in Soviet Ukraine), though Italy still imports nuclear energy from Italy-owned reactors in foreign territories.\nThrough the centuries, Italy has fostered the scientific community that produced many major discoveries in physics and other sciences. During the Renaissance Italian polymaths such as Leonardo da Vinci (1452\u20131519), Michelangelo (1475\u20131564) and Leon Battista Alberti (1404\u20131472) made contributions in a variety of fields, including biology, architecture, and engineering. Galileo Galilei (1564\u20131642), an astronomer, physicist, engineer, and polymath, played a major role in the Scientific Revolution. He is considered the \"father\" of observational astronomy,[320] modern physics,[321][322] the scientific method,[323] and modern science.[324]\nThrough the centuries, Italy has fostered the scientific community that produced many major discoveries in physics and other sciences.

In mathematics, Joseph Louis Lagrange (born Giuseppe Lodovico Lagrangia, 1736\u20131813) was active before leaving Italy. Fibonacci (c. 1170 \u2013 c. 1250), and Gerolamo Cardano (1501\u20131576) made fundamental advances in mathematics.[327] Luca Pacioli established accounting to the world. Physicist Enrico Fermi (1901\u20131954), a Nobel prize laureate, led the team in Chicago that developed the first nuclear reactor. He is considered the \"architect of the nuclear age\"[325] and the \"architect of the atomic bomb\".[326] He, Emilio G. Segr\u00e8 (1905\u20131989) who discovered the elements technetium and astatine, and the antiproton), Bruno Rossi (1905\u20131993) a pioneer in Cosmic Rays and X-ray astronomy) and a number of Italian physicists were forced to leave Italy in the 1930s by Fascist laws against Jews.[328]\nOther prominent physicists include: Amedeo Avogadro (most noted for his contributions to molecular theory, in particular, the Avogadro's law and the Avogadro constant), Evangelista Torricelli (inventor of barometer), Alessandro Volta (inventor of electric battery), Guglielmo Marconi (inventor of radio), Galileo Ferraris and Antonio Pacinotti, pioneers of the induction motor, Alessandro Cruto, pioneer of light bulb and Innocenzo Manzetti, eclectic pioneer of auto and robotics, Ettore Majorana (who discovered the Majorana fermions), Carlo Rubbia (1984 Nobel Prize in Physics for work leading to the discovery of the W and Z particles at CERN). Antonio Meucci is known for developing a voice-communication device which is often credited as the first telephone.[329][330] Pier Giorgio Perotto in 1964 designed one of the first desktop programmable calculators, the Programma 101.[331][332][333]\nIn biology, Francesco Redi has been the first to challenge the theory of spontaneous generation by demonstrating that maggots come from eggs of flies and he described 180 parasites in detail and Marcello Malpighi founded microscopic anatomy, Lazzaro Spallanzani conducted research in bodily functions, animal reproduction, and cellular theory, Camillo Golgi, whose many achievements include the discovery of the Golgi complex, paved the way to the acceptance of the Neuron doctrine, Rita Levi-Montalcini discovered the nerve growth factor (awarded 1986 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine). In chemistry, Giulio Natta received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1963 for his work on high polymers. Giuseppe Occhialini received the Wolf Prize in Physics for the discovery of the pion or pi-meson decay in 1947. Ennio de Giorgi, a Wolf Prize in Mathematics recipient in 1990, solved Bernstein's problem about minimal surfaces and the 19th Hilbert problem on the regularity of solutions of Elliptic partial differential equations.[334]\nLaboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) is the largest underground research centre in the world.[335] ELETTRA, Eurac Research, ESA Centre for Earth Observation, Institute for Scientific Interchange, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation and the International Centre for Theoretical Physics conduct basic research. Trieste has the highest percentage of researchers in Europe in relation to the population.[336] Italy was ranked 28th in the Global Innovation Index in 2022.[337] There are numerous technology parks in Italy such as the Science and Technology Parks Kilometro Rosso (Bergamo), the AREA Science Park (Trieste), The VEGA-Venice Gateway for Science and Technology (Venezia), the Toscana Life Sciences (Siena), the Technology Park of Lodi Cluster (Lodi), and the Technology Park of Navacchio (Pisa),[338] as well as science museums such as the Museo Nazionale Scienza e Tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci in Milan, the Citt\u00e0 della Scienza in Naples and the Institute and Museum of the History of Science in Florence.\nWithin this great Italian History of Science and Technology, modern times tell a different and more technologically divergent story. The North\u2013South divide is a significant factor that leads to a vast difference in income between the Northern and Southern regions, which brings up the topic of the Digital Divide in Italy. The long history of this divided peninsula, now a unified nation-state, details the complex problems of underdeveloped areas in the South.[339] As expected, these problems of underdevelopment and poverty still linger today, also reflected in the concept of the digital divide between the North and South. The Global digital divide is broadly described as the technological differences between underdeveloped and developed countries. While this does not necessarily mean that people have no access to technology, it is made clear that this equates to differences in technology, such as the Internet and household electronics.[340] Digital inequalities between Northern and Southern Italy exist and are still prevalent, especially when related to education.\nPeople have visited Italy for centuries, yet the first to visit the peninsula for touristic reasons were aristocrats during the Grand Tour, beginning in the 17th century, and flourishing in the 18th and the 19th century.[343] This was a period in which European aristocrats, many of whom were British, visited parts of Europe, with Italy as a key destination.[343] For Italy, this was in order to study ancient architecture, local culture and to admire the natural beauties.[344]\nNowadays Italy is the fifth most visited country in international tourism, with a total of 52.3 million international arrivals in 2016.[345] The total contribution of travel & tourism to GDP (including wider effects from investment, the supply chain and induced income impacts) was EUR162.7bn in 2014 (10.1% of GDP) and generated 1,082,000 jobs directly in 2014 (4.8% of total employment).[346]\nFactors of tourist interest in Italy are mainly culture, cuisine, history, fashion, architecture, art, religious sites and routes, wedding tourism, naturalistic beauties, nightlife, underwater sites and spas.[347][348][349][350][351][352][353] Winter and summer tourism are present in many locations in the Alps and the Apennines,[354] while seaside tourism is widespread in coastal locations on the Mediterranean Sea.[355] Italy is the leading cruise tourism destination in the Mediterranean Sea.[356]\nThe most visited regions of Italy, measured by nights spent in tourist accommodation establishments, are Veneto, Tuscany, Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna and Lazio.[357] Rome is the 3rd most visited city in Europe and the 12th in the world, with 9.4 million arrivals in 2017 while Milan is the 27th worldwide with 6.8 million tourists.[358] In addition, Venice and Florence are also among the world's top 100 destinations.\nItaly is also the country with the highest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the world (58).[359] Out of Italy's 58 heritage sites, 53 are cultural and 5 are natural.[360] In Italy there is a broad variety of hotels, going from 1\u20135 stars. According to ISTAT, in 2017, there were 32,988 hotels with 1,133,452 rooms and 2,239,446 beds.[361] As for non-hotel facilities (campsites, tourist villages, accommodations for rent, agritourism, etc.), in 2017 their number was 171,915 with 2,798,352 beds.[361]\nAt the beginning of 2020, Italy had 60,317,116 inhabitants.[362] The resulting population density, at 202 inhabitants per square kilometre (520/sq\u00a0mi), is higher than that of most Western European countries. However, the distribution of the population is widely uneven. The most densely populated areas are the Po Valley (that accounts for almost a half of the national population) and the metropolitan areas of Rome and Naples, while vast regions such as the Alps and Apennines highlands, the plateaus of Basilicata and the island of Sardinia, as well as much of Sicily, are sparsely populated.\nThe population of Italy almost doubled during the 20th century, but the pattern of growth was extremely uneven because of large-scale internal migration from the rural South to the industrial cities of the North, a phenomenon which happened as a consequence of the Italian economic miracle of the 1950\u20131960s. High fertility and birth rates persisted until the 1970s, after which they started to decline. The population rapidly aged; by 2010, one in five Italians was over 65 years old, and the country currently has the fifth oldest population in the world, with a median age of 46.5 years.[272][363] However, in recent years Italy has experienced significant growth in birth rates.[364] The total fertility rate has also climbed from an all-time low of 1.18 children per woman in 1995 to 1.41 in 2008,[365] albeit still below the replacement rate of 2.1 and considerably below the high of 5.06 children born per woman in 1883.[366] Nevertheless, the total fertility rate is expected to reach 1.6\u20131.8 in 2030.[367]\nFrom the late 19th century until the 1960s Italy was a country of mass emigration. Between 1898 and 1914, the peak years of Italian diaspora, approximately 750,000 Italians emigrated each year.[368] The diaspora concerned more than 25 million Italians and it is considered the biggest mass migration of contemporary times.[369] As a result, today more than 4.1 million Italian citizens are living abroad,[370] while at least 60 million people of full or part Italian ancestry live outside of Italy, most notably in Argentina,[371] Brazil,[372] Uruguay,[373] Venezuela,[374] the United States,[375] Canada,[376] Australia[377] and France.[378]\nIn 2016, Italy had about 5.05 million foreign residents,[379] making up 8.3% of the total population. The figures include more than half a million children born in Italy to foreign nationals\u00a0(second generation immigrants) but exclude foreign nationals who have subsequently acquired Italian citizenship;[380] in 2016, about 201,000 people became Italian citizens.[381] The official figures also exclude illegal immigrants, who estimated to number at least 670,000 as of 2008.[382]\nStarting from the early 1980s, until then a linguistically and culturally homogeneous society, Italy begun to attract substantial flows of foreign immigrants.[383] After the fall of the Berlin Wall and, more recently, the 2004 and 2007 enlargements of the European Union, large waves of migration originated from the former socialist countries of Eastern Europe (especially Romania, Albania, Ukraine and Poland). Another source of immigration is neighbouring North Africa (in particular, Morocco, Egypt and Tunisia), with soaring arrivals as a consequence of the Arab Spring. Furthermore, in recent years, growing migration fluxes from Asia-Pacific (notably China[384] and the Philippines) and Latin America have been recorded.\nCurrently, about one million Romanian citizens (around 10% of them being ethnic Romani people[385]) are officially registered as living in Italy, representing the largest migrant population, followed by Albanians and Moroccans with about 500,000 people each. The number of unregistered Romanians is difficult to estimate, but the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network suggested in 2007 that there might have been half a million or more.[386][note 4]\nAs of 2010, the foreign born population of Italy was from the following regions: Europe (54%), Africa (22%), Asia (16%), the Americas (8%) and Oceania (0.06%). The distribution of foreign population is geographically varied in Italy: in 2020, 61.2% of foreign citizens lived in Northern Italy (in particular 36.1% in the North West and 25.1% in the North East), 24.2% in the centre, 10.8% in the South and 3.9% in the Islands.[388]\nItaly's official language is Italian, as stated by the framework law no. 482/1999[389] and Trentino Alto-Adige's special Statute,[390] which is adopted with a constitutional law. Around the world there are an estimated 64 million native Italian speakers[391][392][393] and another 21 million who use it as a second language.[394] Italian is often natively spoken in a regional variety, not to be confused with Italy's regional and minority languages;[395][396] however, the establishment of a national education system led to a decrease in variation in the languages spoken across the country during the 20th century. Standardisation was further expanded in the 1950s and 1960s due to economic growth and the rise of mass media and television (the state broadcaster RAI helped set a standard Italian).\nTwelve \"historical minority languages\" (minoranze linguistiche storiche) are formally recognised: Albanian, Catalan, German, Greek, Slovene, Croatian, French, Franco-Proven\u00e7al, Friulian, Ladin, Occitan and Sardinian.[389] Four of these also enjoy a co-official status in their respective region: French in the Aosta Valley;[397] German in South Tyrol, and Ladin as well in some parts of the same province and in parts of the neighbouring Trentino;[398] and Slovene in the provinces of Trieste, Gorizia and Udine.[399] A number of other Ethnologue, ISO and UNESCO languages are not recognised by Italian law. Like France, Italy has signed the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, but has not ratified it.[400]\nBecause of recent immigration, Italy has sizeable populations whose native language is not Italian, nor a regional language. According to the Italian National Institute of Statistics, Romanian is the most common mother tongue among foreign residents in Italy: almost 800,000 people speak Romanian as their first language (21.9% of the foreign residents aged 6 and over). Other prevalent mother tongues are Arabic (spoken by over 475,000 people; 13.1% of foreign residents), Albanian (380,000 people) and Spanish (255,000 people).[401]\nIn 2017, the proportion of Italians who identified themselves as Roman Catholic Christians was 74.4%.[402] Since 1985, Catholicism is no longer officially the state religion.[403] Italy has the world's fifth-largest Catholic population, and is the largest Catholic nation in Europe.[404]\nThe Holy See, the episcopal jurisdiction of Rome, contains the central government of the Catholic Church. It is recognised by other subjects of international law as a sovereign entity, headed by the Pope, who is also the Bishop of Rome, with which diplomatic relations can be maintained.[405][note 5] Often incorrectly referred to as \"the Vatican\", the Holy See is not the same entity as the Vatican City State because the Holy See is the jurisdiction and administrative entity of the Pope.[406] The Vatican City came into existence only in 1929.\nIn 2011, minority Christian faiths in Italy included an estimated 1.5 million Orthodox Christians, or 2.5% of the population;[407] 500,000 Pentecostals and Evangelicals (of whom 400,000 are members of the Assemblies of God), 251,192 Jehovah's Witnesses,[408] 30,000 Waldensians,[409] 25,000 Seventh-day Adventists, 26,925 Latter-day Saints, 15,000 Baptists (plus some 5,000 Free Baptists), 7,000 Lutherans, 4,000 Methodists (affiliated with the Waldensian Church).[410]\nOne of the longest-established minority religious faiths in Italy is Judaism, Jews having been present in Ancient Rome since before the birth of Christ. Italy has for centuries welcomed Jews expelled from other countries, notably Spain. However, about 20% of Italian Jews were killed during the Holocaust.[411] This, together with the emigration which preceded and followed World War II, has left only around 28,400 Jews in Italy.[412]\nSoaring immigration in the last two decades has been accompanied by an increase in non-Christian faiths. Following immigration from the Indian subcontinent, in Italy there are 120,000 Hindus,[413] 70,000 Sikhs and 22 gurdwaras across the country.[414]\nThe Italian state, as a measure to protect religious freedom, devolves shares of income tax to recognised religious communities, under a regime known as Eight per thousand. Donations are allowed to Christian, Jewish, Buddhist and Hindu communities; however, Islam remains excluded, since no Muslim communities have yet signed a concordat with the Italian state.[415] Taxpayers who do not wish to fund a religion contribute their share to the state welfare system.[416]\nEducation in Italy is free and mandatory from ages six to sixteen,[417] and consists of five stages: kindergarten (scuola dell'infanzia), primary school (scuola primaria), lower secondary school (scuola secondaria di primo grado), upper secondary school (scuola secondaria di secondo grado) and university (universit\u00e0).[418]\nPrimary education lasts eight years. Students are given a basic education in Italian, English, mathematics, natural sciences, history, geography, social studies, physical education and visual and musical arts. Secondary education lasts for five years and includes three traditional types of schools focused on different academic levels: the liceo prepares students for university studies with a classical or scientific curriculum, while the istituto tecnico and the Istituto professionale prepare pupils for vocational education.\nIn 2018, the Italian secondary education was evaluated as below the OECD average.[419] Italy scored below the OECD average in reading and science, and near OECD average in mathematics. Mean performance in Italy declined in reading and science, and remained stable in mathematics.[419] Trento and Bolzano scored at an above the national average in reading.[419] Compared to school children in other OECD countries, children in Italy missed out on a greater amount of learning due to absences and indiscipline in classrooms.[420] A wide gap exists between northern schools, which perform near average, and schools in the South, that had much poorer results.[421]\nTertiary education in Italy is divided between public universities, private universities and the prestigious and selective superior graduate schools, such as the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa. 33 Italian universities were ranked among the world's top 500 in 2019, the third-largest number in Europe after the United Kingdom and Germany.[422] Bologna University, founded in 1088, is the oldest university in continuous operation,[423] as well as one of the leading academic institutions in Italy and Europe.[424] The Bocconi University, Universit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, LUISS, Polytechnic University of Turin, Polytechnic University of Milan, Sapienza University of Rome, and University of Milan are also ranked among the best in the world.[425]\nLife expectancy in the country is 80 for males and 85 for females, placing the country 5th in the world for life expectancy.[427] In comparison to other Western countries, Italy has a relatively low rate of adult obesity (below 10%[428]), as there are several health benefits of the Mediterranean diet.[429] The proportion of daily smokers was 22% in 2012, down from 24.4% in 2000 but still slightly above the OECD average.[430] Smoking in public places including bars, restaurants, night clubs and offices has been restricted to specially ventilated rooms since 2005.[431] In 2013, UNESCO added the Mediterranean diet to the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of Italy (promoter), Morocco, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Cyprus and Croatia.[432][433]\nThe Italian state runs a universal public healthcare system since 1978.[434] However, healthcare is provided to all citizens and residents by a mixed public-private system. The public part is the Servizio Sanitario Nazionale, which is organised under the Ministry of Health and administered on a devolved regional basis. Healthcare spending accounted for 9.7% of GDP in 2020.[435] Italy's healthcare system is consistently ranked among the best in the world.[436][437] In 2018 Italy's healthcare is ranked 20th in Europe in the Euro Health Consumer Index.\nItaly is considered one of the birthplaces of western civilization and a cultural superpower.[438] Divided by politics and geography for centuries until its eventual unification in 1861, Italy's culture has been shaped by a multitude of regional customs and local centres of power and patronage.[439] Italy has had a central role in Western culture for centuries and is still recognised for its cultural traditions and artists. During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, a number of courts competed to attract architects, artists and scholars, thus producing a legacy of monuments, paintings, music and literature. Despite the political and social isolation of these courts, Italy has made a substantial contribution to the cultural and historical heritage of Europe.[440]\nItaly has rich collections of art, culture and literature from many periods. The country has had a broad cultural influence worldwide, also because numerous Italians emigrated to other places during the Italian diaspora. Furthermore, Italy has, overall, an estimated 100,000 monuments of any sort (museums, palaces, buildings, statues, churches, art galleries, villas, fountains, historic houses and archaeological remains),[441] and according to some estimates the nation is home to half the world's art treasures.[442]\nItaly is known for its considerable architectural achievements,[443] such as the construction of arches, domes and similar structures during ancient Rome, the founding of the Renaissance architectural movement in the late-14th to 16th centuries, and being the homeland of Palladianism, a style of construction which inspired movements such as that of Neoclassical architecture, and influenced the designs which noblemen built their country houses all over the world, notably in the UK, Australia and the US during the late 17th to early 20th centuries.\nAlong with pre-historic architecture, the first people in Italy to truly begin a sequence of designs were the Greeks and the Etruscans, progressing to classical Roman,[444] then to the revival of the classical Roman era during the Renaissance and evolving into the Baroque era. The Christian concept of a Basilica, a style of church architecture that came to dominate the early Middle Ages, was invented in Rome. They were known for being long, rectangular buildings, which were built in an almost ancient Roman style, often rich in mosaics and decorations. The early Christians' art and architecture were also widely inspired by that of the pagan Romans; statues, mosaics and paintings decorated all their churches.[445] The first significant buildings in the medieval Romanesque style were churches built in Italy during the 800s. Byzantine architecture was also widely diffused in Italy. The Byzantines kept Roman principles of architecture and art alive, and the most famous structure from this period is the Basilica of St Mark in Venice.\nThe Romanesque movement, which went from approximately 800 AD to 1100 AD, was one of the most fruitful and creative periods in Italian architecture, when several masterpieces, such as the Leaning Tower of Pisa in the Piazza dei Miracoli, and the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio in Milan were built. It was known for its usage of Roman arches, stained glass windows, and also its curved columns which commonly featured in cloisters. The main innovation of Italian Romanesque architecture was the vault, which had never been seen before in the history of Western architecture.[446]\nA flowering of Italian architecture took place during the Renaissance. Filippo Brunelleschi contributed to architectural design with his dome for the Cathedral of Florence, a feat of engineering that had not been accomplished since antiquity.[447] A popular achievement of Italian Renaissance architecture was St. Peter's Basilica, originally designed by Donato Bramante in the early 16th century. Also, Andrea Palladio influenced architects throughout Western Europe with the villas and palaces he designed in the middle and late 16th century; the city of Vicenza, with its twenty-three buildings designed by Palladio, and twenty-four Palladian Villas of the Veneto are listed by UNESCO as part of a World Heritage Site named City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto.[448]\nThe Baroque period produced several outstanding Italian architects in the 17th century, especially those known for their churches. The most original work of all late Baroque and Rococo architecture is the Palazzina di caccia di Stupinigi, dating back to the 18th century.[449] Luigi Vanvitelli began in 1752 the construction of the Royal Palace of Caserta. In this large complex, the grandiose Baroque-style interiors and gardens are opposed to a more sober building envelope.[450] In the late 18th and early 19th centuries Italy was affected by the Neoclassical architectural movement. Villas, palaces, gardens, interiors and art began to be based on Roman and Greek themes.[451]\nDuring the Fascist period, the so-called \"Novecento movement\" flourished, based on the rediscovery of imperial Rome, with figures such as Gio Ponti and Giovanni Muzio. Marcello Piacentini, responsible for the urban transformations of several cities in Italy and remembered for the disputed Via della Conciliazione in Rome, devised a form of simplified Neoclassicism.[452]\nThe history of Italian visual arts is significant to the history of Western painting. Roman art was influenced by Greece and can in part be taken as a descendant of ancient Greek painting. Roman painting does have its own unique characteristics. The only surviving Roman paintings are wall paintings, many from villas in Campania, in Southern Italy. Such paintings can be grouped into four main \"styles\" or periods[453] and may contain the first examples of trompe-l'\u0153il, pseudo-perspective, and pure landscape.[454]\nPanel painting becomes more common during the Romanesque period, under the heavy influence of Byzantine icons. Towards the middle of the 13th century, Medieval art and Gothic painting became more realistic, with the beginnings of interest in the depiction of volume and perspective in Italy with Cimabue and then his pupil Giotto. From Giotto onwards, the treatment of composition in painting became much more free and innovative.\nThe Italian Renaissance is said by many to be the golden age of painting; roughly spanning the 14th through the mid-17th centuries with a significant influence also out of the borders of modern Italy. In Italy artists like Paolo Uccello, Fra Angelico, Masaccio, Piero della Francesca, Andrea Mantegna, Filippo Lippi, Giorgione, Tintoretto, Sandro Botticelli, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo Buonarroti, Raphael, Giovanni Bellini, and Titian took painting to a higher level through the use of perspective, the study of human anatomy and proportion, and through their development of refined drawing and painting techniques. Michelangelo was active as a sculptor from about 1500 to 1520; his works include his David, Piet\u00e0, Moses. Other Renaissance sculptors include Lorenzo Ghiberti, Luca Della Robbia, Donatello, Filippo Brunelleschi and Andrea del Verrocchio.\nIn the 15th and 16th centuries, the High Renaissance gave rise to a stylised art known as Mannerism. In place of the balanced compositions and rational approach to perspective that characterised art at the dawn of the 16th century, the Mannerists sought instability, artifice, and doubt. The unperturbed faces and gestures of Piero della Francesca and the calm Virgins of Raphael are replaced by the troubled expressions of Pontormo and the emotional intensity of El Greco.\nIn the 17th century, among the greatest painters of Italian Baroque are Caravaggio, Annibale Carracci, Artemisia Gentileschi, Mattia Preti, Carlo Saraceni and Bartolomeo Manfredi. Subsequently, in the 18th century, Italian Rococo was mainly inspired by French Rococo, since France was the founding nation of that particular style, with artists such as Giovanni Battista Tiepolo and Canaletto. Italian Neoclassical sculpture focused, with Antonio Canova's nudes, on the idealist aspect of the movement.\nIn the 19th century, major Italian Romantic painters were Francesco Hayez, Giuseppe Bezzuoli and Francesco Podesti. Impressionism was brought from France to Italy by the Macchiaioli, led by Giovanni Fattori, and Giovanni Boldini; Realism by Gioacchino Toma and Giuseppe Pellizza da Volpedo. In the 20th century, with Futurism, primarily through the works of Umberto Boccioni and Giacomo Balla, Italy rose again as a seminal country for artistic evolution in painting and sculpture. Futurism was succeeded by the metaphysical paintings of Giorgio de Chirico, who exerted a strong influence on the Surrealists and generations of artists to follow like Bruno Caruso and Renato Guttuso.\nFormal Latin literature began in 240 BC, when the first stage play was performed in Rome.[455] Latin literature was, and still is, highly influential in the world, with numerous writers, poets, philosophers, and historians, such as Pliny the Elder, Pliny the Younger, Virgil, Horace, Propertius, Ovid and Livy. The Romans were also famous for their oral tradition, poetry, drama and epigrams.[456] In early years of the 13th century, Francis of Assisi was considered the first Italian poet by literary critics, with his religious song Canticle of the Sun.[457]\nAnother Italian voice originated in Sicily. At the court of Emperor Frederick II, who ruled the Sicilian kingdom during the first half of the 13th century, lyrics modelled on Proven\u00e7al forms and themes were written in a refined version of the local vernacular. One of these poets was the notary Giacomo da Lentini, inventor of the sonnet form, though the most famous early sonneteer was Petrarch.[458]\nGuido Guinizelli is considered the founder of the Dolce Stil Novo, a school that added a philosophical dimension to traditional love poetry. This new understanding of love, expressed in a smooth, pure style, influenced Guido Cavalcanti and the Florentine poet Dante Alighieri, who established the basis of the modern Italian language; his greatest work, the Divine Comedy, is considered among the foremost literary statements produced in Europe during the Middle Ages; furthermore, the poet invented the difficult terza rima. Two major writers of the 14th century, Petrarch and Giovanni Boccaccio, sought out and imitated the works of antiquity and cultivated their own artistic personalities. Petrarch achieved fame through his collection of poems, Il Canzoniere. Petrarch's love poetry served as a model for centuries. Equally influential was Boccaccio's The Decameron, one of the most popular collections of short stories ever written.[459]\nItalian Renaissance authors produced works including Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli's The Prince, an essay on political science and modern philosophy in which the \"effectual truth\" is taken to be more important than any abstract ideal; Ludovico Ariosto's Orlando Furioso, continuation of Matteo Maria Boiardo's unfinished romance Orlando Innamorato; and Baldassare Castiglione's dialogue The Book of the Courtier which describes the ideal of the perfect court gentleman and of spiritual beauty. The lyric poet Torquato Tasso in Jerusalem Delivered wrote a Christian epic in ottava rima, with attention to the Aristotelian canons of unity.\nGiovanni Francesco Straparola and Giambattista Basile, who have written The Facetious Nights of Straparola (1550\u20131555) and the Pentamerone (1634) respectively, printed some of the first known versions of fairy tales in Europe.[460][461][462] In the early 17th century, some literary masterpieces were created, such as Giambattista Marino's long mythological poem, L'Adone. The Baroque period also produced the clear scientific prose of Galileo as well as Tommaso Campanella's The City of the Sun, a description of a perfect society ruled by a philosopher-priest. At the end of the 17th century, the Arcadians began a movement to restore simplicity and classical restraint to poetry, as in Metastasio's heroic melodramas. In the 18th century, playwright Carlo Goldoni created full-written plays, many portraying the middle class of his day.\nRomanticism coincided with some ideas of the Risorgimento, the patriotic movement that brought Italy political unity and freedom from foreign domination. Italian writers embraced Romanticism in the early 19th century. The time of Italy's rebirth was heralded by the poets Vittorio Alfieri, Ugo Foscolo, and Giacomo Leopardi. The works by Alessandro Manzoni, the leading Italian Romantic, are a symbol of the Italian unification for their patriotic message and because of his efforts in the development of the modern, unified Italian language; his novel The Betrothed was the first Italian historical novel to glorify Christian values of justice and Providence, and it has been called the most famous and widely read novel in the Italian language.[465]\nIn the late 19th century, a realistic literary movement called Verismo played a major role in Italian literature; Giovanni Verga and Luigi Capuana were its main exponents. In the same period, Emilio Salgari, writer of action-adventure swashbucklers and a pioneer of science fiction, published his Sandokan series.[466] In 1883, Carlo Collodi also published the novel The Adventures of Pinocchio, the most celebrated children's classic by an Italian author and one of the most translated non-religious books in the world.[463] A movement called Futurism influenced Italian literature in the early 20th century. Filippo Tommaso Marinetti wrote Manifesto of Futurism, called for the use of language and metaphors that glorified the speed, dynamism, and violence of the machine age.[467]\nModern literary figures and Nobel laureates are Gabriele D'Annunzio from 1889 to 1910, nationalist poet Giosu\u00e8 Carducci in 1906, realist writer Grazia Deledda in 1926, modern theatre author Luigi Pirandello in 1936, short stories writer Italo Calvino in 1960, poets Salvatore Quasimodo in 1959 and Eugenio Montale in 1975, Umberto Eco in 1980, and satirist and theatre author Dario Fo in 1997.[468]\nOver the ages, Italian philosophy and literature had a vast influence on Western philosophy, beginning with the Greeks and Romans, and going onto Renaissance humanism, the Age of Enlightenment and modern philosophy.[469] Philosophy was brought to Italy by Pythagoras, founder of the Italian school of philosophy in Crotone, Magna Graecia.[470] Major Italian philosophers of the Greek period include Xenophanes, Parmenides, Zeno, Empedocles and Gorgias. Roman philosophers include Cicero, Lucretius, Seneca the Younger, Musonius Rufus, Plutarch, Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius, Clement of Alexandria, Sextus Empiricus, Alexander of Aphrodisias, Plotinus, Porphyry, Iamblichus, Augustine of Hippo, Philoponus of Alexandria and Boethius.[469]\nItalian Medieval philosophy was mainly Christian, and included philosophers and theologians such as Thomas Aquinas, the foremost classical proponent of natural theology and the father of Thomism, who reintroduced Aristotelian philosophy to Christianity.[475] Notable Renaissance philosophers include: Giordano Bruno, one of the major scientific figures of the western world; Marsilio Ficino, one of the most influential humanist philosophers of the period; and Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, one of the main founders of modern political science. Machiavelli's most famous work was The Prince, whose contribution to the history of political thought is the fundamental break between political realism and political idealism.[476] Italy was also affected by the Enlightenment, a movement which was a consequence of the Renaissance.[477] University cities such as Padua, Bologna and Naples remained centres of scholarship and the intellect, with several philosophers such as Giambattista Vico (widely regarded as being the founder of modern Italian philosophy)[478] and Antonio Genovesi.[477] Cesare Beccaria was a significant Enlightenment figure and is now considered one of the fathers of classical criminal theory as well as modern penology.[473] Beccaria is famous for his On Crimes and Punishments (1764), a treatise that served as one of the earliest prominent condemnations of torture and the death penalty and thus a landmark work in anti-death penalty philosophy.[477]\nItaly also had a renowned philosophical movement in the 1800s, with Idealism, Sensism and Empiricism. The main Sensist Italian philosophers were Melchiorre Gioja and Gian Domenico Romagnosi.[478] Criticism of the Sensist movement came from other philosophers such as Pasquale Galluppi (1770\u20131846), who affirmed that a priori relationships were synthetic.[478] Antonio Rosmini, instead, was the founder of Italian idealism. During the late 19th and 20th centuries, there were also several other movements which gained some form of popularity in Italy, such as Ontologism (whose main philosopher was Vincenzo Gioberti),[479] anarchism, communism, socialism, futurism, fascism and Christian democracy. Giovanni Gentile and Benedetto Croce were two of the most significant 20th-century Idealist philosophers. Anarcho-communism first fully formed into its modern strain within the Italian section of the First International.[480] Antonio Gramsci remains a relevant philosopher within Marxist and communist theory, credited with creating the theory of cultural hegemony. Italian philosophers were also influential in the development of the non-Marxist liberal socialism philosophy, including Carlo Rosselli, Norberto Bobbio, Piero Gobetti and Aldo Capitini. In the 1960s, many Italian left-wing activists adopted the anti-authoritarian pro-working class leftist theories that would become known as autonomism and operaismo.[481]\nEarly Italian feminists include Sibilla Aleramo, Alaide Gualberta Beccari, and Anna Maria Mozzoni, though proto-feminist philosophies had previously been touched upon by earlier Italian writers such as Christine de Pizan, Moderata Fonte, and Lucrezia Marinella. Italian physician and educator Maria Montessori is credited with the creation of the philosophy of education that bears her name, an educational philosophy now practised throughout the world.[474] Giuseppe Peano was one of the founders of analytic philosophy and the contemporary philosophy of mathematics. Recent analytic philosophers include Carlo Penco, Gloria Origgi, Pieranna Garavaso and Luciano Floridi.[469]\nItalian theatre originates from the Middle Ages, with its background dating back to the times of the ancient Greek colonies of Magna Graecia, in Southern Italy,[483] the theatre of the Italic peoples[484] and the theatre of ancient Rome. It can therefore be assumed that there were two main lines of which the ancient Italian theatre developed in the Middle Ages. The first, consisting of the dramatization of Catholic liturgies and of which more documentation is retained, and the second, formed by pagan forms of spectacle such as the staging for city festivals, the court preparations of the jesters and the songs of the troubadours.[485] The Renaissance theatre marked the beginning of the modern theatre due to the rediscovery and study of the classics, the ancient theatrical texts were recovered and translated, which were soon staged at the court and in the curtensi halls, and then moved to real theatre. In this way the idea of \u200b\u200btheatre came close to that of today: a performance in a designated place in which the public participates. In the late 15th century two cities were important centres for the rediscovery and renewal of theatrical art: Ferrara and Rome. The first, vital centre of art in the second half of the fifteenth century, saw the staging of some of the most famous Latin works by Plautus, rigorously translated into Italian.[486]\nDuring the 16th century and on into the 18th century, Commedia dell'arte was a form of improvisational theatre, and it is still performed today. Travelling troupes of players would set up an outdoor stage and provide amusement in the form of juggling, acrobatics and, more typically, humorous plays based on a repertoire of established characters with a rough storyline, called canovaccio. Plays did not originate from written drama but from scenarios called lazzi, which were loose frameworks that provided the situations, complications, and outcome of the action, around which the actors would improvise. The characters of the commedia usually represent fixed social types and stock characters, each of which has a distinct costume, such as foolish old men, devious servants, or military officers full of false bravado. The main categories of these characters include servants, old men, lovers, and captains.[487]\nThe first recorded Commedia dell'arte performances came from Rome as early as 1551,[488] and was performed outdoors in temporary venues by professional actors who were costumed and masked, as opposed to commedia erudita, which were written comedies, presented indoors by untrained and unmasked actors.[489] By the mid-16th century, specific troupes of commedia performers began to coalesce, and by 1568 the Gelosi became a distinct company. Commedia often performed inside in court theatres or halls, and also in some fixed theatres such as Teatro Baldrucca in Florence. Flaminio Scala, who had been a minor performer in the Gelosi published the scenarios of the Commedia dell'arte around the start of the 17th century, really in an effort to legitimise the form\u2014and ensure its legacy. These scenari are highly structured and built around the symmetry of the various types in duet: two zanni, vecchi, inamorate and inamorati, among others.[490]\nIn Commedia dell'arte, female roles were played by women, documented as early as the 1560s, making them the first known professional actresses in Europe since antiquity. Lucrezia Di Siena, whose name is on a contract of actors from 10 October 1564, has been referred to as the first Italian actress known by name, with Vincenza Armani and Barbara Flaminia as the first primadonnas and the first well-documented actresses in Europe.[494]\nThe Ballet dance genre also originated in Italy. It began during the Italian Renaissance court as an outgrowth of court pageantry,[495] where aristocratic weddings were lavish celebrations. Court musicians and dancers collaborated to provide elaborate entertainment for them.[496] Domenico da Piacenza was one of the first dancing masters. Along with his students, Antonio Cornazzano and Guglielmo Ebreo, he was trained in dance and responsible for teaching nobles the art. Da Piacenza left one work: De arte saltandi et choreus ducendi (On the art of dancing and conducting dances), which was put together by his students.\nAt first, ballets were woven into the midst of an opera to allow the audience a moment of relief from the dramatic intensity. By the mid-seventeenth century, Italian ballets in their entirety were performed in between the acts of an opera. Over time, Italian ballets became part of theatrical life: ballet companies in Italy's major opera houses employed an average of four to twelve dancers; in 1815 many companies employed anywhere from eighty to one hundred dancers.[497]\nCarlo Goldoni, who wrote a few scenarios starting in 1734, superseded the comedy of masks and the comedy of intrigue by representations of actual life and manners through the characters and their behaviours. He rightly maintained that Italian life and manners were susceptible of artistic treatment such as had not been given them before. Italian theatre has been active in producing contemporary European work and in staging revivals, including the works of Luigi Pirandello and Dario Fo.\nThe Teatro di San Carlo in Naples is the oldest continuously active venue for public opera in the world, opening in 1737, decades before both Milan's La Scala and Venice's La Fenice theatres.[482]\nFrom folk music to classical, music is an intrinsic part of Italian culture. Instruments associated with classical music, including the piano and violin, were invented in Italy,[500][501] and many of the prevailing classical music forms, such as the symphony, concerto, and sonata, can trace their roots back to innovations of 16th- and 17th-century Italian music.\nItaly's most famous composers include the Renaissance composers Palestrina, Monteverdi and Gesualdo, the Baroque composers Scarlatti, Corelli and Vivaldi, the Classical composers Paisiello, Paganini and Rossini, and the Romantic composers Verdi and Puccini. Modern Italian composers such as Berio and Nono proved significant in the development of experimental and electronic music. While the classical music tradition still holds strong in Italy, as evidenced by the fame of its innumerable opera houses, such as La Scala of Milan and San Carlo of Naples (the oldest continuously active venue for public opera in the world),[482] and performers such as the pianist Maurizio Pollini and tenor Luciano Pavarotti, Italians have been no less appreciative of their thriving contemporary music scene.\nItaly is widely known for being the birthplace of opera.[503] Italian opera was believed to have been founded in the early 17th century, in cities such as Mantua and Venice.[503] Later, works and pieces composed by native Italian composers of the 19th and early 20th centuries, such as Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, Verdi and Puccini, are among the most famous operas ever written and today are performed in opera houses across the world. La Scala opera house in Milan is also renowned as one of the best in the world. Famous Italian opera singers include Enrico Caruso and Alessandro Bonci.\nIntroduced in the early 1920s, jazz took a particularly strong foothold in Italy, and remained popular despite the xenophobic cultural policies of the Fascist regime. Today, the most notable centres of jazz music in Italy include Milan, Rome, and Sicily. Later, Italy was at the forefront of the progressive rock and pop movement of the 1970s, with bands like PFM, Banco del Mutuo Soccorso, Le Orme, Goblin, and Pooh.[504] The same period saw diversification in the cinema of Italy, and Cinecitt\u00e0 films included complex scores by composers including Ennio Morricone, Armando Trovaioli, Piero Piccioni and Piero Umiliani. In the early 1980s, the first star to emerge from the Italian hip hop scene was singer Jovanotti.[505] Italian metal bands include Rhapsody of Fire, Lacuna Coil, Elvenking, Forgotten Tomb, and Fleshgod Apocalypse.\nItaly contributed to the development of disco and electronic music, with Italo disco, known for its futuristic sound and prominent use of synthesisers and drum machines, being one of the earliest electronic dance genres, as well as European forms of disco aside from Euro disco (which later went on to influence several genres such as Eurodance and Nu-disco).[507] By the latter half of the 1990s, a subgenre of Eurodance known as Italo dance emerged. Taking influences from Italo disco and Italo house, Italo dance generally included synthesizer riffs, a melodic sound, and the usage of vocoders. Notable Italian DJs and remixers include Gabry Ponte (member of the group Eiffel 65), Benny Benassi, Gigi D'Agostino, and the trio Tacabro.\nProducers such as Giorgio Moroder, who won three Academy Awards and four Golden Globes for his music, were highly influential in the development of electronic dance music.[506] Today, Italian pop music is represented annually with the Sanremo Music Festival, which served as inspiration for the Eurovision song contest, and the Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto.[508] Singers such as Mina, Andrea Bocelli, Grammy winner Laura Pausini, Zucchero, Eros Ramazzotti, Elisa, Tiziano Ferro and Mahmood have attained international acclaim.\nGigliola Cinquetti, Toto Cutugno, and M\u00e5neskin won the Eurovision Song Contest, in 1964, 1990, and 2021 respectively.\nThe history of Italian cinema began a few months after the Lumi\u00e8re brothers began motion picture exhibitions.[511][512] The first Italian director is considered to be Vittorio Calcina, a collaborator of the Lumi\u00e8re Brothers, who filmed Pope Leo XIII in 1896.[513] In the 1910s the Italian film industry developed rapidly.[514] In 1912, the year of the greatest expansion, 569 films were produced in Turin, 420 in Rome and 120 in Milan.[515] Cabiria, a 1914 Italian epic film directed by Giovanni Pastrone, is considered the most famous Italian silent film.[514][516] It was also the first film in history to be shown in the White House.[517][518][519] The oldest European avant-garde cinema movement, Italian futurism, took place in the late 1910s.[520]\nAfter a period of decline in the 1920s, the Italian film industry was revitalized in the 1930s with the arrival of sound film. A popular Italian genre during this period, the Telefoni Bianchi, consisted of comedies with glamorous backgrounds.[521] Calligrafismo was instead in a sharp contrast to Telefoni Bianchi-American style comedies and is rather artistic, highly formalistic, expressive in complexity and deals mainly with contemporary literary material.[522] Cinema was later used by Benito Mussolini, who founded Rome's renowned Cinecitt\u00e0 studio also for the production of Fascist propaganda until World War II.[523]\nAfter the war, Italian film was widely recognised and exported until an artistic decline around the 1980s.[524] Notable Italian film directors from this period include Vittorio De Sica, Federico Fellini, Sergio Leone, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Luchino Visconti, Michelangelo Antonioni, Dussio Tessari and Roberto Rossellini; some of these are recognised among the greatest and most influential filmmakers of all time.[525][526] Movies include world cinema treasures such as Bicycle Thieves, La dolce vita, 8\u00bd, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, and Once Upon a Time in the West. The mid-1940s to the early 1950s was the heyday of neorealist films, reflecting the poor condition of post-war Italy.[527][528]\nAs the country grew wealthier in the 1950s, a form of neorealism known as pink neorealism succeeded, and starting from the 1950s through the Commedia all'italiana genre, and other film genres, such as sword-and-sandal followed as Spaghetti Westerns, were popular in the 1960s and 1970s.[529] Actresses such as Sophia Loren, Giulietta Masina and Gina Lollobrigida achieved international stardom during this period. Erotic Italian thrillers, or giallos, produced by directors such as Mario Bava and Dario Argento in the 1970s, also influenced the horror genre worldwide.[530] In recent years, the Italian scene has received only occasional international attention, with movies like Cinema Paradiso written and directed by Giuseppe Tornatore, Mediterraneo directed by Gabriele Salvatores, Life Is Beautiful directed by Roberto Benigni, Il Postino: The Postman with Massimo Troisi and The Great Beauty directed by Paolo Sorrentino.[531]\nThe aforementioned Cinecitt\u00e0 studio is today the largest film and television production facility in Europe,[509] where many international box office hits were filmed. In the 1950s, the number of international productions being made there led to Rome's being dubbed \"Hollywood on the Tiber\". More than 3,000 productions have been made on its lot, of which 90 received an Academy Award nomination and 47 of these won it, from some cinema classics to recent rewarded features (such as Roman Holiday, Ben-Hur, Cleopatra, Romeo and Juliet, The English Patient, The Passion of the Christ, and Gangs of New York).[532]\nItaly is the most awarded country at the Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film, with 14 awards won, 3 Special Awards and 28 nominations.[533] As of 2016[update], Italian films have also won 12 Palmes d'Or,[534] 11 Golden Lions[535] and 7 Golden Bears.[536]\nThe most popular sport in Italy is football.[537][538] Italy's national football team is one of the world's most successful teams with four FIFA World Cup victories (1934, 1938, 1982 and 2006).[539] Italian clubs have won 48 major European trophies, making Italy the second most successful country in European football. Italy's top-flight club football league is named Serie A and is followed by millions of fans around the world.[540]\nOther popular team sports in Italy include basketball, volleyball and rugby.[541] Italy's male and female national volleyball teams are often featured among the world's best. The Italian national basketball team's best results were gold at Eurobasket 1983 and EuroBasket 1999, as well as silver at the Olympics in 2004. Lega Basket Serie A is widely considered one of the most competitive in Europe.[542] Italy's rugby national team competes in the Six Nations Championship, and is a regular at the Rugby World Cup. The men's volleyball team won three consecutive World Championships (in 1990, 1994, and 1998) and earned the Olympic silver medal in 1996, 2004, and 2016.\nItaly has a long and successful tradition in individual sports as well. Bicycle racing is a familiar sport in the country.[544] Italians have won the UCI World Championships more than any other country, except Belgium. The Giro d'Italia is a cycling race held every May and constitutes one of the three Grand Tours. Alpine skiing is also a widespread sport in Italy, and the country is a popular international skiing destination, known for its ski resorts.[545] Italian skiers achieved good results in Winter Olympic Games, Alpine Ski World Cup, and tennis has a significant following in Italy, ranking as the fourth most practised sport in the country.[546] The Rome Masters, founded in 1930, is one of the most prestigious tennis tournaments in the world.[547] Italian professional tennis players won the Davis Cup in 1976 and the Fed Cup in 2006, 2009, 2010 and 2013.\nMotorsports are also extremely popular in Italy.[541] Italy has won, by far, the most MotoGP World Championships. Italian Scuderia Ferrari is the oldest surviving team in Grand Prix racing,[548] having competed since 1948, and statistically the most successful Formula One team in history with a record of 232 wins. The Italian Grand Prix of Formula 1 is the fifth oldest surviving Grand Prix, having been held since 1921.[549] It is also one of the two Grand Prix present in every championship since the first one in 1950.[550] Every Formula 1 Grand Prix (except for the 1980) has been held at Autodromo Nazionale Monza.[551] Formula 1 was also held at Imola (1980\u20132006, 2020) and Mugello (2020). Other successful Italian car manufacturers in motorsports are Alfa Romeo, Lancia, Maserati and Fiat.[552]\nHistorically, Italy has been successful in the Olympic Games, taking part from the first Olympiad and in 47 Games out of 48, not having officially participated in the 1904 Summer Olympics.[553] Italian sportsmen have won 522 medals at the Summer Olympic Games, and another 106 at the Winter Olympic Games, for a combined total of 628 medals with 235 golds, which makes them the fifth most successful nation in Olympic history for total medals. The country hosted two Winter Olympics and will host a third (in 1956, 2006, and 2026), and one Summer games (in 1960).\nItalian fashion has a long tradition. Milan, Florence and Rome are Italy's main fashion capitals. According to Top Global Fashion Capital Rankings 2013 by Global Language Monitor, Rome ranked sixth worldwide while Milan was twelfth. Previously, in 2009, Milan was declared the \"fashion capital of the world\" by Global Language Monitor itself.[554] Major Italian fashion labels, such as Gucci, Armani, Prada, Versace, Valentino, Dolce & Gabbana, Missoni, Fendi, Moschino, Max Mara, Trussardi, and Ferragamo, to name a few, are regarded as among the finest fashion houses in the world. Jewellers like Bvlgari, Damiani and Buccellati have been founded in Italy. Also, the fashion magazine Vogue Italia, is considered one of the most prestigious fashion magazines in the world.[555] The talent of young, creative fashion is also promoted, as in the ITS young fashion designer competition in Trieste.[556]\nItaly is also prominent in the field of design, notably interior design, architectural design, industrial design and urban design. The country has produced some well-known furniture designers, such as Gio Ponti and Ettore Sottsass, and Italian phrases such as \"Bel Disegno\" and \"Linea Italiana\" have entered the vocabulary of furniture design.[557] Examples of classic pieces of Italian white goods and pieces of furniture include Zanussi's washing machines and fridges,[558] the \"New Tone\" sofas by Atrium,[558] and the post-modern bookcase by Ettore Sottsass, inspired by Bob Dylan's song \"Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again\".[558] Today, Milan and Turin are the nation's leaders in architectural design and industrial design. The city of Milan hosts Fiera Milano, Europe's largest design fair.[559] Milan also hosts major design and architecture-related events and venues, such as the \"Fuori Salone\" and the Salone del Mobile, and has been home to the designers Bruno Munari, Lucio Fontana, Enrico Castellani and Piero Manzoni.[560]\nThe Italian cuisine has developed through centuries of social and political changes, with roots as far back as the 4th century BC. Italian cuisine in itself takes heavy influences, including Etruscan, ancient Greek, ancient Roman, Byzantine, and Jewish.[561] Significant changes occurred with the discovery of the New World with the introduction of items such as potatoes, tomatoes, bell peppers and maize, now central to the cuisine but not introduced in quantity until the 18th century.[562][563] Italian cuisine is noted for its regional diversity,[564][565][566] abundance of difference in taste, and is known to be one of the most popular in the world,[567] wielding strong influence abroad.[568]\nThe Mediterranean diet forms the basis of Italian cuisine, rich in pasta, fish, fruits and vegetables and characterised by its extreme simplicity and variety, with many dishes having only four to eight ingredients.[569] Italian cooks rely chiefly on the quality of the ingredients rather than on elaborate preparation.[570] Dishes and recipes are often derivatives from local and familial tradition rather than created by chefs, so many recipes are ideally suited for home cooking, this being one of the main reasons behind the ever-increasing worldwide popularity of Italian cuisine, from America[571] to Asia.[572] Ingredients and dishes vary widely by region.\nItalian cuisine relies heavily on traditional products; the country has a large number of traditional specialities protected under EU law.[573] Cheese, cold cuts and wine are central to Italian cuisine, with many regional declinations and Protected Designation of Origin or Protected Geographical Indication labels, and along with pizza and coffee (especially espresso) form part of Italian gastronomic culture.[574] Desserts have a long tradition of merging local flavours such as citrus fruits, pistachio and almonds with sweet cheeses like mascarpone and ricotta or exotic tastes as cocoa, vanilla and cinnamon. Gelato,[575] tiramis\u00f9[576] and cassata are among the most famous examples of Italian desserts, cakes and patisserie.\nItalian meal structure is typical of the European Mediterranean region and differs from North, Central, and Eastern European meal structure, though it still often consists of breakfast (colazione), lunch (pranzo), and dinner (cena).[577] However, much less emphasis is placed on breakfast, and breakfast itself is often skipped or involves lighter meal portions than are seen in non-Mediterranean Western countries.[578] Late-morning and mid-afternoon snacks, called merenda (plural merende), are also often included in this meal structure.[579]\nThe marketing phenomenon consisting of words and images, colour combinations (the Italian tricolour) and geographical references for brands that are evocative of Italy to promote and market agri-food products that have nothing to do with Italian cuisine is known by the name of Italian Sounding.[580]\nPublic holidays celebrated in Italy include religious, national and regional observances. Italy's National Day, the Festa della Repubblica (Republic Day),[581] is celebrated on 2 June each year, with the main celebration taking place in Rome, and commemorates the birth of the Italian Republic in 1946.[582] The ceremony of the event organized in Rome includes the deposition of a laurel wreath as a tribute to the Italian Unknown Soldier at the Altare della Patria by the President of the Italian Republic and a military parade along Via dei Fori Imperiali in Rome.\nThe Saint Lucy's Day, which takes place on 13 December, is popular among children in some Italian regions, where she plays a role similar to Santa Claus.[583] In addition, the Epiphany in Italy is associated with the folkloristic figure of the Befana, a broomstick-riding old woman who, in the night between 5 and 6 January, bringing good children gifts and sweets, and bad ones charcoal or bags of ashes.[584] The Assumption of Mary coincides with Ferragosto on 15 August, the summer vacation period which may be a long weekend or most of the month.[585]\nThe Italian national patronal day, on 4 October, celebrates Saints Francis and Catherine. Each city or town also celebrates a public holiday on the occasion of the festival of the local patron saint,[582] for example: Rome on 29 June (Saints Peter and Paul), Milan on 7 December (Saint Ambrose), Naples on 19 September (Saint Januarius), Venice on 25 April (Saint Mark the Evangelist) and Florence on 24 June (Saint John the Baptist).\nThere are many festivals and festivities in Italy. Some of them include the Palio di Siena horse race, Holy Week rites, Saracen Joust of Arezzo, Saint Ubaldo Day in Gubbio, Giostra della Quintana in Foligno, and the Calcio Fiorentino. In 2013, UNESCO has included among the intangible cultural heritage some Italian festivals and pasos (in Italian \"macchine a spalla\"), such as the Varia di Palmi, the Macchina di Santa Rosa in Viterbo, the Festa dei Gigli in Nola, and faradda di li candareri in Sassari.[587]\nOther festivals include the carnivals in Venice, Viareggio, Satriano di Lucania, Mamoiada, and Ivrea, mostly known for its Battle of the Oranges. The Venice International Film Festival, awarding the \"Golden Lion\" and held annually since 1932, is the oldest film festival in the world and one of the \"Big Three\" alongside Cannes and Berlin.[586][588]", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", " https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/germany#bodyContent", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page",

italiano:\u00a0Italia,\u00a0[i\u02c8ta\u02d0lja]\u00a0(AFI),\u00a0 escoitar[3]), oficialmente Rep\u00fablica Italiana[4] ( pronunciaci\u00f3n (axuda\u00a0\u00b7 info)) (en italiano: Repubblica Italiana), \u00e9 unha rep\u00fablica parlamentaria cuxo territorio est\u00e1 en Europa meridional (99,97%) e no norte de \u00c1frica (0,03%). O territorio europeo conf\u00f3rmano a maior parte da pen\u00ednsula It\u00e1lica, o val do r\u00edo Po e d\u00faas grandes illas no mar Mediterr\u00e1neo: Sicilia e Sarde\u00f1a. O territorio africano f\u00f3rmano as pequenas illas de Lampedusa, Lampione e Pantelaria.\nNo norte est\u00e1 flanqueado polo arco alpino onde limita, de leste a oeste, con Eslovenia, Austria, Su\u00edza e Francia. O resto do territorio est\u00e1 circundado polos mares L\u00edgur, Tirreno, X\u00f3nico e Adri\u00e1tico. Os pequenos estados da Cidade do Vaticano e San Marino son enclaves dentro do territorio italiano. \u00c1 s\u00faa vez Campione d'Italia \u00e9 un concello italiano que forma un pequeno enclave en territorio su\u00edzo. A superficie total \u00e9 de 301.340\u00a0km2, cunha poboaci\u00f3n de 60,8 mill\u00f3ns de habitantes[1][5]. A s\u00faa capital desde os tempos do Imperio romano \u00e9 Roma, e foi durante s\u00e9culos o centro pol\u00edtico e cultural da civilizaci\u00f3n occidental.\nTen sido o fogar de moitas culturas europeas coma a civilizaci\u00f3n de Nuraga, os etruscos, os gregos e os romanos. Despois da ca\u00edda do Imperio Romano de Occidente, a Italia medieval foi invadida e sometida \u00e1 dominaci\u00f3n de pobos xerm\u00e1nicos coma os ostrogodos, os longobardos e os normandos. Isto non impediu que a Pen\u00ednsula, coa revitalizaci\u00f3n comercial das comunas medievais, chegara a se-lo berce do capitalismo[6][7]. No s\u00e9culo XV, coa difusi\u00f3n do Renacemento por toda Europa, conv\u00e9rtese no centro cultural do mundo occidental; mais despois das guerras do s\u00e9culo XVI cae baixo a soberan\u00eda de potencias estranxeiras, coma Francia, Espa\u00f1a e Austria. Durante o Risorgimento combate pola independencia e pola unidade, ata que en 1861 foi proclamado o Reino de Italia. A ditadura fascista, iniciada en 1922, rematou coa derrota na segunda guerra mundial e a guerra de liberaci\u00f3n. En 1946, logo dun referendo institucional, o Estado italiano conv\u00e9rtese nunha rep\u00fablica parlamentaria regulada pola Constituci\u00f3n de 1948.\nNo 2014 Italia, oitava potencia econ\u00f3mica mundial e cuarta europea, \u00e9 un pa\u00eds cun elevado nivel de vida: o \u00edndice de desenvolvemento humano \u00e9 moi alto, 0,872, e a esperanza de vida \u00e9 de 82,4 anos[8]. \u00c9 membro fundador da Uni\u00f3n Europea, da OTAN, do Consello de Europa e da OCDE; adherido \u00e1 ONU e \u00f3 tratado de Schengen. \u00c9 ademais membro do G7, do G8 e do G20; participa no proxecto Nuclear Sharing da OTAN, \u00e9 unha gran potencia rexional europea[9], capaz de exercer influencia pol\u00edtica sobre opci\u00f3ns e decisi\u00f3ns de orde extraeuropeo e internacional[10][11][12][13][14], e est\u00e1 en novena posici\u00f3n do mundo por gasto militar. En Roma te\u00f1en a s\u00faa sede numerosas organizaci\u00f3ns internacionais coma a Organizaci\u00f3n para a Agricultura e a Alimentaci\u00f3n, o Fondo Internacional de Desenvolvemento Agr\u00edcola, o Glocal Forum ou o Programa Mundial de Alimentos.\nItalia pos\u00fae o maior n\u00famero de sitios declarados patrimonio da Humanidade pola UNESCO[15]. \u00c9 o quinto pa\u00eds do mundo e terceiro da Uni\u00f3n Europea que m\u00e1is turistas recibe por ano, sendo Roma a terceira cidade m\u00e1is visitada[16]. Outras cidades importantes son Mil\u00e1n, centro industrial e finaceiro, e, segundo o \"Global Language Monitor\", a capital da Moda[17]; Tur\u00edn, centro da industria automobil\u00edstica e do dese\u00f1o industrial, Bolo\u00f1a, coa universidade m\u00e1is antiga do mundo; as cidades hist\u00f3ricas de Venecia, Florencia e N\u00e1poles etc.\nO nome Italia v\u00e9n da Roma antiga. Os romanos chamaban ao sur da pen\u00ednsula italiana de Italia, que significa \"terra de bois\" ou \"terra de pastos\".\nItalia influenciou bastante o desenvolvemento cultural e social de toda a Europa mediterr\u00e1nea, e sobre toda a cultura europea. Importantes culturas e civilizaci\u00f3ns existiron desde tempos prehist\u00f3ricos, tales como a civilizaci\u00f3n etrusca, que dominaron esta parte do mundo durante s\u00e9culos, e especialmente o Imperio Romano, que estendeu os seus l\u00edmites sobre a maior parte do continente europeo, o norte da \u00c1frica e o Oriente Medio.\nDespois da ca\u00edda do Imperio Romano de Occidente en 476, a provincia italiana foi gobernada por unha serie de reis b\u00e1rbaros, ata o s\u00e9culo VI, cando os Estados Papais foron creados, coa capital en Roma, baixo o comando da Igrexa cat\u00f3lica En 776, a Lombard\u00eda foi conquistada por Carlomagno, que foi coroado emperador da Lombard\u00eda e do Sacro Imperio Romano Xerm\u00e1nico en 800, polo papa Le\u00f3n III.\nA partir do s\u00e9culo X, as cidades do norte da actual Italia pasaron a ficar m\u00e1is independentes entre si, torn\u00e1ndose centros econ\u00f3micos e pol\u00edticos importantes. Elas tornar\u00edanse cidades-estado, ao longo da Idade Media e do Renacemento, e exercer\u00edan grande influencia sobre o panorama cultural e econ\u00f3mico do continente europeo. San Marino \u00e9 un vestixio desas cidades-estado.\nA Italia tornouse unha naci\u00f3n unida o 17 de marzo de 1861, cando a maior parte das cidades-estado foron unidas sobre o comando do Rei V\u00edtor Manuel II, do Piemonte. Os arquitectos da Unificaci\u00f3n italiana foron o Conde de Cavour, o ministro-xefe de Vitor Manuel, e Giuseppe Garibaldi, un xeneral e heroe italiano. Roma ficar\u00eda baixo o control do Papado por m\u00e1is unha d\u00e9cada ata o 20 de setembro de 1870. O Vaticano \u00e9 un pa\u00eds independente, un enclave totalmente cercado pola cidade de Roma, e un vestixio dos antigos Estados Papais.\nDesde finais do s\u00e9culo XIX, Italia converteuse nunha forza colonial, con colonias en Somalia, Eritrea, Libia e o Dodecaneso.\nO goberno ditatorial de Benito Mussolini, en 1922, culminou cunha alianza coa Alema\u00f1a e mailo Xap\u00f3n, e a consecuente formaci\u00f3n do Eixo, que levar\u00eda \u00e1 derrota italiana na segunda guerra mundial. O 2 de xu\u00f1o de 1946, un referendo resultou na abolici\u00f3n da monarqu\u00eda, e a instalaci\u00f3n dunha rep\u00fablica, que culminou coa adopci\u00f3n dunha nova constituci\u00f3n en 1 de xaneiro de 1948.\nA Italia foi un membro fundador da OTAN, fundada en 4 de abril de 1949, e da Uni\u00f3n Europea, creada entre 1952 e 1958. En 14 de decembro de 1955, Italia tornouse un membro da Organizaci\u00f3n das Naci\u00f3ns Unidas. O pa\u00eds, desde ent\u00f3n, xuntouse \u00e1 crecente unificaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica e pol\u00edtica da Europa Occidental. Un exemplo disto foi a introduci\u00f3n do Euro como moeda oficial do pa\u00eds, en 1999, substitu\u00edndo a antiga Lira italiana.\nA Constituci\u00f3n italiana de 1948 estableceu un Parlamento bicameral, que consiste nunha C\u00e1mara dos Deputados (Camera dei Deputati) e dun Senado (Senato della Repubblica) ben como un sistema xudiciario; e un sistema executivo composto dun Consello de Ministros (Consiglio dei ministri), liderado polo primeiro-ministro (Presidente del consiglio dei ministri). O presidente da rep\u00fablica (Presidente della Repubblica) \u00e9 elixido para mandatos de 7 anos de duraci\u00f3n polo Parlamento, xuntamente cun certo n\u00famero de delegados rexionais. O presidente escolle o primeiro ministro, e este prop\u00f3n os outros ministros, que son aprobados polo presidente. O Consello de Ministros precisan ter apoio (Fiducia - confianza) de ambas as casas do parlamento.\nOs deputados son elixidos directamente pola poboaci\u00f3n. De acordo coa lexislaci\u00f3n italiana de 1993, Italia ten membros \u00fanicos de cada distrito do pa\u00eds, para 75% dos postos no parlamento. Os outros 25% dos postos parlamentares son distribu\u00eddos regularmente. A C\u00e1mara dos Deputados pos\u00fae oficialmente 630 membros (mais, de feito, son apenas 619 despois das elecci\u00f3ns italianas de 2001). O Senado \u00e9 composto por 315 senadores, electos polo voto popular, ben como expresidentes e outras persoas (non m\u00e1is que cinco), indicadas polo presidente da rep\u00fablica, de acordo con provisi\u00f3ns constitucionais especiais. Ambas as C\u00e1maras de deputados e o Senado son electos para un mandato de no m\u00e1ximo cinco anos de duraci\u00f3n, mais poden ser disolvidas antes ao termo do mandato. As leis poden ser creadas na C\u00e1mara de deputados ou no Senado, e para seren aprobadas, precisan da maior\u00eda en ambas as C\u00e1maras.\nO sistema xudicial italiano est\u00e1 baseado nas leis romanas, modificadas polo C\u00f3digo Napole\u00f3nico e outros estatutos engadidos posteriormente. Hai tam\u00e9n unha corte constitucional (Corte Costituzionale), unha innovaci\u00f3n despois da segunda guerra mundial.\nEn materia de dereitos humanos, respecto \u00e1 pertenza nos sete organismos da Carta Internacional de Dereitos Humanos, que incl\u00faen o Comit\u00e9 de Dereitos Humanos (HRC), Italia firmou ou ratificou:\nItalia est\u00e1 dividida en rexi\u00f3ns, provincias e cidades. As rexi\u00f3ns son as maiores divisi\u00f3ns, cada rexi\u00f3n pos\u00fae unha capital rexional. Por exemplo: Toscana \u00e9 unha rexi\u00f3n e a s\u00faa capital \u00e9 Florencia. Cada rexi\u00f3n est\u00e1 dividida tam\u00e9n en pequenas provincias, cada unha delas tam\u00e9n cunha capital.\nRexi\u00f3ns de Italia:\nItalia est\u00e1 dividida en 20 rexi\u00f3ns. Segue abaixo (do norte \u00f3 sur) as rexi\u00f3ns e as s\u00faas respectivas capitais:\nA maior parte de Italia est\u00e1 localizada na Pen\u00ednsula It\u00e1lica, no continente europeo, e onde dous enclaves independentes est\u00e1n localizados: a Rep\u00fablica de San Marino e mailo Vaticano. As illas de Sicilia e Sarde\u00f1a tam\u00e9n fan parte de Italia.\nItalia limita ao norte con Su\u00edza e con Austria, \u00f3 leste coa Eslovenia, co Mar Adri\u00e1tico (a trav\u00e9s do cal contacta tam\u00e9n coa Croacia, Serbia e Montenegro (antiga Iugoslavia), Albania, e co Mar X\u00f3nico, que a separa da Grecia. Italia limita a sur co Mar Mediterr\u00e1neo (inclu\u00edndo a Canle de Malta que separa a Sicilia de Malta), co Mar Tirreno e co Mar da Liguria (ambos separando o territorio peninsular das illas de Sicilia e Sarde\u00f1a e da illa francesa da C\u00f3rsega). Finalmente, Italia limita ao oeste coa Francia.\nO terreo italiano \u00e9 bastante accidentado, cos Apeninos formando o esqueleto central da pen\u00ednsula. O punto m\u00e1is alto de Italia \u00e9 o Mont Blanc, cos seus 4,810 metros, mais dous volc\u00e1ns est\u00e1n m\u00e1is asociados co pa\u00eds: o Monte Etna, en Sicilia, e o Monte Vesuvio, preto de N\u00e1poles.\nItalia ten unha econom\u00eda industrial diversificada cunha renda total e per-capita m\u00e1is ou menos igual ao da Francia ou do Reino Unido. Esta econom\u00eda capitalista permanece dividida entre un norte industrialmente desenvolvido, dominado por empresas privadas, e un sur agr\u00edcola e menos desenvolvido, cunha taxa de desemprego do 20%. Por comparaci\u00f3n cos veci\u00f1os da Europa Occidental, ten un gran n\u00famero de Pequenas e Medias Empresas PMEs. A maior parte das materias primas necesarias \u00e1 industria e m\u00e1is do 75% da enerx\u00eda son importadas.\nDurante a \u00faltima d\u00e9cada, Italia seguiu unha pol\u00edtica fiscal apertada a fin de cumprir os criterios da Uni\u00f3n Econ\u00f3mica e Monetaria e beneficiouse de taxas de xuros e de inflaci\u00f3n m\u00e1is baixas, levando \u00e1 adhesi\u00f3n ao Euro desde o inicio, en 1999.\nO desenvolvemento econ\u00f3mico de Italia ten vindo a atrasarse en relaci\u00f3n aos seus socios da UE, e o actual goberno puxo en pr\u00e1ctica numerosas reformas de curto prazo destinadas a aumentar a competitividade e o crecemento a longo prazo da econom\u00eda. A pesar diso, ten andado devagar na implementaci\u00f3n de reformas estruturais consideradas necesarias polos economistas neoliberais, como a diminuci\u00f3n dos impostos, a flexibilizaci\u00f3n das leis que rexen o mercado de traballo e a reforma do sistema de pensi\u00f3ns por causa do abrandamento econ\u00f3mico en curso e da oposici\u00f3n dos sindicatos.\nItalia \u00e9 un pa\u00eds altamente urbanizado. As maiores cidades do pa\u00eds son Roma, Mil\u00e1n e N\u00e1poles, cada unha con m\u00e1is dun mill\u00f3n de habitantes. A densidade de poboaci\u00f3n italiana \u00e9 unha das m\u00e1is altas de Europa, con 197 hab./km\u00b2.\nItalia pos\u00fae unha taxa moi baixa de crecemento poboacional anual, unha das m\u00e1is baixas do continente, unha consecuencia de menos fillos por familia. A rexi\u00f3n de Trentino-Tirol do Sur (norte)[23] pos\u00fae a maior taxa de fertilidade, por outro lado as rexi\u00f3ns do Sul ten unha taxa de fertilidade inferior que as rexi\u00f3ns do norte.[24]\nCerca de 98\u00a0% da poboaci\u00f3n italiana son descendentes de italianos. Minor\u00edas incl\u00faen alem\u00e1ns que viven na rexi\u00f3n de Trentino-Tirol do Sur, e eslovenos, que viven na rexi\u00f3n de Trieste, ben como descendentes de franceses, que viven na rexi\u00f3n de Val de Aosta.\nItalia ten unha gran tradici\u00f3n deportiva. En diversos deportes, tanto individuais e en equipo, Italia ten unha boa representaci\u00f3n e moitos \u00e9xitos. O deporte m\u00e1is popular \u00e9 o f\u00fatbol. Baloncesto e voleibol son tam\u00e9n moito populares, cunha rica tradici\u00f3n en ambos. Italia ga\u00f1ou o Mundial de F\u00fatbol Alema\u00f1a 2006, e actualmente \u00e9 a segunda selecci\u00f3n de f\u00fatbol de maior \u00e9xito do mundo, despois do Brasil, vencendo catro Copas do Mundo. Italia tam\u00e9n ten forte tradici\u00f3n no ciclismo, tenis, atletismo, esgrima, deportes de inverno e rugby.\nO italiano \u00e9 unha lingua pertencente ao grupo das linguas romances orientais, da familia das linguas indoeuropeas. En Italia existe un gran n\u00famero de dialectos, cada un dos cales, desde o punto de vista hist\u00f3rico, \u00e9 mesmo unha lingua romance, representando unha evoluci\u00f3n aut\u00f3noma da variedade de lat\u00edn falada en cada rexi\u00f3n. A multitude de dialectos italianos constit\u00fae un grande, a\u00ednda que \u00e1s veces desco\u00f1ecido e denigrado, patrimonio cultural.\nO italiano moderno \u00e9 un dialecto que conseguiu facer carreira, imp\u00f3ndose como lingua oficial dunha \u00e1rea moito m\u00e1is ampla que a orixinaria. Neste caso foi o dialecto florentino, falado en Florencia, o que prevaleceu, non tanto por raz\u00f3ns pol\u00edticas, como por prestixio cultural. O toscano, e o florentino ilustre en particular (enriquecido con pr\u00e9stamos do siciliano, do franc\u00e9s e do lat\u00edn), foi a lingua na que escribiron Dante Alighieri, Francesco Petrarca e Giovanni Boccaccio, considerados tres dos mellores escritores italianos. Naturalmente, era tam\u00e9n a lingua culta da cidade de Florencia, admirada pola s\u00faa prosperidade cultural ao longo dos s\u00e9culos e pola s\u00faa espl\u00e9ndida arquitectura.\nSon cooficiais co italiano, que \u00e9 a lingua oficial do Estado, o alem\u00e1n e o ladino na provincia Aut\u00f3noma de Bolzano e o franc\u00e9s na rexi\u00f3n do Val de Aosta. Tam\u00e9n son reco\u00f1ecidas e protexidas polo Estado e as relativas rexi\u00f3ns as minor\u00edas ling\u00fc\u00edsticas, entre as que cabe destacar o esloveno, o sardo, o friulano e o francoprovenzal. Na illa de Sarde\u00f1a tam\u00e9n se fala un dialecto do catal\u00e1n na localidade de Alghero (en catal\u00e1n Alguer).\nA lingua de sinais italiana (en italiano Lingua dei Segni Italiana; LIS) \u00e9 a lingua visual dos italiano xordos, cunha poboaci\u00f3n de usuarios estimada entre 80 e 120.000 persoas. Italia non reco\u00f1ece a lingua de sinais como lingua nacional dos xordos, nin como lingua minoritaria: s\u00f3 na rexi\u00f3n do Val de Aosta foi aprobada por unanimidade o reco\u00f1ecemento da lingua de sinais en 2006.\nMoitas linguas rexionais de Italia, ve\u00f1en sendo consideradas erroneamente dialectos do italiano, sendo linguas por si propias. Particularmente nomearemos o piemont\u00e9s, o l\u00edgur ou xenov\u00e9s, o lombardo, o veneciano, o emiliano-roma\u00f1olo, o napolitano e o siciliano.", "links":

[Legend]\nBulgaria (/b\u028cl\u02c8\u0261\u025b\u0259ri\u0259, b\u028al-/ (listen); Bulgarian: \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f, romanized:\u00a0B\u01celgariya), officially the Republic of Bulgaria,[a] is a country in Southeast Europe. It is situated on the eastern flank of the Balkans, and is bordered by Romania to the north, Serbia and North Macedonia to the west, Greece and Turkey to the south, and the Black Sea to the east. Bulgaria covers a territory of 110,994 square kilometres (42,855\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), and is the sixteenth-largest country in Europe. Sofia is the nation's capital and largest city; other major cities are Plovdiv, Varna and Burgas.\nOne of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the Neolithic Karanovo culture, which dates back to 6,500 BC. In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for ancient Thracians, Persians, Celts and Macedonians; stability came when the Roman Empire conquered the region in AD 45. After the Roman state splintered, tribal invasions in the region resumed. Around the 6th century, these territories were settled by the early Slavs. The Bulgars, led by Asparuh, attacked from the lands of Old Great Bulgaria and permanently invaded the Balkans in the late 7th century. They established the First Bulgarian Empire, victoriously recognised by treaty in 681 AD by the Eastern Roman Empire. It dominated most of the Balkans and significantly influenced Slavic cultures by developing the Cyrillic script. The First Bulgarian Empire lasted until the early 11th century, when Byzantine emperor Basil II conquered and dismantled it. A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a Second Bulgarian Empire, which reached its apex under Ivan Asen II (1218\u20131241). After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife, the empire disintegrated and in 1396 fell under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries.\nThe Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u201378 resulted in the formation of the third and current Bulgarian state. Many ethnic Bulgarians were left outside the new nation's borders, which stoked irredentist sentiments that led to several conflicts with its neighbours and alliances with Germany in both world wars. In 1946, Bulgaria came under the Soviet-led Eastern Bloc and became a socialist state. The ruling Communist Party gave up its monopoly on power after the revolutions of 1989 and allowed multiparty elections. Bulgaria then transitioned into a democracy and a market-based economy. Since adopting a democratic constitution in 1991, Bulgaria has been a unitary parliamentary republic composed of 28 provinces, with a high degree of political, administrative, and economic centralisation.\nBulgaria is a developing country, with an upper-middle-income economy, ranking 68th in the Human Development Index. Its market economy is part of the European Single Market and is largely based on services, followed by industry\u2014especially machine building and mining\u2014and agriculture. Widespread corruption is a major socioeconomic issue; Bulgaria ranked as the most corrupt country in the European Union between 2018 and 2021, until being overtaken by Hungary in 2022.[8] The country also faces a demographic crisis, with its population slowly shrinking, down from a peak of 9,009,018 in 1989, to roughly 6.4 million today. Bulgaria is a member of the European Union, NATO, and the Council of Europe; it is also a founding member of the OSCE, and has taken a seat on the United Nations Security Council three times.\nThe name Bulgaria is derived from the Bulgars, a tribe of Turkic origin that founded the First Bulgarian Empire. Their name is not completely understood and is difficult to trace back earlier than the 4th century AD,[9] but it is possibly derived from the Proto-Turkic word bul\u0123ha (\"to mix\", \"shake\", \"stir\") and its derivative bulgak (\"revolt\", \"disorder\").[10] The meaning may be further extended to \"rebel\", \"incite\" or \"produce a state of disorder\", and so, in the derivative, the \"disturbers\".[11][12][13] Tribal groups in Inner Asia with phonologically close names were frequently described in similar terms, as the Buluoji, a component of the \"Five Barbarian\" groups, which during the 4th century were portrayed as both: a \"mixed race\" and \"troublemakers\".[14]\nNeanderthal remains dating to around 150,000 years ago, or the Middle Paleolithic, are some of the earliest traces of human activity in the lands of modern Bulgaria.[15] Remains from Homo sapiens found there are dated c. 47,000\u2009years\u2009BP. This result represents the earliest arrival of modern humans in Europe.[16][17] The Karanovo culture arose circa 6,500 BC and was one of several Neolithic societies in the region that thrived on agriculture.[18] The Copper Age Varna culture (fifth millennium BC) is credited with inventing gold metallurgy.[19][20] The associated Varna Necropolis treasure contains the oldest golden jewellery in the world with an approximate age of over 6,000 years.[21][22] The treasure has been valuable for understanding social hierarchy and stratification in the earliest European societies.[23][24][25]\nThe Thracians, one of the three primary ancestral groups of modern Bulgarians, appeared on the Balkan Peninsula some time before the 12th century BC.[26][27][28] The Thracians excelled in metallurgy and gave the Greeks the Orphean and Dionysian cults, but remained tribal and stateless.[29] The Persian Achaemenid Empire conquered parts of present-day Bulgaria (in particular eastern Bulgaria) in the 6th century BC and retained control over the region until 479 BC.[30][31] The invasion became a catalyst for Thracian unity, and the bulk of their tribes united under king Teres to form the Odrysian kingdom in the 470s BC.[29][31][32] It was weakened and vassalised by Philip II of Macedon in 341 BC,[33] attacked by Celts in the 3rd century,[34] and finally became a province of the Roman Empire in AD 45.[35]\nBy the end of the 1st century AD, Roman governance was established over the entire Balkan Peninsula and Christianity began spreading in the region around the 4th century.[29] The Gothic Bible\u2014the first Germanic language book\u2014was created by Gothic bishop Ulfilas in what is today northern Bulgaria around 381.[36] The region came under Byzantine control after the fall of Rome in 476. The Byzantines were engaged in prolonged warfare against Persia and could not defend their Balkan territories from barbarian incursions.[37] This enabled the Slavs to enter the Balkan Peninsula as marauders, primarily through an area between the Danube River and the Balkan Mountains known as Moesia.[38] Gradually, the interior of the peninsula became a country of the South Slavs, who lived under a democracy.[39][40] The Slavs assimilated the partially Hellenised, Romanised, and Gothicised Thracians in the rural areas.[41][42][43][44]\nNot long after the Slavic incursion, Moesia was once again invaded, this time by the Bulgars under Khan Asparukh.[45] Their horde was a remnant of Old Great Bulgaria, an extinct tribal confederacy situated north of the Black Sea in what is now Ukraine and southern Russia. Asparukh attacked Byzantine territories in Moesia and conquered the Slavic tribes there in 680.[27] A peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire was signed in 681, marking the foundation of the First Bulgarian Empire. The minority Bulgars formed a close-knit ruling caste.[46]\nSucceeding rulers strengthened the Bulgarian state throughout the 8th and 9th centuries. Krum introduced a written code of law[47] and checked a major Byzantine incursion at the Battle of Pliska, in which Byzantine emperor Nicephorus I was killed.[48] Boris I abolished paganism in favour of Eastern Orthodox Christianity in 864. The conversion was followed by a Byzantine recognition of the Bulgarian church[49] and the adoption of the Cyrillic alphabet, developed in the capital, Preslav.[50] The common language, religion and script strengthened central authority and gradually fused the Slavs and Bulgars into a unified people speaking a single Slavic language.[51][50] A golden age began during the 34-year rule of Simeon the Great, who oversaw the largest territorial expansion of the state.[52]\nAfter Simeon's death, Bulgaria was weakened by wars with Magyars and Pechenegs and the spread of the Bogomil heresy.[51][53] Preslav was seized by the Byzantine army in 971 after consecutive Rus' and Byzantine invasions.[51] The empire briefly recovered from the attacks under Samuil,[54] but this ended when Byzantine emperor Basil II defeated the Bulgarian army at Klyuch in 1014. Samuil died shortly after the battle,[55] and by 1018 the Byzantines had conquered the First Bulgarian Empire.[56] After the conquest, Basil II prevented revolts by retaining the rule of local nobility, integrating them in Byzantine bureaucracy and aristocracy, and relieving their lands of the obligation to pay taxes in gold, allowing tax in kind instead.[57][58] The Bulgarian Patriarchate was reduced to an archbishopric, but retained its autocephalous status and its dioceses.[58][57]\nByzantine domestic policies changed after Basil's death and a series of unsuccessful rebellions broke out, the largest being led by Peter Delyan. The empire's authority declined after a catastrophic military defeat at Manzikert against Seljuk invaders, and was further disturbed by the Crusades. This prevented Byzantine attempts at Hellenisation and created fertile ground for further revolt. In 1185, Asen dynasty nobles Ivan Asen I and Peter IV organised a major uprising and succeeded in re-establishing the Bulgarian state. Ivan Asen and Peter laid the foundations of the Second Bulgarian Empire with its capital at Tarnovo.[59]\nKaloyan, the third of the Asen monarchs, extended his dominion to Belgrade and Ohrid. He acknowledged the spiritual supremacy of the pope and received a royal crown from a papal legate.[60] The empire reached its zenith under Ivan Asen II (1218\u20131241), when its borders expanded as far as the coast of Albania, Serbia and Epirus, while commerce and culture flourished.[60][59] Ivan Asen's rule was also marked by a shift away from Rome in religious matters.[61]\nThe Asen dynasty became extinct in 1257. Internal conflicts and incessant Byzantine and Hungarian attacks followed, enabling the Mongols to establish suzerainty over the weakened Bulgarian state.[60][61] In 1277, swineherd Ivaylo led a great peasant revolt that expelled the Mongols from Bulgaria and briefly made him emperor.[62][59] He was overthrown in 1280 by the feudal landlords,[62] whose factional conflicts caused the Second Bulgarian Empire to disintegrate into small feudal dominions by the 14th century.[59] These fragmented rump states\u2014two tsardoms at Vidin and Tarnovo and the Despotate of Dobrudzha\u2014became easy prey for a new threat arriving from the Southeast: the Ottoman Turks.[60]\nThe Ottomans were employed as mercenaries by the Byzantines in the 1340s but later became invaders in their own right.[63] Sultan Murad I took Adrianople from the Byzantines in 1362; Sofia fell in 1382, followed by Shumen in 1388.[63] The Ottomans completed their conquest of Bulgarian lands in 1393 when Tarnovo was sacked after a three-month siege and the Battle of Nicopolis which brought about the fall of the Vidin Tsardom in 1396. Sozopol was the last Bulgarian settlement to fall, in 1453.[64] The Bulgarian nobility was subsequently eliminated and the peasantry was enserfed to Ottoman masters,[63] while much of the educated clergy fled to other countries.[65]\nBulgarians were subjected to heavy taxes (including Devshirme, or blood tax), their culture was suppressed,[65] and they experienced partial Islamisation.[66] Ottoman authorities established a religious administrative community called the Rum Millet, which governed all Orthodox Christians regardless of their ethnicity.[67] Most of the local population then gradually lost its distinct national consciousness, identifying only by its faith.[68][69] The clergy remaining in some isolated monasteries kept their ethnic identity alive, enabling its survival in remote rural areas,[70] and in the militant Catholic community in the northwest of the country.[71]\nAs Ottoman power began to wane, Habsburg Austria and Russia saw Bulgarian Christians as potential allies. The Austrians first backed an uprising in Tarnovo in 1598, then a second one in 1686, the Chiprovtsi Uprising in 1688 and finally Karposh's Rebellion in 1689.[72] The Russian Empire also asserted itself as a protector of Christians in Ottoman lands with the Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca in 1774.[72]\nThe Western European Enlightenment in the 18th century influenced the initiation of a national awakening of Bulgaria.[63] It restored national consciousness and provided an ideological basis for the liberation struggle, resulting in the 1876 April Uprising. Up to 30,000 Bulgarians were killed as Ottoman authorities put down the rebellion. The massacres prompted the Great Powers to take action.[73] They convened the Constantinople Conference in 1876, but their decisions were rejected by the Ottomans. This allowed the Russian Empire to seek a military solution without risking confrontation with other Great Powers, as had happened in the Crimean War.[73] In 1877, Russia declared war on the Ottomans and defeated them with the help of Bulgarian rebels, particularly during the crucial Battle of Shipka Pass which secured Russian control over the main road to Constantinople.[74][75]\nThe Treaty of San Stefano was signed on 3 March 1878 by Russia and the Ottoman Empire. It was to set up an autonomous Bulgarian principality spanning Moesia, Macedonia and Thrace, roughly on the territories of the Second Bulgarian Empire,[76][77] and this day is now a public holiday called National Liberation Day.[78] The other Great Powers immediately rejected the treaty out of fear that such a large country in the Balkans might threaten their interests. It was superseded by the Treaty of Berlin, signed on 13 July. It provided for a much smaller state, the Principality of Bulgaria, only comprising Moesia and the region of Sofia, and leaving large populations of ethnic Bulgarians outside the new country.[76][79] This significantly contributed to Bulgaria's militaristic foreign affairs approach during the first half of the 20th century.[80]\nThe Bulgarian principality won a war against Serbia and incorporated the semi-autonomous Ottoman territory of Eastern Rumelia in 1885, proclaiming itself an independent state on 5 October 1908.[81] In the years following independence, Bulgaria increasingly militarised and was often referred to as \"the Balkan Prussia\".[82] It became involved in three consecutive conflicts between 1912 and 1918\u2014two Balkan Wars and World War I. After a disastrous defeat in the Second Balkan War, Bulgaria again found itself fighting on the losing side as a result of its alliance with the Central Powers in World War I. Despite fielding more than a quarter of its population in a 1,200,000-strong army[83][84] and achieving several decisive victories at Doiran and Monastir, the country capitulated in 1918. The war resulted in significant territorial losses and a total of 87,500 soldiers killed.[85] More than 253,000 refugees from the lost territories immigrated to Bulgaria from 1912 to 1929,[86] placing additional strain on the already ruined national economy.[87]\nThe resulting political unrest led to the establishment of a royal authoritarian dictatorship by Tsar Boris III (1918\u20131943). Bulgaria entered World War II in 1941 as a member of the Axis but declined to participate in Operation Barbarossa and saved its Jewish population from deportation to concentration camps.[88] The sudden death of Boris III in mid-1943 pushed the country into political turmoil as the war turned against Germany, and the communist guerrilla movement gained momentum. The government of Bogdan Filov subsequently failed to achieve peace with the Allies. Bulgaria did not comply with Soviet demands to expel German forces from its territory, resulting in a declaration of war and an invasion by the USSR in September 1944.[89] The communist-dominated Fatherland Front took power, ended participation in the Axis and joined the Allied side until the war ended.[90] Bulgaria suffered little war damage and the Soviet Union demanded no reparations. But all wartime territorial gains, with the notable exception of Southern Dobrudzha, were lost.[91]\nThe left-wing coup d'\u00e9tat of 9 September 1944 led to the abolition of the monarchy and the executions of some 1,000\u20133,000 dissidents, war criminals, and members of the former royal elite.[92][93][94] But it was not until 1946 that a one-party people's republic was instituted following a referendum.[95] It fell into the Soviet sphere of influence under the leadership of Georgi Dimitrov (1946\u20131949), who established a repressive, rapidly industrialising Stalinist state.[91] By the mid-1950s, standards of living rose significantly and political repression eased.[96][97] The Soviet-style planned economy saw some experimental market-oriented policies emerging under Todor Zhivkov (1954\u20131989).[98] Compared to wartime levels, national GDP increased five-fold and per capita GDP quadrupled by the 1980s,[99] although severe debt spikes took place in 1960, 1977 and 1980.[100] Zhivkov's daughter Lyudmila bolstered national pride by promoting Bulgarian heritage, culture and arts worldwide.[101] Facing declining birth rates among the ethnic Bulgarian majority, Zhivkov's government in 1984 forced the minority ethnic Turks to adopt Slavic names in an attempt to erase their identity and assimilate them.[102] These policies resulted in the emigration of some 300,000 ethnic Turks to Turkey.[103][104]\nThe Communist Party was forced to give up its political monopoly on 10 November 1989 under the influence of the Revolutions of 1989. Zhivkov resigned and Bulgaria embarked on a transition to a parliamentary democracy.[105] The first free elections in June 1990 were won by the Communist Party, now rebranded as the Bulgarian Socialist Party.[106] A new constitution that provided for a relatively weak elected president and for a prime minister accountable to the legislature was adopted in July 1991.[107] The new system initially failed to improve living standards or create economic growth\u2014the average quality of life and economic performance remained lower than under communism well into the early 2000s.[108] After 2001, economic, political and geopolitical conditions improved greatly,[109] and Bulgaria achieved high Human Development status in 2003.[110] It became a member of NATO in 2004[111] and participated in the War in Afghanistan. After several years of reforms, it joined the European Union and the single market in 2007, despite EU concerns over government corruption.[112] Bulgaria hosted the 2018 Presidency of the Council of the European Union at the National Palace of Culture in Sofia.[113]\nBulgaria is a middle-sized country situated in Southeastern Europe, in the east of the Balkans. Its territory covers an area of 110,994 square kilometres (42,855\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), while land borders with its five neighbouring countries run a total length of 1,808 kilometres (1,123\u00a0mi), and its coastline is 354 kilometres (220\u00a0mi) long.[114] Bulgaria's geographic coordinates are 43\u00b0 N 25\u00b0 E.[115] The most notable topographical features of the country are the Danubian Plain, the Balkan Mountains, the Thracian Plain, and the Rila-Rhodope massif.[114] The southern edge of the Danubian Plain slopes upward into the foothills of the Balkans, while the Danube defines the border with Romania. The Thracian Plain is roughly triangular, beginning southeast of Sofia and broadening as it reaches the Black Sea coast.[114]\nThe Balkan mountains run laterally through the middle of the country from west to east. The mountainous southwest has two distinct alpine type ranges\u2014Rila and Pirin, which border the lower but more extensive Rhodope Mountains to the east, and various medium altitude mountains to west, northwest and south, like Vitosha, Osogovo and Belasitsa.[114] Musala, at 2,925 metres (9,596\u00a0ft), is the highest point in both Bulgaria and the Balkans. The Black Sea coast is the country's lowest point.[115] Plains occupy about one third of the territory, while plateaux and hills occupy 41%.[116] Most rivers are short and with low water levels. The longest river located solely in Bulgarian territory, the Iskar, has a length of 368 kilometres (229\u00a0mi). The Struma and the Maritsa are two major rivers in the south.[117][114]\nBulgaria has a varied and changeable climate, which results from being positioned at the meeting point of the Mediterranean, Oceanic and Continental air masses combined with the barrier effect of its mountains.[114] Northern Bulgaria averages 1\u00a0\u00b0C (1.8\u00a0\u00b0F) cooler, and registers 200 millimetres (7.9\u00a0in) more precipitation, than the regions south of the Balkan mountains. Temperature amplitudes vary significantly in different areas. The lowest recorded temperature is \u221238.3\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221236.9\u00a0\u00b0F), while the highest is 45.2\u00a0\u00b0C (113.4\u00a0\u00b0F).[118] Precipitation averages about 630 millimetres (24.8\u00a0in) per year, and varies from 500 millimetres (19.7\u00a0in) in Dobrudja to more than 2,500 millimetres (98.4\u00a0in) in the mountains. Continental air masses bring significant amounts of snowfall during winter.[119]\nConsidering its relatively small area, Bulgaria has variable and complex climate. The country occupies the southernmost part of the continental climatic zone, with small areas in the south falling within the Mediterranean climatic zone.[120] The continental zone is predominant, because continental air masses flow easily into the unobstructed Danubian Plain. The continental influence, stronger during the winter, produces abundant snowfall; the Mediterranean influence increases during the second half of summer and produces hot and dry weather. Bulgaria is subdivided into five climatic zones: continental zone (Danubian Plain, Pre-Balkan and the higher valleys of the Transitional geomorphological region); transitional zone (Upper Thracian Plain, most of the Struma and Mesta valleys, the lower Sub-Balkan valleys); continental-Mediterranean zone (the southernmost areas of the Struma and Mesta valleys, the eastern Rhodope Mountains, Sakar and Strandzha); Black Sea zone along the coastline with an average length of 30\u201340\u00a0km inland; and alpine zone in the mountains above 1000\u00a0m altitude (central Balkan Mountains, Rila, Pirin, Vitosha, western Rhodope Mountains, etc.).[121]\nFebruary record high\u00a0: http://eea.government.bg/bg/soer/2016/climate/climate0\nNovember record high\u00a0: https://m.dir.bg/weather/novini/s-32-4-c-veliko-tarnovo-schupi-95-godishen-natsionalen-rekord\nThe interaction of climatic, hydrological, geological and topographical conditions has produced a relatively wide variety of plant and animal species.[122]\nBulgaria's biodiversity, one of the richest in Europe,[123] is conserved in three national parks, 11 nature parks, 10 biosphere reserves and 565 protected areas.[124][125][126] Ninety-three of the 233 mammal species of Europe are found in Bulgaria, along with 49% of butterfly and 30% of vascular plant species.[127] Overall, 41,493 plant and animal species are present.[127] Larger mammals with sizable populations include deer (106,323 individuals), wild boar (88,948), golden jackal (47,293) and red fox (32,326). Partridges number some 328,000 individuals, making them the most widespread gamebird.[128] A third of all nesting birds in Bulgaria can be found in Rila National Park, which also hosts Arctic and alpine species at high altitudes.[129] Flora includes more than 3,800 vascular plant species of which 170 are endemic and 150 are considered endangered.[122] A checklist of larger fungi in Bulgaria by the Institute of Botany identifies more than 1,500 species.[130] More than 35% of the land area is covered by forests.[131]\nIn 1998, the Bulgarian government adopted the National Biological Diversity Conservation Strategy, a comprehensive programme seeking the preservation of local ecosystems, protection of endangered species and conservation of genetic resources.[132] Bulgaria has some of the largest Natura 2000 areas in Europe covering 33.8% of its territory.[133] It also achieved its Kyoto Protocol objective of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 30% from 1990 to 2009.[134]\nBulgaria ranks 30th in the 2018 Environmental Performance Index, but scores low on air quality.[135] Particulate levels are the highest in Europe,[136] especially in urban areas affected by automobile traffic and coal-based power stations.[137][138] One of these, the lignite-fired Maritsa Iztok-2 station, is causing the highest damage to health and the environment in the European Union.[139] Pesticide use in agriculture and antiquated industrial sewage systems produce extensive soil and water pollution.[140] Water quality began to improve in 1998 and has maintained a trend of moderate improvement. Over 75% of surface rivers meet European standards for good quality.[141]\nBulgaria is a parliamentary democracy where the prime minister is the head of government and the most powerful executive position.[109] The political system has three branches\u2014legislative, executive and judicial, with universal suffrage for citizens at least 18 years old. The Constitution also provides possibilities of direct democracy, namely petitions and national referendums.[142] Elections are supervised by an independent Central Election Commission that includes members from all major political parties. Parties must register with the commission prior to participating in a national election.[143] Normally, the prime minister-elect is the leader of the party receiving the most votes in parliamentary elections, although this is not always the case.[109]\nUnlike the prime minister, presidential domestic power is more limited. The directly elected president serves as head of state and commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and has the authority to return a bill for further debate, although the parliament can override the presidential veto by a simple majority vote.[109] Political parties gather in the National Assembly, a body of 240 deputies elected to four-year terms by direct popular vote. The National Assembly has the power to enact laws, approve the budget, schedule presidential elections, select and dismiss the prime minister and other ministers, declare war, deploy troops abroad, and ratify international treaties and agreements.[144]\nOverall, Bulgaria displays a pattern of unstable governments.[145] Boyko Borisov, the leader of the centre-right, pro-EU party GERB, served three terms as prime minister between 2009 and 2021.\nIt won the 2009 general election and formed a minority government,[146] which resigned in February 2013 after nationwide protests over the low living standards, corruption[147] and the perceived failure of the democratic system.[148]\nThe subsequent snap elections in May resulted in a narrow win for GERB,[149] but the Bulgarian Socialist Party eventually formed a government led by Plamen Oresharski after Borisov failed to secure parliamentary support.[150][151] The Oresharski government resigned in July 2014 amid continuing large-scale protests.[152][153]\nThe October 2014 elections resulted in a third GERB victory.[154] Borisov formed a coalition[155] with several right-wing parties, but resigned again after the candidate backed by his party failed to win the 2016 Presidential election. The March 2017 snap election was again won by GERB, but with 95 seats in Parliament. They formed a coalition with the far-right United Patriots, who held 27 seats.[156]\nBorisov's last cabinet saw a dramatic decrease in freedom of the press, and a number of corruption revelations that triggered yet another wave of mass protests in 2020.[157][158] GERB came out first in the regular April 2021 election, but with its weakest result so far.[159] All other parties refused to form a government,[160] and after a brief deadlock, another election was called for July 2021. It too failed to break the stalemate, as no political party was able to form a coalition government.[161]\nFreedom House has reported a continuing deterioration of democratic governance after 2009, citing reduced media independence, stalled reforms, abuse of authority at the highest level and increased dependence of local administrations on the central government.[162] Bulgaria is still listed as \"Free\", with a political system designated as a semi-consolidated democracy, albeit with deteriorating scores.[162] The Democracy Index defines it as a \"Flawed democracy\".[163] A 2018 survey by the Institute for Economics and Peace reported that less than 15% of respondents considered elections to be fair.[164]\nBulgaria has a civil law legal system.[165] The judiciary is overseen by the Ministry of Justice. The Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court of Cassation are the highest courts of appeal and oversee the application of laws in subordinate courts.[143] The Supreme Judicial Council manages the system and appoints judges. The legal system is regarded by both domestic and international observers as one of Europe's most inefficient due to pervasive lack of transparency and corruption.[166][167][168][169][170][excessive citations] Law enforcement is carried out by organisations mainly subordinate to the Ministry of the Interior.[171] The General Directorate of National Police (GDNP) combats general crime and maintains public order.[172] GDNP fields 26,578 police officers in its local and national sections.[173] The bulk of criminal cases are transport-related, followed by theft and drug-related crime; homicide rates are low.[174] The Ministry of the Interior also heads the Border Police Service and the National Gendarmerie\u2014a specialised branch for anti-terrorist activity, crisis management and riot control. Counterintelligence and national security are the responsibility of the State Agency for National Security.[175]\nBulgaria is a unitary state.[176] Since the 1880s, the number of territorial management units has varied from seven to 26.[177] Between 1987 and 1999, the administrative structure consisted of nine provinces (oblasti, singular oblast). A new administrative structure was adopted in parallel with the decentralisation of the economic system.[178] It includes 27 provinces and a metropolitan capital province (Sofia-Grad). All areas take their names from their respective capital cities. The provinces are subdivided into 265 municipalities. Municipalities are run by mayors, who are elected to four-year terms, and by directly elected municipal councils. Bulgaria is a highly centralised state where the Council of Ministers directly appoints regional governors and all provinces and municipalities are heavily dependent on it for funding.[143]\nBulgaria became a member of the United Nations in 1955 and since 1966 has been a non-permanent member of the Security Council three times, most recently from 2002 to 2003.[179] It was also among the founding nations of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) in 1975. Euro-Atlantic integration has been a priority since the fall of communism, although the communist leadership also had aspirations of leaving the Warsaw Pact and joining the European Communities by 1987.[180][181] Bulgaria signed the European Union Treaty of Accession on 25 April 2005,[182] and became a full member of the European Union on 1 January 2007.[112] In addition, it has a tripartite economic and diplomatic collaboration with Romania and Greece,[183] good ties with China[184] and Vietnam[185] and a historical relationship with Russia.[186]\nBulgaria deployed significant numbers of both civilian and military advisors in Soviet-allied countries like Nicaragua[187] and Libya during the Cold War.[188] The first deployment of foreign troops on Bulgarian soil since World War II occurred in 2001, when the country hosted six KC-135 Stratotanker aircraft and 200 support personnel for the war effort in Afghanistan.[24] International military relations were further expanded with accession to NATO in March 2004[111] and the US-Bulgarian Defence Cooperation Agreement signed in April 2006. Bezmer and Graf Ignatievo air bases, the Novo Selo training range, and a logistics centre in Aytos subsequently became joint military training facilities cooperatively used by the United States and Bulgarian militaries.[189][190] Despite its active international defence collaborations, Bulgaria ranks as among the most peaceful countries globally, tying 6th alongside Iceland regarding domestic and international conflicts, and 26th on average in the Global Peace Index.[164]\nThe Bulgarian Armed Forces are the military of Bulgaria and they are composed of land forces, navy and an air force. The Armed Forces have 36,950 active troops, supplemented by 3,000 reservists.[191] The land forces consist of two mechanised brigades and eight independent regiments and battalions; the air force operates 106 aircraft and air defence systems across six air bases, and the navy operates various ships, helicopters and coastal defence weapons.[192] Military inventory mainly consists of Soviet equipment like Mikoyan MiG-29 and Sukhoi Su-25 jets,[193] S-300PT air defence systems[194] and SS-21 Scarab short-range ballistic missiles.[195]\nBulgaria has an open, upper middle income range market economy where the private sector accounts for more than 70% of GDP.[196][197] From a largely agricultural country with a predominantly rural population in 1948, by the 1980s Bulgaria had transformed into an industrial economy, with scientific and technological research at the top of its budgetary expenditure priorities.[198] The loss of COMECON markets in 1990 and the subsequent \"shock therapy\" of the planned system caused a steep decline in industrial and agricultural production, ultimately followed by an economic collapse in 1997.[199][200] The economy largely recovered during a period of rapid growth several years later,[199] but the average salary of 1,036 leva ($615) per month remains the lowest in the EU.[201] More than a fifth of the labour force work for a minimum wage of $1.16 per hour.[202]\nA balanced budget was achieved in 2003 and the country began running a surplus the following year.[203] Expenditures amounted to $21.15 billion and revenues were $21.67 billion in 2017.[204] Most government spending on institutions is earmarked for security. The ministries of defence, the interior and justice are allocated the largest share of the annual government budget, whereas those responsible for the environment, tourism and energy receive the least funding.[205] Taxes form the bulk of government revenue[205] at 30% of GDP.[206] Bulgaria has some of the lowest corporate income tax rates in the EU at a flat 10% rate.[207] The tax system is two-tier. Value added tax, excise duties, corporate and personal income tax are national, whereas real estate, inheritance, and vehicle taxes are levied by local authorities.[208] Strong economic performance in the early 2000s reduced government debt from 79.6% in 1998 to 14.1% in 2008.[203] It has since increased to 28.7% of GDP by 2016, but remains the third lowest in the EU.[209]\nThe Yugozapaden planning area is the most developed region with a per capita gross domestic product (PPP) of $29,816 in 2018.[210] It includes the capital city and the surrounding Sofia Province, which alone generate 42% of national gross domestic product despite hosting only 22% of the population.[211][212] GDP per capita (in PPS) and the cost of living in 2019 stood at 53 and 52.8% of the EU average (100%), respectively.[213][214] National PPP GDP was estimated at $143.1\u00a0billion in 2016, with a per capita value of $20,116.[215] Economic growth statistics take into account illegal transactions from the informal economy, which is the largest in the EU as a percentage of economic output.[216][217] The Bulgarian National Bank issues the national currency, lev, which is pegged to the euro at a rate of 1.95583 lev\u0430 per euro.[218]\nAfter several consecutive years of high growth, repercussions of the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008 resulted in a 3.6% contraction of GDP in 2009 and increased unemployment.[219][220] Positive growth was restored in 2010 but intercompany debt exceeded $59 billion, meaning that 60% of all Bulgarian companies were mutually indebted.[221] By 2012, it had increased to $97 billion, or 227% of GDP.[222] The government implemented strict austerity measures with IMF and EU encouragement to some positive fiscal results, but the social consequences of these measures, such as increased income inequality and accelerated outward migration, have been \"catastrophic\" according to the International Trade Union Confederation.[223]\nSiphoning of public funds to the families and relatives of politicians from incumbent parties has resulted in fiscal and welfare losses to society.[224][225] Bulgaria ranks 71st in the Corruption Perceptions Index[226] and experiences the worst levels of corruption in the European Union, a phenomenon that remains a source of profound public discontent.[227][228] Along with organised crime, corruption has resulted in a rejection of the country's Schengen Area application and withdrawal of foreign investment.[229][230][231] Government officials reportedly engage in embezzlement, influence trading, government procurement violations and bribery with impunity.[166] Government procurement in particular is a critical area in corruption risk. An estimated 10 billion leva ($5.99 billion) of state budget and European cohesion funds are spent on public tenders each year;[232] nearly 14 billion ($8.38 billion) were spent on public contracts in 2017 alone.[233] A large share of these contracts are awarded to a few politically connected[234] companies amid widespread irregularities, procedure violations and tailor-made award criteria.[235] Despite repeated criticism from the European Commission,[231] EU institutions refrain from taking measures against Bulgaria because it supports Brussels on a number of issues, unlike Poland or Hungary.[227]\nThe labour force is 3.36\u00a0million people,[236] of whom 6.8% are employed in agriculture, 26.6% in industry and 66.6% in the services sector.[237] Extraction of metals and minerals, production of chemicals, machine building, steel, biotechnology, tobacco, food processing and petroleum refining are among the major industrial activities.[238][239][240] Mining alone employs 24,000 people and generates about 5% of the country's GDP; the number of employed in all mining-related industries is 120,000.[241][242] Bulgaria is Europe's fifth-largest coal producer.[242][243] Local deposits of coal, iron, copper and lead are vital for the manufacturing and energy sectors.[244] The main destinations of Bulgarian exports outside the EU are Turkey, China and the United States, while Russia and Turkey are by far the largest import partners. Most of the exports are manufactured goods, machinery, chemicals, fuel products and food.[245] Two-thirds of food and agricultural exports go to OECD countries.[246]\nAlthough cereal and vegetable output dropped by 40% between 1990 and 2008,[247] output in grains has since increased, and the 2016\u20132017 season registered the biggest grain output in a decade.[248][249] Maize, barley, oats and rice are also grown. Quality Oriental tobacco is a significant industrial crop.[250] Bulgaria is also the largest producer globally of lavender and rose oil, both widely used in fragrances.[24][251][252][253] Within the services sector, tourism is a significant contributor to economic growth. Sofia, Plovdiv, Veliko Tarnovo, coastal resorts Albena, Golden Sands and Sunny Beach and winter resorts Bansko, Pamporovo and Borovets are some of the locations most visited by tourists.[254][255] Most visitors are Romanian, Turkish, Greek and German.[256] Tourism is additionally encouraged through the 100 Tourist Sites system.[257]\nSpending on research and development amounts to 0.78% of GDP,[258] and the bulk of public R&D funding goes to the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (BAS).[259] Private businesses accounted for more than 73% of R&D expenditures and employed 42% of Bulgaria's 22,000 researchers in 2015.[260] The same year, Bulgaria ranked 39th out of 50 countries in the Bloomberg Innovation Index, the highest score being in education (24th) and the lowest in value-added manufacturing (48th).[261] Bulgaria was ranked 35th in the Global Innovation Index in 2021, up from 40th in 2019.[262][263][264][265] Chronic government underinvestment in research since 1990 has forced many professionals in science and engineering to leave Bulgaria.[266]\nDespite the lack of funding, research in chemistry, materials science and physics remains strong.[259] Antarctic research is actively carried out through the St. Kliment Ohridski Base on Livingston Island in Western Antarctica.[267][268] The information and communication technologies (ICT) sector generates three per cent of economic output and employs 40,000[269] to 51,000 software engineers.[270] Bulgaria was known as a \"Communist Silicon Valley\" during the Soviet era due to its key role in COMECON computing technology production.[271] A concerted effort by the communist government to teach computing and IT skills in schools also indirectly made Bulgaria a major source of computer viruses in the 1980s and 90s.[272] The country is a regional leader in high performance computing: it operates Avitohol, the most powerful supercomputer in Southeast Europe, and will host one of the eight petascale EuroHPC supercomputers.[273][274]\nBulgaria has made numerous contributions to space exploration.[275] These include two scientific satellites, more than 200 payloads and 300 experiments in Earth orbit, as well as two cosmonauts since 1971.[275] Bulgaria was the first country to grow wheat and vegetables in space with its Svet greenhouses on the Mir space station.[276][277] It was involved in the development of the Granat gamma-ray observatory[278] and the Vega program, particularly in modelling trajectories and guidance algorithms for both Vega probes.[279][280] Bulgarian instruments have been used in the exploration of Mars, including a spectrometer that took the first high quality spectroscopic images of Martian moon Phobos with the Phobos 2 probe.[275][278] Cosmic radiation en route to and around the planet has been mapped by Liulin-ML dosimeters on the ExoMars TGO.[281] Variants of these instruments have also been fitted on the International Space Station and the Chandrayaan-1 lunar probe.[282][283] Another lunar mission, SpaceIL's Beresheet, was also equipped with a Bulgarian-manufactured imaging payload.[284] Bulgaria's first geostationary communications satellite\u2014BulgariaSat-1\u2014was launched by SpaceX in 2017.[285]\nTelephone services are widely available, and a central digital trunk line connects most regions.[286] Vivacom (BTC) serves more than 90% of fixed lines and is one of the three operators providing mobile services, along with A1 and Telenor.[287][288] Internet penetration stood at 69.2% of the population aged 16\u201374 and 78.9% of households in 2020.[289][290]\nBulgaria's strategic geographic location and well-developed energy sector make it a key European energy centre despite its lack of significant fossil fuel deposits.[291] Thermal power plants generate 48.9% of electricity, followed by nuclear power from the Kozloduy reactors (34.8%) and renewable sources (16.3%).[292] Equipment for a second nuclear power station at Belene has been acquired, but the fate of the project remains uncertain.[293] Installed capacity amounts to 12,668 MW, allowing Bulgaria to exceed domestic demand and export energy.[294]\nThe national road network has a total length of 19,512 kilometres (12,124\u00a0mi),[295] of which 19,235 kilometres (11,952\u00a0mi) are paved. Railroads are a major mode of freight transportation, although highways carry a progressively larger share of freight. Bulgaria has 6,238 kilometres (3,876\u00a0mi) of railway track, [286] with rail links available to Romania, Turkey, Greece, and Serbia, and express trains serving direct routes to Kyiv, Minsk, Moscow and Saint Petersburg.[296] Sofia is the country's air travel hub, while Varna and Burgas are the principal maritime trade ports.[286]\nThe population of Bulgaria is 6,519,789 people according to the 2021 national census. The majority of the population, 72.5%, reside in urban areas.[297] As of 2019[update], Sofia is the most populated urban centre with 1,241,675 people, followed by Plovdiv (346,893), Varna (336,505), Burgas (202,434) and Ruse (142,902).[212] Bulgarians are the main ethnic group and constitute 84.8% of the population. Turkish and Roma minorities account for 8.8 and 4.9%, respectively; some 40 smaller minorities account for 0.7%, and 0.8% do not self-identify with an ethnic group.[298][299] Former Statistics head Reneta Indzhova has disputed the 2011 census figures, suggesting the actual population is smaller than reported.[300][301] The Roma minority is usually underestimated in census data and may represent up to 11% of the population.[302][303] Population density is 65 per square kilometre, almost half the European Union average.[304]\nIn 2018, the average total fertility rate (TFR) in Bulgaria was 1.56 children per woman,[305] below the replacement rate of 2.1 and considerably below the historical high of 5.83 children per woman in 1905.[306] Bulgaria thus has one of the oldest populations in the world, with an average age of 43 years.[307]\nBulgaria is in a state of demographic crisis.[308][309] It has had negative population growth since 1989, when the economic collapse caused a long-lasting emigration wave.[310] Some 937,000 to 1,200,000 people\u2014mostly young adults\u2014had left the country by 2005.[310][311] The majority of children are born to unmarried women.[312] Furthermore, a third of all households consist of only one person and 75.5% of families do not have children under the age of 16.[309] The resulting birth rates are among the lowest in the world[313][314] while death rates are among the highest.[315]\nBulgaria scores high in gender equality, ranking 18th in the 2018 Global Gender Gap Report.[316] Although women's suffrage was enabled relatively late, in 1937, women today have equal political rights, high workforce participation and legally mandated equal pay.[316] In 2021, market research agency Reboot Online ranked Bulgaria as the best European country for women to work.[317] Bulgaria has the highest ratio of female ICT researchers in the EU,[318] as well as the second-highest ratio of females in the technology sector at 44.6% of the workforce. High levels of female participation are a legacy of the Socialist era.[319]\nHigh death rates result from a combination of an ageing population, high numbers of people at risk of poverty, and a weak healthcare system.[321] Over 80% of deaths are due to cancer and cardiovascular conditions; nearly a fifth of those are avoidable.[322] Although healthcare in Bulgaria is nominally universal,[323] out-of-pocket expenses account for nearly half of all healthcare spending, significantly limiting access to medical care.[324] Other problems disrupting care provision are the emigration of doctors due to low wages, understaffed and under-equipped regional hospitals, supply shortages and frequent changes to the basic service package for those insured.[325][326] The 2018 Bloomberg Health Care Efficiency Index ranked Bulgaria last out of 56 countries.[327] Average life expectancy is 74.8 years, compared with an EU average of 80.99 and a world average of 72.38.[328][329]\nPublic expenditures for education are far below the European Union average as well.[330] Educational standards were once high,[331] but have declined significantly since the early 2000s.[330] Bulgarian students were among the highest-scoring in the world in terms of reading in 2001, performing better than their Canadian and German counterparts; by 2006, scores in reading, math and science had dropped. By 2018, Programme for International Student Assessment studies found 47% of pupils in the 9th grade to be functionally illiterate in reading and natural sciences.[332] Average basic literacy stands high at 98.4% with no significant difference between sexes.[333] The Ministry of Education and Science partially funds public schools, colleges and universities, sets criteria for textbooks and oversees the publishing process. Education in primary and secondary public schools is free and compulsory.[331] The process spans 12 grades, in which grades one through eight are primary and nine through twelve are secondary level. Higher education consists of a 4-year bachelor degree and a 1-year master's degree.[334] Bulgaria's highest-ranked higher education institution is Sofia University.[335][336]\nBulgarian is the only language with official status and native for 85% of the population.[337] It belongs to the Slavic group of languages but has a number of grammatical peculiarities, shared with its closest relative Macedonian, that set it apart from other Slavic languages: these include a complex verbal morphology (which also codes for distinctions in evidentiality), the absence of noun cases and infinitives, and the use of a suffixed definite article.[338] Other significant languages spoken in Bulgaria are Turkish and Romani, which according to the 2011 census were spoken natively by 9.1% and 4.2% of the population, respectively.\nBulgaria is a secular state with guaranteed religious freedom by constitution, but Orthodoxy is designated as a traditional religion.[339] More than three-quarters of Bulgarians subscribe to Eastern Orthodoxy.[340] The Bulgarian Orthodox Church gained autocephalous status in AD 927,[341][342] and has 12 dioceses and over 2,000 priests.[343]\nSunni Muslims are the second-largest religious community and constitute 10% of Bulgaria's overall religious makeup. A 2011 survey of 850 Muslims in Bulgaria found 30% self-professing as deeply religious and 50% as just religious. According to the study, some religious teachings, like Islamic funeral have been traditionally incorporated and are widely practiced while other major ones are less observed, like the Muslim prayer or abstaining from drinking alcohol, eating pork, and cohabitation.[344]\nLess than 3% of the population are affiliated with other religions and 11.8% are irreligious or do not self-identify with a religion.[340]\nContemporary Bulgarian culture blends the formal culture that helped forge a national consciousness towards the end of Ottoman rule with millennia-old folk traditions.[345] An essential element of Bulgarian folklore is fire, used to banish evil spirits and illnesses. Many of these are personified as witches, whereas other creatures like zmey and samodiva (veela) are either benevolent guardians or ambivalent tricksters.[346] Some rituals against evil spirits have survived and are still practised, most notably kukeri and survakari.[347] Martenitsa is also widely celebrated.[348] Nestinarstvo, a ritual fire-dance of Thracian origin, is included in the list of UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage.[349][350]\nNine historical and natural objects are UNESCO World Heritage Sites:  Pirin National Park, Sreburna Nature Reserve, the Madara Rider, the Thracian tombs in Sveshtari and Kazanlak, the Rila Monastery, the Boyana Church, the Rock-hewn Churches of Ivanovo and the ancient city of Nesebar.[351] The Rila Monastery was established by Saint John of Rila, Bulgaria's patron saint, whose life has been the subject of numerous literary accounts since Medieval times.[352]\nThe establishment of the Preslav and Ohrid literary schools in the 10th century is associated with a golden period in Bulgarian literature during the Middle Ages.[352] The schools' emphasis on Christian scriptures made the Bulgarian Empire a centre of Slavic culture, bringing Slavs under the influence of Christianity and providing them with a written language.[353][354][355] Its alphabet, Cyrillic script, was developed by the Preslav Literary School.[356] The Tarnovo Literary School, on the other hand, is associated with a Silver age of literature defined by high-quality manuscripts on historical or mystical themes under the Asen and Shishman dynasties.[352] Many literary and artistic masterpieces were destroyed by the Ottoman conquerors, and artistic activities did not re-emerge until the National Revival in the 19th century.[345] The enormous body of work of Ivan Vazov (1850\u20131921) covered every genre and touched upon every facet of Bulgarian society, bridging pre-Liberation works with literature of the newly established state.[352] Notable later works are Bay Ganyo by Aleko Konstantinov, the Nietzschean poetry of Pencho Slaveykov, the Symbolist poetry of Peyo Yavorov and Dimcho Debelyanov, the Marxist-inspired works of Geo Milev and Nikola Vaptsarov, and the Socialist realism novels of Dimitar Dimov and Dimitar Talev.[352] Tzvetan Todorov is a notable contemporary author,[357] while Bulgarian-born Elias Canetti was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1981.[358]\n\u0410 religious visual arts heritage includes frescoes, murals and icons, many produced by the medieval Tarnovo Artistic School.[359] Like literature, it was not until the National Revival when Bulgarian visual arts began to reemerge. Zahari Zograf was a pioneer of the visual arts in the pre-Liberation era.[345] After the Liberation, Ivan Mrkvi\u010dka, Anton Mitov, Vladimir Dimitrov, Tsanko Lavrenov and Zlatyu Boyadzhiev introduced newer styles and substance, depicting scenery from Bulgarian villages, old towns and historical subjects. Christo is the most famous Bulgarian artist of the 21st century, known for his outdoor installations.[345]\nFolk music is by far the most extensive traditional art and has slowly developed throughout the ages as a fusion of Far Eastern, Oriental, medieval Eastern Orthodox and standard Western European tonalities and modes.[360] Bulgarian folk music has a distinctive sound and uses a wide range of traditional instruments, such as gadulka, gaida, kaval and tupan. A distinguishing feature is extended rhythmical time, which has no equivalent in the rest of European music.[24] The State Television Female Vocal Choir won a Grammy Award in 1990 for its performances of Bulgarian folk music.[361] Written musical composition can be traced back to the works of Yoan Kukuzel (c.\u20091280\u20131360),[362] but modern classical music began with Emanuil Manolov, who composed the first Bulgarian opera in 1890.[345] Pancho Vladigerov and Petko Staynov further enriched symphony, ballet and opera, which singers Ghena Dimitrova, Boris Christoff, Ljuba Welitsch and Nicolai Ghiaurov elevated to a world-class level.[345][363][364][365][366][367][368][excessive citations]\nBulgarian performers have gained acclaim in other genres like electropop (Mira Aroyo), jazz (Milcho Leviev) and blends of jazz and folk (Ivo Papazov).[345]\nThe Bulgarian National Radio, bTV and daily newspapers Trud, Dnevnik and 24 Chasa are some of the largest national media outlets.[369] Bulgarian media were described as generally unbiased in their reporting in the early 2000s and print media had no legal restrictions.[370] Since then, freedom of the press has deteriorated to the point where Bulgaria scores 111th globally in the World Press Freedom Index, lower than all European Union members and membership candidate states. The government has diverted EU funds to sympathetic media outlets and bribed others to be less critical on problematic topics, while attacks against individual journalists have increased.[371][372] Collusion between politicians, oligarchs and the media is widespread.[371]\nBulgarian cuisine is similar to that of other Balkan countries and demonstrates strong Turkish and Greek influences.[373] Yogurt, lukanka, banitsa, shopska salad, lyutenitsa and kozunak are among the best-known local foods. Meat consumption is lower than the European average, given a cultural preference for a large variety of salads.[373] Bulgaria was the world's second-largest wine exporter until 1989, but has since lost that position.[374][375] The 2016 harvest yielded 128 million litres of wine, of which 62 million was exported mainly to Romania, Poland and Russia.[376] Mavrud, Rubin, Shiroka melnishka, Dimiat and Cherven Misket are the typical grapes used in Bulgarian wine.[377] Rakia is a traditional fruit brandy that was consumed in Bulgaria as early as the 14th century.[378]\nBulgaria appeared at the first modern Olympic games in 1896, when it was represented by gymnast Charles Champaud.[379] Since then, Bulgarian athletes have won 55 gold, 90 silver, and 85 bronze medals,[380] ranking 25th in the all-time medal table. Weight-lifting is a signature sport of Bulgaria. Coach Ivan Abadzhiev developed innovative training practices that have produced many Bulgarian world and Olympic champions in weight-lifting since the 1980s.[381] Bulgarian athletes have also excelled in wrestling, boxing, gymnastics, volleyball and tennis.[381] Stefka Kostadinova is the reigning world record holder in the women's high jump at 2.09 metres (6\u00a0feet 10\u00a0inches), achieved during the 1987 World Championships.[382] Grigor Dimitrov is the first Bulgarian tennis player in the Top 3 ATP rankings.[383]\nFootball is the most popular sport in the country by a substantial margin. The national football team's best performance was a semi-final at the 1994 FIFA World Cup, when the squad was spearheaded by forward Hristo Stoichkov.[381] Stoichkov is the most successful Bulgarian player of all time; he was awarded the Golden Boot and the Golden Ball and was considered one of the best in the world while playing for FC Barcelona in the 1990s.[384][385] CSKA and Levski, both based in Sofia,[381] are the most successful clubs domestically and long-standing rivals.[386] Ludogorets is remarkable for having advanced from the local fourth division to the 2014\u201315 UEFA Champions League group stage in a mere nine years.[387] Placed 39th in 2018, it is Bulgaria's highest-ranked club in UEFA.[388]", "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria", "

faces no-confidence vote over corruption | Reuters": {"text": "Discover Thomson Reuters\nBy Angel Krasimirov\n3 Min Read\nSOFIA (Reuters) - Bulgaria\u2019s main opposition party filed a motion of no-confidence in Prime Minister Boyko Borissov\u2019s government on Wednesday over lack of progress in fighting corruption but the attempt is likely to fail.\nThe center-right government is backed by a small populist party and if the bloc abstains in next week\u2019s vote the Socialist Party (BSP) motion will fall 41 votes short of the number it needs to topple the coalition in the 240-seat parliament.\nBorissov\u2019s GERB party and junior coalition partner, the nationalist formation United Patriots, have 133 votes along with the populist Will party.\n\u201cThe no-confidence vote is not sabotage but a response to 83 percent of Bulgarian citizens who think this is their number one problem,\u201d Socialist party leader Kornelia Ninova said.\n\u201cCombating corruption is a pro-European policy, not an anti-European one. It is better to be alone against corruption than a be part of the status quo that defends corruption,\u201d Ninova said.\nThe European Commission has repeatedly rebuked the country for failing to prosecute and sentence corrupt officials.\nBulgaria, the European Union\u2019s poorest country, assumed the six-month, rotating presidency of the bloc two weeks ago for the first time since it joined the EU in 2007.\nLast week demonstrations, some with an anti-corruption theme, blocked the capital Sofia as the country hosted ceremonies for the start of its EU presidency.[nL8N1P44SF]\n\u201cWhile the vote has little chance of succeeding, public protests are likely in the coming weeks,\u201d Otilia Dhand of Teneo Intelligence wrote in an analyst note.\n\u201cBorissov\u2019s efforts to maintain domestic political calm may strain coalition relations, increasing medium-term risks for government stability,\u201d Dhand said.\nCorruption has reduced foreign investment since communism collapsed in Bulgaria in 1989 and the EU has kept Sofia as well as neighboring Romania outside its Schengen zone of passport-free travel citing failings over its fight against graft.\nOn Friday, Bulgaria\u2019s parliament overturned a presidential veto on anti-graft legislation, clearing the way for the creation of a special unit to investigate individuals occupying high public office as well as assets and conflicts of interest.\nEditing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\nAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
